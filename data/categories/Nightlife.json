                "review": "Went here on Sunday for the annual Founders Cook Out. Showed up shortly after 2 and was in for a long long day of drinking and eating. The event started at 1, with the first special keg of KBS '15 being tapped at 2. Arrived right at the initial pouring. Got one of these extremely rare beers. We found friends in the upstairs mezzanine, and talked a waitress into allowing us to move a table next to theirs (even though there was a sign on the door that they wouldn't seat people until the full party had arrive; what is this, Black Dog?)As we got seated, I ordered the steak (at least a pound) rare. Locally sourced foods, cooked great. I can live with that. Kridz ordered the pretzel bites. Food arrived promptly (it doesn't take long to rare up a steak). Served with some delicious veggies and something else on the plate, that I don't remember. Steak was awesome. I was really in the mood for steak. The pretzel bites were pretzely and bitey. Served with their cheese sauce made with dirty bastard (I believe) it went well with the founders theme. There was founders schwag on the table. We left it, I don't really need anymore beer schwag, and if I did, i'd just call up a rep and ask for some. As I finished my kbs, I ordered an All Day IPA. Because, well, I was going to be drinking all day. As our friends left, we migrated downstairs. The bar was full, so we sat by another friend who was playing pool. Our waitress that we had upstairs kept us for the whole day, and was very attentive, filling our waters and letting us know when the next tapping was coming up (even when we were sitting at the bar). The second special tapping hit at 4 pm. It was KBS 14. The harsher bourbon notes that were more present in the newer model, had muted. It was a very nice sipper. No serious alcohol burn either. Good notes of dark chocolate, a little figgy and dark fruits (think a little raisin), on a nice base of beer. It might come across as a little chalky, but still a darn good beer. After we moved to the bar (by another friend), we had asked what the deserts were. There was a chocolate cake, and a cheese cake. I love cheese cake. Well, our waitress overheard us talking and put one in. I don't think we were ready for it, but what the heck. Cheese cake showed up, i'm not NOT going to eat it!At this time, (just after 4) I texted a buddy informing him of the event, he loves kbs, claims it's his favorite beer. But he couldn't come, because his wife is a paramedic and she was on duty, and he had the kid. I told him CBS was being tapped at 6, and that he had 2 hours to find a babysitter. I don't think he tried. Well, I informed him that I planned on having a $125 tab, and with the addition of the cheese cake, it was probably gonna be $150. At 6, we ordered the CBS. It's flavors were much sweeter (as it's been aged in bourbon then maple syrup barrels). Not quite as chalky. Good maple notes. Would go good with pancakes. At this point, someone down the bar had their food delivered. They got the pork belly. A friggin half pound of pork belly. It looked like heaven. I was tempted to order that as well. I was seriously VERY close to ordering that as well. It's like... a half pound of extremely tender BACON!!!I somehow managed not to get that. :(Then we left. Come back next year. Oh, went back on Tuesday night and had another KBS 14. Then went back on Wednesday for the beer club. (you don't know about beer club?)",

Well, now the Office is closed, and I feel like Crane Alley is shell of what it used to be.  In fact, I never go out in Urbana anymore.One star for serving food all night, and one star for never being too crowded and loud.  If I only have expectations to hang out with friends at night, I'm not disappointed.  I loved the food about 3 - 6 years ago, but recently, the food quality has declined and the service is horrible.  We met up with friends there, they had been there for about an hour.  Let's just say we got our food before their order was taken.  We were at adjacent tables outside.  At lunchtime.  Bad.Why the third star?  This is where my boyfriend and I went on our first date over three years ago.  Obviously, it was a good date.",

                "review": "I recently made a trip back to Crane Alley for dinner, and was dismayed by the alterations to the menu, primarily the price.  I remember buying affordable sandwiches for around $6, but all sandwiches have been bumped up to the $8 to $9 range.  ($8.50 for a falafel sandwich!?  Really!?  Those falafels are little nuggets of luxury now...) Quality of the food ranges from standard to good, though there is usually nothing here that smacks of culinary sophistication (especially to justify charging $8.50 for a falafel sandwich!!).  When I'm feeling indulgent, I order the fish sandwich, which is all the greasy, crunchy-crusted fish I could want.  Appetizers here are decent.  The spinach and artichoke dip tastes like every homemade version I've sampled from friends' kitchens.  The beet chips with goat cheese are considered one of their hallmark dishes.  I agree they're good--when prepared properly.  It's a gamble.  Because of the color of the beets, I think it's difficult to distinguish when they're finished cooking; I often get beet chips that taste like black charcoal.When friends propose coming here for happy hour after work, I just kind of dread it.  Crane Alley presents itself as a bar/pub, but they are more like a formal restaurant that expects everyone to stay in their assigned seats.  As someone who's waited tables in the past, I know large groups are challenging, but the waitresses here look downright insulted when they realize they have to serve our table.  They mostly avoid our group and hope that we won't ask for anything more than one meal and one drink.  Once, we showed up at a busy hour with a group of 8 and had to wait to be seated.  No big deal.  No one was complaining, we just stood in a group and chatted amongst ourselves.  After a few minutes, the hostess approached us, obviously annoyed, and said, \"If you have a group this big in the future, you're going to have to call in advance to make a reservation.\"  ...Ugh, really?Sadly, downtown Urbana does not offer many options for night life, especially if you want to have a nice drink with your meal.  Crane Alley has broad appeal and is a general crowd-pleaser, so it is a safe option for a date or outing with friends.  Just make sure you don't bring too many friends.",

I would stop in every now and again, but not very frequently due to the prices.The last time I went was about 5 months ago.  I don't know what happened, but the food was TERRIBLE!  I had butternut squash ravioli in a cream sauce and it was just awful.  No flavor, completely devoid of seasoning and the \"sauce\" may have been the Elmer's paste that comes in the little tubs with the brush attached to the cap.  It was actually grey in color.  Gross.  My husband had a chicken sandwich and it was small, cold, and cost about three times what he'd have paid for the exact same sandwich (quality wise) from McDonald's.The evening set us back about 60 bucks for a salad, appetizer, two entrees and two draft beers, which is pricey for CU.  So not worth it.  We have no plans to go back.",

What kind of establishment tells customers (who are seated and hungry) that they cannot order food? What a joke! We asked for salsa and chips and were told that we could not order anything. It took everything in our power not to walk out. Once we finally were able to order, the staff and management stared at our table and could not wait to take our plates. I was not even done and told the manager to leave my plate. This place is ran poorly and needless to say, our group won't be back! There are many better places to eat in the CU area!",

There is a nice beer garden in the alley next to the bar. Plenty of goodies on tap and in bottles. Boulevard Smokestack offerings, some Flossmoor Station, Two Brothers, DFH .  A really good bottle list too.  I believe they also have a monthly beer club that meets here as well.The food is great. Lots of sandwiches and several other entrees that are top notch. They have the best fish sandwich in Champaing/Urbana. A good burger and Reuben.  About the only thing I have to complain about is the service. The waitresses can be slow and don't always get the order right. Besides that a great place to quaff some quality beers in downtown Urbana.",

                "review": "Crane Alley is by far the best Urbana bar. Well, okay, maybe that's not saying much, but this place does stand on its merits. It's equal parts restaurant and bar; you can get a drink or a meal whether you're at a table or the bar. There are also a couple of pool tables across from the bar, and when it's warm out you can sit at a table in the eponymous alley next to the bar. (Do this at night--it can feel downright romantic beneath the strings of little lightbulbs.)Crane Alley has an excellent beer selection. They always have a dozen or so good ones on tap, and the bartenders and servers are knowledgeable enough to give recommendations. (I think they do beer tastings and whiskey tastings, although I've never been.) The liquor selection is good, with an emphasis on whiskey, and there are a couple of menu pages dedicated to sweet cocktails. I usually ordered beer here but the few mixed drinks I had were well-made.Food-wise, they serve burgers, pasta, steaks, and appetizers. I was an especially big fan of the Portobello mushroom sandwich (a burger-type sandwich with a mushroom instead of meat, and roasted red pepper, feta, and pesto) and the potato pancakes (a decently-sized appetizer that comes with asparagus and a tasty cream sauce). My only complaint about this place is that some of the meals feel overpriced--my friend ordered the hanger steak once and it was not $16 worth of steak. Oh, and I wish they had kept the beet chips on the menu; paired with a goat cream cheese for dipping, they were awesome, but they disappeared from the menu sometime last year.Downtown Urbana actually has a handful of restaurants and bars, but for whatever reason most of them feel like exclusively townie haunts. Crane Alley and Black Dog are the two exceptions, and unless you're specifically in the mood for barbecue and are willing to wait an hour for a table at Black Dog, Crane Alley is the place to go. It's too far from campus for the undergrads, so it's usually a mix of grad students and professionals. You can eat a burger at the bar, you can grab a beer and play pool, or you can treat your date to fancy cocktails and a nice dinner in the upstairs loft. Highly recommended.",

I will say though that if you go to Crane Alley, it's not as cheap as some of the other area restaurants (esp. not the alcohol). Another thing my friends and I noticed is that if you get appetizers, they normally give you way more dipping material (hummus, spinach and artichoke dip, etc.) than you can use up with the pita provided. You will get charged extra if you ask for more pita.They always have a nice selection of beverages, particularly beers, but there's a cocktail list as well (again, just plan on it being pricey). If fresh and local is important to you, they also sometimes have menu items made from products of sellers you might see at Market at the Square in the summer. In the end, it's a great place to go when the weather is nice and you can sit outside in the evening with your friends in the actual alley part of Crane Alley.",

It was, like, one of the most yummy things I've ever had. I never saw it again :(. I came back here, I think, three more times. Still yummy and then progressively less so. I think two of my least favorite things that I've tried (here and in my life time) were their spaghetti and lamb meatballs (which was laughably overpriced for how it tasted) and their Cuban sandwich. The spaghetti dish was bland and mushy. The lamb uninteresting. It was a comforting meal, but seriously disappointing for its price and for the standards to which I held Crane. It... sort of tasted like Chef Boyardee. I like Chef Boyardee (I know, guilty, repugnant pleasure), so I'm not saying I absolutely despised it. Just... Not great. The Cuban sandwich broke my heart. It really did. I was expecting a Cuban... Like, you know, a pressed Cuban sandwich. Like, you know, a Cuban. Well, it came on a sub, not pressed, and sliding around in its mayo. Not pressed. Not impressed.I'd most definitely come back for the salmon burger though.",

Now I live really really close to the infamous Kuma's Corner in Chicago--their burgers are so famous they've been featured on the Food Network.

Today I had the special--1/2 burger with mole, roasted chilies, pork shoulder, and chihuahua cheese--oooohhhh yes.Aside from tasty burgers, their beer selection rocks.  They literally have one full page of IPAs.  And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Their draft beers (which I believe rotate?) are quality as well.  The place is big, their outdoor (alley) seating is great in the summer, and the service is good.Though I must warn you... my first time (in the summer) was during some crayfish special... tables of rowdy bikers cheered on ladies in leather bumping and grinding in their laps.

When I brought it to the waitresses attention, she argued the point. Finally, we were able to demonstrate that the beer really was less than 12 ounces and she took $1 off the price of the bill. I prefer restaurants who take their customers more seriously than this.",

You can sit at the bar and enjoy, shoot some pool with your friends, or you can have a more private table in the back 2 stories of the restaurant that are quite and comfortable for having a nice meal. Then during the warmer months, you can sit outside on the sidewalk or in their quaint, creatively-decorated alley that is right next to the building (hence the name Crane Alley). The ambiance out there is top notch and I would highly recommend it any time the weather is nice!",

In addition, it will have more than 10 draft beers at any one time from various microbreweries and craft breweries.  The reasons to stop by don't stop there, since there is also a fairly extensive menu of tavern-style food, which is higher quality than what one usually comes across.My favorite appetizer is Crane Alley's signature beet chips. Every table around us got this appetizer, since it is one of the dishes that Crane Alley is most known for. The beet chips come with a bowl of a goat cheese dip (which has cream cheese mixed in). The dip is somewhat rich and heavy, and helps to bulk up what might otherwise be a rather light appetizer.The sandwiches at Crane Alley run up to around $10, and the main courses a bit higher than that. Last visit, my girlfriend got a portabella mushroom burger, which was one of the daily specials, and of course had no meat. However, it was bulky enough to offset that and not be as light and unfilling as a lot of vegetarian food ends up being. I got a beer-battered fish sandwich, which was crispy and fairly large (way too much fish for the bun), along with the sweet potato fries (another thing Crane Alley is known for). One of the complaints I usually have about fried fish sandwiches is how greasy they are, but luckily this sandwich didn't fall into that trap.The primary lure that Crane Alley has is its wide selection of beers and drinks, which can be ordered alongside a selection of appetizers or food (something some local competitors do not offer). In addition, it has weekly special dishes and daily specials, and special beer and food pairings on set dates (tickets must usually be purchased). I would highly recommend anyone in the area or at the university make the effort to stop here at least once.",

The patty was perfectly cooked and flavorful, and I could imagine obsessing over it like they did in the episode...TV-related gushing aside, I really like this place. We also tried the steak frites with gorgonzola butter on top, and those were wonderful, and the beer selection is great. I like trying the flights myself so I don't have to commit to a full version of any one thing.The normal fries are not great. Nothing especially wrong with them, just... not great. Also, the steak sandwich was good, but whereas the steak sandwiches I'm used to are best shared with at LEAST one other person, this is more of a one person sandwich, unless you're not that hungry.Be sure to keep up on their facebook page; they have awesome beer dinners or other cool events from time to time! I went to a great beer and chocolate pairing a few weeks ago, and keep hoping there will be another.",

It was competently fried and the sauce had a nice kick to it, albeit bordering on pizza sauce. We ordered the turkey pita sandwich and the chicken parm. Don't mistake that to mean that the sandwich was in the pocket. No, the fillings were served between two cold halves of pita. The chicken parm was mediocre at best, more likely just plain bad. Managed to burn the top of the mozzarella and still have borderline doneness on the breast. The worst part of it all is that this place is priced like a downtown Chicago eatery. I will say, the staff was courteous and friendly. Ultimately, this is a bar. If you want a plethora of beer and cocktail options and maybe a burger: go for it. If you want a decent meal at a reasonable price: Steer clear.",

At that point, we were told the wait would be 20-40 minutes.  After an hour, still with empty tables, we went to ask.  She said she'd seat us in 10 minutes... and finally 30 minutes later after bugging her twice more, she got us a table.  The bartenders actually compted us the pool because they felt so bad.That being said, our waitress was very friendly, though not always present, but very accommodating.  Food was ok, but we were annoyed that we waited 1.5 hours to be seated when there were empty tables the entire time... we started to wonder if she was mad at certain wait staff members and trying to spite them by not sitting people in their sections. That being said, I have had much better experiences there, and I hope that never happens to anyone else.",

                "review": "Stopped by here for lunch/dinner (it was 3...what meal does that count as?); it was pretty quiet since we didn't come during regular lunch/dinner hours.  Crane Alley is a \"Restaurant & Bar\" but it definitely feels more like a bar than a restaurant--it's very dimly lit, there are pool tables and a large bar area.  I guess if you like bars/feel comfortable in bars you probably won't notice this.I got the veggie sandwich and it was amazingly good.  Please allow me to list the ingredients of this most tasty of sandwiches: cucumber, bell peppers, onion, tomato, sprouts, lettuce, basil oil, sunflower seeds and dill cream cheese, all on two big slices of wheat bread.  The greek pasta salad was also tasty, and overall it was a very satisfying, generous portioned meal for a little under $7.My boyfriend had a hamburger and it was HUGE.  The fries were good and he liked the burger (although he said it had some kind of seasoning on it, which he seemed kind of \"eh\" about).Between the two of us we spent about $15 (before tip and without any drinks).  Not bad.  The desserts also sounded really good (flourless chocolate cake...mmm...) but we passed on that this time.I'll definitely be back.  I feel like if I had any interest in beer then this would be my new favorite place, but since I'm not a fan of beer or bars in general, that's kind of a deterrent for me (completely aware I'm in the minority here).  Oh well.  I'll still come back for their yummy food.",

Sounded amazing but as it came, it was just a big bowl of chips and barely any sauce. It just seemed so plain and the ragout was just a dark mush of sauce that seemed like it came from a can. Nothing about it was special and this cost $14. I asked the waitress for more sauce seeing that most of our chips were very bare, and later when the bill came, she had charged us for the additional sauce. When telling her we ordered more sauce because the chips barely had any, she said \"I'll take off the charge, Jesus Christ.\" She was definitely rude and hostile--unnecessarily. If the kitchen messed up and didn't add enough sauce, you don't really need to charge the customer.Either way, Crane Alley isn't on my list of placed I'd check out again. I'd rather check out Farren's in Champaign. The recent service and food option was definitely not something I'd want to experience again. Thanks, but no thanks Crane.",

Eating here three times, I have been very disappointed twice with my own meal and all three times with some aspect of the dining experience. Their menu sounds good, but is perhaps beyond the skill of its staff, as they often fail to deliver. Sauces are either too thin or too thick, either tasteless or too salty, and  every time at least one item was served too cold (even when it was just 2 of us). If you are the type that likes to occasionally order an appetizer for your entree, think again: many apps are really skimpy. Also, food service can be very slow at times, as I think they stretch their servers too thin. They also have very few vegetarian options, which surprises me, based upon their clientele.Notice how all these comments are about food? That is because their alcohol service, selection, and quality are all beyond reproach. Their prices, including their alcohol prices, are pretty high for what you get. For the alcohol, I can justify this to cover the cost of carrying obscure barley wines (tremendous); to charge high prices for the food, is absolutely unacceptable. EAT at V. Picasso's, Courier Cafe, Bunny's, Tang Dynasty, The Great Impasta, Xinh Xinh, Black Dog, Silver Creek, or even Siam Terrace, then DRINK at Crane Alley.",

I wish they had a few cheaper, more suited to a bar kind of appetizers than they do, especially since their above average overall food quality would make fantastic late night snacks.

I'm going to agree with that assessment: mostly good!I had the portobello sandwich, with peppers and a nice pesto topping. I was sort of disappointed when my friend said she wasn't into beet chips as an appetizer, but completely excited when I saw I could substitute my fries for beet chips! Yay! We ended up sharing the spinach and artichoke dip app. It came with toasted pita slices. Mmmmm. The food was interesting, and it was good. It wasn't fantastic, or mind-blowing, but it was solid, and the menu had a good variety of selections. The price wasn't super cheap, but it wasn't outrageous for lunch. My sandwich (plus beet chips, which do carry a surcharge as a substitution), my friend's entree (a bowl of the soup of the day and a Reuben), one soft drink and our appetizer = 28.79 before tip. The drink menu is HUGE! I'd love to come back for dinner and drinks sometime. The ambiance screams \"You're in a bar!!\" which considering that, hey! you're in a bar, that works. It was cozy, the lighting was low, the booths black - might be a nice place for a casual date. The one aspect that shone above all was the service. Our waiter was FANTASTIC. He was knowledgeable about the menu, helpful without being pushy or overbearing, very attentive, we had regular drink refills but he didn't make it hard for us to continue our conversation. He even brought us an assortment of to-go containers so we could keep the dip and pita chips separate - what a guy! That waiter deserves five stars (and a large tip)!",

Problem is - the pretzel dough wasn't baked today (maybe not even yesterday?)  - they take the pre-baked bites and put them in the (microwave?) oven for a few minutes and bring them out.  If you eat them fast you'll be okay...but once they start to cool they get hard (like - very hard!)  They come with cheese, which is - cheese.  Nothing special about it.The reality is that my appetizer experience (and the lackadaisical attitude when I asked about the appetizer) kind of turned me off.  I didn't really make it past the apps...  Being a \"gastropub\" I expected a bit more - like at least freshly prepared food - out of this place.  When I'm sitting at a table my appetizer doesn't need to come out at McDonalds speed (if I wanted that, I'd have gone to Mickey D's) - do it right and live up to the \"gastropub\" name.If you're eating *and* drinking, this is the kind of place to walk away from.",

The sweet potato fries are a must try, and I also love the turkey pita sandwich! Also a great selection of beers and full bar, not to mention a great atmosphere. I love to sit in the alley in the summer! Definitely one of my favorite spots at home!",

Only after I graduated and moved away did I come to like beer and realize how many opportunities I had missed in Champaign/Urbana...So when I was in town visiting, I finally had a chance to go here.  I thought the beer selection was good, but I would have preferred more options on tap.  Because I'm used to the higher cost of living in Ann Arbor, the beer prices seemed reasonable, especially for flights.  That said, I expected them to be slightly lower, since it's Urbana and not Ann Arbor.The menu looked great.  I got the porter marinated steak and was really excited because everything about it sounded like exactly what I wanted.  The food was somewhat disappointing, though.  I wouldn't say it was bad, but it was a little bland and just didn't live up to my expectations.  If I come back, I'd probably just get a burger or sandwich.Service was fine.  Our waitress checked on us just enough, and food came out in a reasonable amount of time.I'd definitely stop here again if I'm in the area, but I wouldn't be too upset if I couldn't.",

This place features all kinds of local beers from the IL area in addition to featuring a ton of other great microbrews from across the country. I wouldn't come here in a rush because you need some time to actually read through all of their beer selections there are that many! It is a mini binder, so come ready to read about beer, taste beer, and enjoy beer, and then maybe even play a little pool (until the pool league comes in that is, since they have a league here a few days a week!). They also have beer samplers and I have to say that Matt J. and I were very impressed with our bar tender in that she not only remembered the 10 different beers we ordered, but then recited them back in order in increasing light to dark beers as well. Amazing. That is the type of bar tender at a great beer place that you want. So hat's off to her! The food looked pretty good here too and everyone here just seemed happy in general. It is a darker bar restaurant on the inside so good for group outings or dates I would say, but if you don't like beer, you will be missing the main draw of this place!",

The breaded chicken breast was crispy and cooked to perfection.Buffalo Chicken Sandwich- very good- HUGE portion. I prefer to get the Buffalo sauce and ranch (can't have blue cheese while pregnant) on the side and dip- otherwise the breading gets soggy. Chicken is very well cooked. Italian Roast Beef- the beef used was too lean- it was dry and chewy. Would benefit from using ribeye (like on a good Philly cheesesteak) or a well braised chuck roast that has enough fat to keep the meat tender. The au jus was not very flavorful- tasted mostly like oil + red pepper flakes. Nice beer list- they have beer dinners, ($65 or $75), but they wont' discount the ticket if you are unable to drink alcohol (e.g. pregnant me)- otherwise my husband and I would have loved to have gone to one.",

The beer selection here is impressive, covering a wide range of styles and breweries from around the country.  I consider myself fairly familiar with the microbrew landscape, and yet they still had about 12 beers that I had never even heard of, plus, Crane Alley does modestly priced flights of 4 x 5 ounce tasters ($6 + a buck for the really obscure  choices).

He said he hear it was good. It wasn't. Before I begin, the food wasn't bad per say but it wasn't great. And for the price of the burger I got. It DEFINITELY wasn't worth it. I got the 15$ burger thinking, well it's the most expensive one, should be pretty tasty right? WRONG. I substituted the fries for the soup of the day which was jambalaya. +2.50$. Blah. The jambalaya was actually pretty decent. Not amazing but it was pretty hardy. The burger came out and it just seemed like crane alley was trying to do too much on one burger. It had blue cheese, Dijon mustard, bacon and a few other things that didn't go together great. I've also forgot the name of the burger. It was the only one over 14$I almost gave this place 2 stars but I felt kinda bad because it seems like they have a good beer selection and the staff is very polite. Would I go back? Probably not. Rather spend my money on the better places to eat in Urbana champaign. :-)  I would consider going back for a drink but nothing else.",

Charming interior, prompt service, and tasty eats!Holiday fate included Irish stew, corned beef & cabbage, rare bit, Irish soda bread, and a platter of all of the above. Of course, I opted for the platter to get a taste of everything.- Corned beef and cabbage was nice spotted in the Irish stew. Mmm...- Rare bit - basically cheese on toast, was horrid. Soggy bread with fake, melted cheese on it. - Irish soda bread - classic!- Irish stew - infused with lamb, potatoes, and veggies. Very nice on a cold, windy day.As for drink, I had my usual Strongbow. They don't have it on tap, just in a bottle. Eh, next best thing. Can't stand the taste of it out of those yucky cans.",

I enjoy the lunch half and half option with the garden salad and soup du jour. The vinaigrette dressing is tasty.Cons:Price -- a little hefty compared to other restaurants in town. A beer will typically cost $7 - $8. A sandwich at lunch is around $11-$13. I would definitely recommend bar service if you have a small party. Service is much faster!",

When I got that urge, Crane Alley was one of the options.  When they put out the tables, and the tiny lights are lit, sitting in that alley, traffic passing by, it's easy to forget-- the stress of the day, the problems at the other end.  But, booze is booze and as far as CA is concerned, unless you're drinking off the tap (which is a good option), it don't come cheap.I will say this... drinking here is a different experience.  There's a sleazy undertone, stuff's dirty, bartenders (and even the barbacks!) are rude (dismissive).  And it's not because they aren't making tips... leave your money on the bar, and they'll just help themselves (had it happen numerous times to me... as a matter of fact, one actually wrote _in_ her tip on my credit card, once).  I wouldn't spend the money on the food.  You can find a hundred different places near to have a better meal.  If you're just gnoshing to keep up with the liquor, that's one thing, but if you want a bite with a beer, try everyone's favorite, Farren's! =DAll together, if it's what you're looking for, CA fits the bill.  There are better places out there, though.",

Could lunch get any more divine?! This may not be the fanciest bar, but it has a warm, homey environment. Coupled with a friendly staff and delicious bae food, you can't go wrong. Their loaded fries are bomb and the fish sandwiches are definitely worth the waits. Lent is coming up, people, and this is where you want to spend your Fridays! You can quiet your Catholic guilt by indulging in the fish while drowning your overindulgence in favorite beers.",

A great place for happy hours, and just the occasional night out. Also, you cannot have a barcrawl if it doesn't go to Legends.If only they would stop repainting the exterior wackier and wackier every 2 years...",

We also really enjoyed the outdoor seating area out back. Oh by the way, next time you are there, order a Sex on the Beach.

Legends is a pretty laid back bar where you can get together with friends and have a couple drinks.  Not really the type of place to dance, but there's Joe's and Cly's if that's what you're looking for.  In addition to Guinness on tap, they had a handful of other beers as well as a pretty extensive bottled beer list.  Prices were reasonable too, $4.75 for a Dead Guy and $4.50 for a Killians.  Another bonus was that the bartender serving me was very cute.  Definitely will be back in the future to grab a beer with some friends and watch some games.",

The real annoying part of this place is the food is ordered at the bar than picked up by you when the number is called.  There is no hostess or waitstaff all self serve and first come first serve on tables.  You could be waiting hours for a table at this place recommend you get there at 6:00pm before the late night rush!!!",

Deluxe is no more but this structure sits on the burial ground of where Deluxe once stood.  i try not to think about Deluxe when i'm in legends otherwise i feel like i'm looking for my dead dog among a litter of perfectly fresh purebred puppies.  You kind of have to treat Legends this way, like a fresh puppy.  Grow with it, create your own tricks together, develop a routine, find comfort in it, know it's always there when you need it.If you can detect different ratios of pepsi syrup to carbonated water when you drink a fountain pepsi, i challenge you find a better ratio than what is going on here.  it's a science and they have the titration juuuuust right.  when i used to consume a juicy burger, this was my destination of choice.  now i thoroughly enjoy the greek wrap minus the chicken and still feel i have consumed enough oil to be guilty.  the fries are awesome too.  good university crowd to go along with all the university memorabelia on the walls.  nice staff primarily made up of college kids from the suburbs who always seem to smile and do their jobs well.  the fish sandwich still exists on fridays but i just haven't been able to bring myself to consume one...",

I've been there a couple of times to watch various sporting events, and I love how the staff will obligingly change the channel for you if you want to see a different game. However, the hamburgers are a bit weak. My boyfriend and I went there after the depressing Illinois-Penn State game this past weekend and we were starving. Admittedly we were drunk too, but we were immediately hungry after we ate our burgers. Also I don't think the burgers come with fries. We were a bit disappointed to see bags of chips. I do like the way you can put your own stuff on the burgers and all, and the toppings are nice and fresh. Maybe next time I'll order something else! I am nothing if not magnanimous.",

Legends is the perfect place to stroll into with a big group of people, as there's rarely a line and with the bar in the middle of the building, it's accessible from wherever your group decides to sit.No, you can't really get your dance on here, even though there's a lot of space...but if you're just looking to get a good buzz, you won't miss that.  The large area does make it enjoyable for happy hours though.Food's pretty good.  I like Murphy's burgers better, but I like the ranch chicken sandwiches and fish sandwiches from here.It's not the most bumpin' bar in Champaign, but it's the best place to come and chill with some friends.  Or roll in with a ton of people, take up a quarter of the bar, and do shots until they kick you out.  Either way.",

An extra star because they sell playing cards for a buck. Really cheap, awful, uncoated, unshufflable, undealable, soak up beer faster than any paper I've ever seen playing cards, but playing cards all the same. My friends and I aren't smart enough to bring our own, so this saves us. But they lose a star for having recently eliminated the internet jukebox and added a DJ. How else can we play \"In the Air Tonight\" to kill the mood at 1am? We actually paid the dude a fiver and left him an iPod to get something played that wasn't part of the standard littany of horrible bar songs.",

Legends' best attributes are the many TV's available to take in the game and the space for people to spread out.  If you're nice and it's not too busy the staff might even put on the game you request.  It's not too tough for a few people to lock down a good chunk of space here which is what makes it a winner.  The patio is a decent size and appealing when it's nice out.The prices are about campus average and the tap selection sucks.  The main draw is coming here on Wednesday and doing the venerable \"School of Beer\" (which should be renamed \"Buy our entire bottle list\") which features more enjoyable selections than what is on draft and awesome prices ($4 max per beer, usually less).Definitely my go-to if I feel like drinking on campus without being heavily annoyed.  Also, if you look like someone who used to work here, current employees will ask to take their picture with you or stare at you from across the bar.",

The place is setup quite a bit like a restaurant with all the booths and tables in the place, and with waitresses that come around and try to get you to order more drinks. However, the burgers here are really bad: they seem to be cheap, frozen, store-bought patties that are generally overcooked and not so tasty.  Their prices don't make up for it either; who wants to pay $6 for a burger that is worse than McDonald's? The bar portion also pretty bad.  It's always hard to get the attention of the bartenders.  Once you do get their attention, you're likely in for some crappy tasting beer.  All the taps here taste a little foul; maybe they just don't know how to clean them?  The good side of Legends is that it's almost never crowded, and usually not too loud.  They also have a few projectors they use to show Illini games, so that can be nice.  So, if you're not too much of a beer snob, this isn't a bad place to go and knock a few back.",

I had one bad experience with a pink-centered \"southern chicken sandwich\" (not southern.. just fried) but when I showed it to the guy, he made me a whole new basket and let me keep the fries from the old one. The employees have always been very nice. I had the fish sandwich deluxe ($7.19 on fridays) for the first time this weekend and it is very veryyyy tasty!

Their food is actually pretty decent. Not overly amazing but pretty good as far as bar food goes. GO EARLY. If you try to go on a ride the rail night and you get there late the line is insane and it takes forever to get a drink. The worst is when its all beer specials and you have to wait for someone to get their Margaritta or fruity mixed drinks. Come on its beer specials thats why everyone is here, move out of the way!!! this is def a day drinking bar.",

But it's my favorite and thus 5 stars.Great atmosphere, never overly crowded the way some of the other dumps on campus are, often you're able to grab a seat, even on some of the busiest nights. My favorite night was Tuesday nights - Ride the Rail, and yes I completed my rail card senior year. I've got my name up on the wall which is very cool but I've got so many great memories of sitting around having beers with friends. And, I have to say, the beer selection's pretty good actually. They always have a few good drafts on top of the normal college bar cheap, watered down stuff. Nothing elaborate, but good quality mass produced stuff - Sam Adams Seasonals, Woodchuck, etc.The food's surprisingly good as well. I would say Firehaus has better food, but as far as green street bars go, that's probably it. I generally stuck with burgers or chicken sandwiches and they have a good selection of toppings to put on whatever food you get.But you really go to Legends for the atmosphere. It's an upperclassman bar where you can go to actually hang out and talk with friends. They have good music playing in the background but it's never all that loud and it's stuff you want to listen to anyway. They've got some slot machines and pool tables now which also make for a good time and there's a dressed model of the Chief up front which is a welcome sight for any Illini.",

Their burgers are also really enjoyable. All of the toppings are self serve which I really enjoy because then I can add exactly what I like. Definitely a place to check out if you are in need of an ice cold draft and burger.",

Despite saying that we could pay however we'd like and she just needed a card to \"hold\", she insisted on swiping the one card for the whole bill.  The reason: \"It's just too busy to bring you the check\".  If that was a busy night, I would hate to see what that place looks like when it's slow.  The icing on the proverbial cake was the *BROKEN GLASS* I found in my cocktail.  The server was disinterested in my future digestive issues resulting from the shards of glass and lurked over the table as we signed the check.",

They have a full bar and play whatever the current hits are at night, but no one actually dances sans a helluva lot of alcohol.  It's also a great place to go on game days as they have a nice, big, flat-screen TV, and plenty of booths/bar stools to crowd around, watch, and cheer for your team.  Go Illini!",

It really seems like they have everything here.I have yet to actually try the food, but I've heard the sandwiches are pretty good. They do have Hooked deals from time to time which is a nice touch.Overall probably not the most exciting or club-like bar on campus, not somewhere to go dance your brains out and make an ass of yourself.

But straying from those favorites might make you wish you hadn't. (Case in point, I had the grilled cheese with tomato and it came out entirely sopping with butter.) They do have an island, though, that offers up all the best condiments - make sure to try the pickles, they're out of this world! Food comes out fairly fast, though it can be unreliable in a party of more than two.  Food is always at the right temperature and they make french fries just the way I like them, crisp and not greasy!  Don't go to Legends to drink.  As a matter of fact, outside of a few places in town, I recommend doing your drinking at home (your wallet will thank you).  The prices are insane and watching them measure out your liquor makes it feel like you're getting shafted.  Legends is also not a place to go if you want to skip big crowds on weekends.  It's usually packed on game days (whatever the game), but it's also relatively quiet on weekdays, so it's ideal for lunch.  Plus, they also have a parking lot (one of the only ones off Green) and that makes it a real keeper.",

The waitress said they are very busy but the place was at 40% capacity. I understand if things are going slow but the amount of time before we even got our menus was a little ridiculous.Second biggest problem is that nothing comes out at the same time. We had a party of 6 and 4 menus came out, before the next 2. Only 4 waters came out, before the best 2. All of our burgers came out at different times. Also, between each visit from our waitress, there is a long wait.Now the food. I got the California burger with onions rings. The burger was extremely bland, you hardly notice there is guacamole, bacon or basically anything. I'd be shocked if they even seasoned their burger patty. Only thing worth anything was their perfect onion rings. Today they had half off burgers, which is the only reason why anyone should try their burgers. At full price, I'd rather go to Burger King or TGIF.It's also unfortunate that their 2.00 bud light draft special was broken. I thought they'd replace the deal with something else other than can bud-a-ritas...If you really want to try this place come for half off burgers. On a Thursday. I'm thoroughly disappointed.",

The Bob Marley burger has some awesome stuff going on as well, just not as caliente as I like. The girls behind the bar never really seem to be on top of things, but I've never had an issue with service. This is a great spot for lunch or early dinner.",

Nobody tipped, and the food was lukewarm by the time she served us. We had to hound her to even pay for the meals. What a horrible waitress. She really should be fired.

I've been here a few times and tried their burgers. They're alright. The mac n' cheese side is an upcharge, but it's pretty good, very heavy. Recently, I ordered a veggie burger with no bun (not about to waste my carbs budget on some basic ass bun, ja feel?) and the whole bottom of the burger was burnt and seemed to have something stuck to underside of it. I'm guessing the grill just hadn't been cleaned in a while...If you want a good burger, go to Seven Saints or Destihl. If you're more of looking for a place with a college atmosphere, come on in. This place feels just like your local frat house.",

For traditional patties, you have to choose a 1/4 or 1/2 pound burger. The Mac & cheese isn't necessarily worth the $1 upgrade, so don't bother - unless you want to pay for boxed mac&cheese that has some bacon bits tossed on top. They have a good selection of beers and sodas (be aware that it's not Pepsi *or* Coke products but RC/Dr. Pepper). I thought the draft of Bell's two-hearted complemented my Urbana veggie burger quite nicely. If they'd offered ice cream for dessert, it would have been true love. Also, note that it was very crowded (and noisy) indoors but that they have an extensive patio. There was an upstairs space as well, but they apparently only open that for table service *some* of the time.",

I actually prefer a lot of their sauces over that big-chain wing place (which I won't name). The wings are really big and only 33 cents. I like that you can get as many of any flavor as your want without an extra charge. My favorite sauces are the jerk and tequila lime.Their sides and burgers are really good, too. {EDIT} We went to wing night again last night and got onion rings. I can't think of anyplace that has better onion rings. They're not frozen, obviously hand-dipped. They even give you the fried crumblies. Holy moly, they were so good. Nice staff, nice place. I like going here because it has a neighborhood bar feeling.",

It caters to bikers as well as family plus has a decent- sized  outdoor lounge. Food specials daily but Fish Fridays serve up the largest and best cod sandwichs in C-U hands down! Always clean, fun, and comfortable for what looks like a dive bar next to a strip club. Actually was built in a self serve car wash structure. With the new owners the place now rocks out with live bands. Check it out cause you won't be disappointed.",

Don't be. This place looks like an absolute murder-me-in-the-bathroom-and-serve-me-as-patty-melts-next-Tuesday shithole. Its not. Its a moderately divey outdated (vintage 1986 decor, probably ironic in hipsters' eyes) bar and grill. High points include a pretty new version of Golden Tee, a juke box, a friendly guy slinging drinks, and most rewarding: a fully integrated theme of boomerangs. I wont be a spoiler, but you will love pointing out all the boomerangs, like its Highlights magazine. They have domestic macros on tap, a full liquor selection and daily lunch and dinner specials. I'll probably go back for the Friday night fish fry.Bottom line: don't let the fact that it is next to a strip joint and bumps up to a pretty questionable area chase you away. If you are a diver, dive in.",

I assumed because this bar was located behind the silver bullet strip club that this would be a great dive. I was wrong. Upon entering the establishment I was greeted by the bright glow of lights. When I want to drink at a dive I want the lights dim. The bartender was nice but the place was empty. My girlfriend and I ordered our drinks and shot pool and joked about how at 9 o'clock on a Saturday we were their only customers. Eventually 3 regulars sat at the bar and when I went up to the bar one of them told me my girlfriend was pretty and he wondered if we were going to visit the bullet next door. That's enough to make me uncomfortable and bail on out. I might come back on their wing day for 33 cent wings but I will never come here to drink and unwind because the atmosphere sucked, the air was stale, seriously no fans or AC, and the clientele is either non existent or just a little too creepy for my liking. My search for a good old fashion dive in CU continues...",

The original location in downtown Champaign is a lot of fun, complete with a well-stocked bar, a few pool tables, and a CD juke box which all adds to the low-key atmosphere. My hubby and I went there on our first date and have been back many times since then.  It's not a dive bar, it's not super ritzy, it's always clean and to me, being there feels kind of like you've just gone over to your best friend's house to hang out for awhile.  It's never too loud, never too crazy, they have great service and they do a fantastic thin crust pizza.  My personal faves lie in a dead heat between their \"margherita\" and \"fajita\" pizza.  Though this isn't the only place to offer these selections, they blow away the competition.  Jup's isn't even in the same class with anyone else, it just is what it is (awesome) and I love that about the place.  They just get it perfect every time.",

To each their own I suppose, but quite frankly, it's probably my least favorite pizza around.  Pizza is way overpriced. A small personal 9\" pizza costs about $8, and I equate the taste to that of your microwaveable pizza bites. If you like pizza bites, well heck, then dig in. Their pizza to me is just like saltine crackers with mediocre sauce and stale cheese. Not only that, but food takes forever to come out.I get drug to this place with co-workers every now and then, and our small 9\" pizzas take 45 minutes to come out... That's ridiculous considering a pizza like this should cook in about 6 minutes.... On a plus note though, the servers are great and the atmosphere is nice, but ultimately I go out to eat for good food, and Jupiter's does not deliver.",

There is even a patio out back.  The building itself is ancient, and tons of character.The servers work hard, and are very friendly.  Though can get swamped during peak hours.  Just a couple of decent beers on tap.  Usually an offering from Bells, or Summit, and just recently I noticed Lagunitas.  The pizzas are great.  Crispy, thin crust that is awesome.  The specialty pizzas like Pizza Pesto is great.  Can't go wrong making your own as well.  They come in personal, 14\", and 16.\"  Always a good stop downtown for pizza, beer, and fun.",

Someone from Brooklyn a few reviews down has it spot on--tasted like a cracker. This not thin crust pizza. Any random pizzeria in NYC would have had infinitely better thin crust than what these pizzas had. This was cardboard crust pizza. I know this ain't exactly NYC, but for a 4-star joint, I had higher hopes. I would have given it 2 stars, but I added an extra one because it was open late night.",

Check that bill, people.It's pretty loud, people are playing pool and I saw a man so drunk in the men's room, he was stumbling and slamming into the walls face-first.

Especially since they don't have any specialty ingredients (though they do have a variety). Anyway there is nothing wrong flavor wise with the pizzas and I really appreciate how bone thin their crusts are (it's so hard to find crunchy crusts in Chambana). The atmosphere is also very nice. Relaxed. Mostly old people, townies. It's clean as well. But the pizza is much too small for the price. Maybe someone with a normal sized appetite can chime in.Update: I think I found out why I thought it was overpriced. I saw that the pizza was $7 on the menu (I just confirmed it). But was charged over $9. Why? I understand $7 is pre-tax but then, to be conservative, $9 flat would still go over the total. It's not a big difference but it's not acceptable to steal from customers, on purpose or accidentally. Here's the link to their menu with the prices: http://www.jupiterspizza.com/downtown/menu.htmlI got a custom 4-topping personal which should have been about $8 tops. Something that really bugs me about restaurants, as it should, is when they don't care what price they put on the menu and the servers will throw some extra on there because they're careless. Just not cool. Bombay Grill did this but their food is actually good enough that, fine, I'm okay with being stolen from-- take it as a tip. But Jupiter's food is not good enough to justify capricious pricing.",

Drinks weren't expensive, and overall there was a good selection.  A $4.50 Lindeman's Framboise is about $1.50 cheaper than the equivalent size at the Blind Pig, if that gives you an idea of the pricing.  I can't wait to go again, fantastic pizza and reasonable drinks.",

I went to the other one back in my college days, but this one I didn't even know existed. Walked in and it's seat yourself tables to the left, a bunch of pool tables to the front, and a long bar in the middle. Very limited seating, but it wasn't packed at all so that wasn't a problem. There was a weird draft hitting our table though, so we moved to one deeper in the corner since we thought it was the door, but the draft was there too. We just had to wear our coats throughout dinner.For 6 people, we ordered 2 large pizzas, one buffalo chicken, and one prosciutto. I didn't care much for the prosciutto, but the buffalo was pretty bomb. Ordered some small ranches (50 cents per though, what a rip) and it was delicious. It's deceptive that they cut their pizzas into smaller squares because you feel like you can eat so much more. We had 6 slices left over and it was about 42-ish dollars with tax and tip. So a large probably feeds 4 people comfortably, 3 uncomfortably.Weird thing though is when we asked for a box, the waitress asked if we wanted anything else. We said no and assumed she would bring us the check. But didn't and we sat there for like 10 more minutes. Had to grab her attention and then ask for the check. We weren't drinking or anything so I'm not sure why she thought we would want to just hang out. Minor inconvenience though so it's whatever.",

Warning to Chicago-native-deep-dish lovers: these pizzas are thin-crust pizzas and I'm from St. Louis, so we love thin crust pizzas, but this place does not rip you off on toppings. Jupiter's specialty pizzas are great!  There's no need to stress about perfecting your pizzas toppings since they already have specialty pizzas with your already-favorite toppings. If you want to make your own crazy masterpiece, you can customize your pizza with four toppings maximum (meat toppings count as two). More importantly, the price is very reasonable. Also this place has a clean, friendly, fun atmosphere. It's definitely one of my favorite places to go in downtown champaign. I recommend every U of I student to check this place out with friends there before graduation .",

We see families there quite often though, and I'm sure you can order out.

I also love the atmosphere; I don't play pool, but the building is gorgeous (I'm a sucker for the tin roof) and the place is lively. The garlic bread isn't really worth it, and the beer selection is kind of lame (all the domestic Big Three bottles you can drink!), which keeps it from five stars, but I like Jupiter's a lot.",

The only downside for me (hence not 5 stars) is the small number of outside tables, BUT I have always been able to sit outside. I reckon it would be cooler if there was more of an outside 'vibe' there, especially being a block out of the way from the other downtown restaurants... I am still a fan.",

The music is usually good (maybe more trendy for my tastes, but that doesn't take away from it, obsly).  What does, though, is their service.  Super slow.  It's usually _okay_ (the service that is), but I've had a rude bartender or two!  I suppose that comes with the rush of a fast paced and crowded bar on a Saturday night.All in all, I wouldn't say Jupiter is extremely outstanding, or extremely poor.  It's just a run of the mill bar in downtown Champaign (though, it could pretty much be places anywhere).  It offers some great entertainment, with some good refreshment (albeit expensive!!), with the option of a thin crust pizza!  Totally a three-starer!",

They only have a few beers on tap (bud, miller coors, fat tire and guiness are all I remember) however there are two pages of wine selections.  Seems like they might be shooting for an older crowd.The food was decent.  I had an order of hot wings, which were average, and a \"build your own\" burger.  The build your own concept is nice, but that is the only option.  It would be nice to have some \"already assembled\" burgers to choose from.  My wife got the ruben, which was horrible.  We sent it back and the manager told us there had been a lot of complaints about it.  The service was ok.  They forgot to put in the wings order and we were comped a drink.  This sort of thing happens in a new restaurants I guess.  Overall I think I would give them another chance and hopefully they get their shit together.",

Upon pushing through the masses and finally making it to the bar, I ordered two ciders, one for my boyfriend and one for myself. The bartender said confirmed I wanted hard cider and poured something from the tap i was unfamiliar with. I just assumed, because I hadn't specified, perhaps he just chose one i didn't know. But it was ale. I hate ale, it makes me vomit. It would have been a pain to push back through the crowd to correct his blunder. So, the service is disappointing and the bartenders cannot tell ale from hard cider. Pity. I don't see any reason to go back, for food or other visits, if they cannot even get a simple drink order correct.",

We thought this was going to be a fun, new place to take him for his birthday dinner.After standing by the door for about 15 minutes because there was no \"seat yourself\" sign and no one was by the little desk, we finally went into the restaurant and realized it was seat yourself, although it was a Saturday night and with 6 people it was petty hard to find a spot. Our waitress was just the worst, and she never told us her name so I can't even mention it. She came to our table TWICE, once to get our orders and once to give us the bill (after we had to track her down to ask for it). When the other workers brought the food out they brought them out at different times and my sister's boyfriend never even got his. After having to track down random workers to get the food (it ended up being wrong anyways!) and to get sour cream, SILVERWARE and other things we were all just laughing at how bad our waitress was. We never got any re-fills on our drinks and when asking how much the vodka sprite was no one could even tell us. Overall this place was super disappointing and we all couldn't wait to leave.",

Halfway through the game our waitress comes over to tell us that they can no longer serve alcohol because their liquor license expired. She told us we could finish our drinks that we had already purchased, but she couldn't serve any more. She suggested we come back on Monday...it was Saturday night.  I am not sure how a situation like this happens.  If your main business is beer, wouldn't that be something you would be aware of? Moreover, how does the license expire at exactly 9:15pm? This was my first experience here, and while I would consider coming again, it wouldn't be my first choice.",

It was awkward because there wasn't a waiting list when we came, it was still \"seat yourself\" so when a table cleared up we tried to sit down but a server told us it was already \"claimed\" and then suddenly there was a waiting list. Why not just have a waiting list and a host at all times? Seating yourself doesn't really make sense in a restaurant this big.I understand this is a new place, but the servers and bartenders seemed to have little knowledge of the menu. My mom ordered wine 3 times, each time it came more than 10 minutes after she ordered it and the wrong wine was given to her... The third time the correct wine finally arrived (after she changed her order to an easier, more recognizable wine) but by then we had finished our meal and were ready for the check...The food is pretty unimpressive as well. The \"salad\" my sister got was just lettuce with a few nuts tossed on top of it. The nacho appetizer, on the other hand, was delicious.The bar and atmosphere of the place has so much potential, and it's a great location, but the service and food were simply a let down.",

It's big enough that you don't feel bad taking up a table for a whole game and the servers are totally cool with you staying until the end of the game (we continue to buy drinks after we eat, so that probably helps).The decor is really nice and it's a very comfortable restaurant.  My concern is that it is SO big I'm not sure if they'll be able to stay in business because besides it being a really good place to watch a game, the food is just okay.I've had the Orange and Brew Beef sandwich (just ok) and the Buffalo Chicken Wrap (good- I'll probably get this again).  Both came with the crinkle cut fries that another reviewer wrote about (probably were frozen, but I enjoyed them).  My husband had the pizza (just ok) and the BLT (just ok).  So, out of the four things we've tried, we'd probably only order one of them again.  Not great.Regarding the beer selection- yeah, it's not that exciting, but I think the name \"Orange and Brew\" is more of a tribute to the Illini than it is a reference to their beer selection.I would love to see this place re-vamp their menu to be a little more interesting and maybe not so big- maybe pick a theme?  I think they're going to have trouble staying in business if they don't.",

                "review": "While I'm tempted to give a 1-star review for the experience, I would bubble it up to a 2-star based on the atmosphere.  The restaurant is deceivingly large and nicely decorated, with adequate parking, a good sports bar feel, clean, and not overly loud.  Now, the volume may have had something to do with the fact that there were only 3-4 tables and about 4 people at the bar, but nonetheless it was a comfortable volume. Unlike the situation mentioned from an earlier reviewer, there was a prominently placed 'seat yourself' sign at the entrance.  There was very few people at tables, so we sat near the bar.  It was a weeknight but a home basketball game but there was no discernible pre-game crowd.There appeared to be 3 bartenders working and a significant number of waitstaff; about one for every 2 people in the restaurant.  Our waitress introduced herself promptly and took drink orders.  Despite there only being four of us and being seated literally less than 10' from the bar, it took about 10 minutes to get an iced tea and 2 beers.  As noted, for a restaurant with \"Brew\" in the name, the beer selection is poor.  Upon taking our orders, waitstaff disappeared to parts unknown, only to be seen fleetingly like timid woodland creatures, and we were forced to resort to a combination of primitive hand signals, napkin semaphore, and pointed looking around to signal our desire for service.Meals arrived after about 20 minutes less one salad, to which the waitress commented \"Oh yeah, that's weird.  Do you still want it?\"  Beverage refill and reorder took an additional 10 minutes.  One of the party was having wings and we requested a couple additional napkins, which she brought after being reminded once 7 minutes later.  Burger was mediocre, smallish, and dramatically overcooked.  Wings were small and undersauced but had decent flavor.  Pub chips were soggy and so oversalted that they were nearly inedible.  Quality of food was somewhere south of Buffalo Wild Wings.Overall, terrible service which seemed more like an honest cluelessness about what services a waitstaff should be providing, mediocre food, poor beer list, but a cool area.  With all of the other options within a couple of miles, if there is not an immediate improvement in service level, quality of food, and beer list i can't see this place lasting.",

The beers they do have are quite good and they have decent week-day specials but it still leaves you wanting more.Service has been hit or miss. I have had one GREAT server and a handful of not-so-good ones who didn't know the menu.The best thing Orange and Brew has going for it is its setting. Their space is beautiful with incredible TV placement (and lots of them) to ensure you will always be able to see the game. They have an awesome space that you can rent out with pool tables, a lounge area, and foozball. If you are looking for a solid, new place to go to watch a game or have a dinner with friends, Orange and Brew is for you but I would encourage you not to have extravagant expectations.",

The chips are the crunchy homemade style which I would prefer over greasy lays with my 10.00 meal.  My daughter got Mac and cheese which looked like kraft...but 99% of restaurants serve that kind on their kid menu, so that didn't bother me and she was satisfied.  The bar manager did come over and check on us which was nice.  Overall I would say I enjoyed my visit, and would definitely go back again.

                "review": "The building is lovely.  The remodel after Buttita's is as good as one can do when turning a lovely restaurant into a sports bar-style restaurant (though why one would want to do that is beyond me).  And that's where the good stuff stops.In short, the service and all things related to it were glacially slow; the food, when it arrived, was mediocre at best -- and missing key elements (one whole order, and other parts).  This restaurant cannot possibly last if they don't figure out how to greet and serve customers, or get the food that was ordered actually to the tables.The full story.Upon arrival, we found a vacant hostess stand, then a long walk down the hall to the dining room along which we saw no one who works there.  Luckily, we ran into friends who assured us that we could seat ourselves.After waiting at our table for some 15 minutes, we used a bit of self-help, and accosted a waitress to ask for some menus.  After another 5-7 minutes another waitress finally showed up with menus and silverware. She did not offer water, or to bring us a drink of any sort - just plopped the menus down and disappeared.Quite some time later, our waitress arrived, apologetically, and took our order.  We ordered an appetizer (cheese fries), and three meals: 1 burger (would have been on wheat bread but despite the menu, they had none), one 1/2 ribeye (which the menu says was supposed to be thick, but which was certainly not), that should have come with some interesting sounding twice baked potato casserole, and one individual pizza.  My daughter ordered a diet, I ordered water, and my husband ordered a beer.The water and diet only took about 7 minutes to arrive.The appetizer might have arrived after another 10, but the food runner carrying the plate of cheese fries tried to deliver them to another table. Having learned he had the wrong table, the lad just took them back to the kitchen.Eventually, the cheese fries arrived.  They weren't as hot as one would like, and for the price, there should have been a LOT more cheese.  The fries were no better than I could make using frozen crinkle fries from the grocery.Within 3 minutes of the appetizer's tardy arrival, some of our food arrived.The burger (but not the beer), and my steak with vegetable, but no potato casserole, and no pizza.The waitress arrived, and asked if everything was there, we told her \"no\", and pointed out that we were missing the beer, the potatoes and the pizza.  Ten minutes later the beer arrived.My husband then went up to the window where the pizza would have been put up for a food runner -- no pizza had been ordered.So. The steak was fatty, but moderately tasty, if only tepid.  The broccoli was cold, the burger was not as good as you can get at, say Hardee's (despite costing twice as much). We never did get the pizza.  Or the potatoes.  I DID offer to come in as a consulting manager to help them teach the staff how to actually wait tables......",

Who says you can't get decent shrimp in the Midwest?  My mom does - she's from the Philippines and hasn't been here since 1975 - I'm bringing her when she comes next June for my wedding. Oh and about her - she's a serious wine snob. Guess what? They serve Decoy wine - one of the best wineries from Sonoma. Didn't want my positive review for server Jessie to get lost - she was very kid friendly and efficient. Manager Derrick and staff are young, friendly, and motivated to make this place the best sports bar in south central.  They tell me to come back for the thin crust stone baked pizza. I certainly will.",

                "review": "We went there on 12/7, which I'm assuming was their first Saturday open. It was definitely not a good experience. There was no one at the front to tell you to seat yourself or not. We walked in at 7pm and the place was pretty busy. We left at 9pm after finishing our food and paying. It took 2 hours from start to finish just to get a meal. Luckily we weren't in a hurry. The only good points are the building is very nice and there are a lot of TVs. The bad- We requested 3 times to have the TV changed to a game we wanted to watch. 3 different people said OK, and it was never changed. When we were ordering, I asked the waitress if the rib eye sandwich was an actual steak, or shaved. She said she didn't know and instead of asking someone else, she just said she wasn't sure and starred at me. It was very uncomfortable. I was disappointed and got a burger instead. We had a 30 minute lapse where we needed a beer and no one ever came. Finally we went up to the bar and got it ourselves. They never brought out my buddy's salad. The burger was plain and way overcooked. I ordered a side of creole coleslaw which was just normal slaw. My advice- It's the little things they need to get right. Add some seasoning to your burgers and cook them correctly. Put a sign up that says seat yourself. Train waitresses to be professional. Get more staff because an hour and fifteen minute ticket time is just comical. Get more beers on tap, and include a beer menu with the food menu (it takes 30 seconds to drop one in each menu, don't be lazy). Finally, pay attention to details with peoples' food orders. It's bad when every review mentions not getting something they ordered or a mistake in the order.A guy, who I think is the owner, was walking around and asking people if they needed anything, which is good. I'm hoping he reads this and takes note because I'd like to go back due to the atmosphere and location, but I might wait a month or 2 for better service and food.EDIT*** I went back in early February, approximately 2 months after opening and my first experience. The service was A LOT better. I got the Pizza and it was pretty good. The beers kept coming. 4 beers + Pizza was around $22+tip.I can see myself going here again now...",

But, the food is terrible, and unfortunately, I doubt I will ever go back. The staff is friendly, and I really want them to succeed, but I think the writing is already on the wall.  If they don't fix the food, it's going to fail.First off, it is more of a restaurant atmosphere than a \"Saloon\", as suggested by their logo.  I went for lunch, and there was quiet music in the background, and everything was spotless.  Don't expect it to be a raucous bar.  I'm not really sure what it will be like inside on game days.Second, even though the name says \"brew\", this place specializes far more in wine than in beer.  It's not even on the menu!  They had 5-6 domestic beers on tap, but nothing that stands out.Unfortunately, the real killer here is the food and the prices.  The fries are crinkle-cut frozen fries (unacceptable), and it costs $1.75 to add them on to a burger.  A burger without fries shouldn't be more than $5, but it's $7.50 here, and it's not even that large.  The only good thing to say about the burger is that you can customize it more than almost any other place.  They had probably 6 types of cheese, 6 types of rolls, lots of toppings, and sauces.  Unfortunately, the burger itself was terrible (probably frozen meat).A friend got a pizza, and the spices and toppings on the pizza were good.  But, I'm pretty sure the pizza dough was precooked a different day, and then just pulled out of the freezer.  It was tough, and mediocre.I really hope that the owner sees this and fixes the food issues.  If so, I'll be back.  But, as it stands now, this place is doomed to failure.EDIT 3/13/2014:I'm updating the review today, since I went back for dinner.It seems the frozen fries are still there, but the dinner food seems quite good.  I got the thick cut ribeye, rare, and it was genuinely cut thick, priced very well, and extremely tasty.  My fiance ordered one of the overpriced burgers plus fries.  The fries were still not good, but for some reason, she wasn't charged for them. The menu says they cost extra ($1.75, I think), but I'm wondering if they just include them for free now.  If they are included, then the burger is not really overpriced.  The burger was much better this time, and the amount of customization allowed is really fantastic.  The decor is still great, the place is very clean, and we had good service.  Considering all of this, I feel that I should raise my review to at least 3 stars.  I've decided to go to 4, since I feel bad about the earlier negative review.",

By the time my wife and I got there (a little late due to rain), the others were already seated and had ordered some appetizers -- chips & salsa and traditional guacamole -- which were quite good. We had a smattering of margaritas, tequila flights, beer and the Ladies Best Friend, which my wife really enjoyed. The drinks were outstanding.We were initially seated inside, but chose to switch to outside once the rain had completely passed and the tables and chairs were wiped dry. Five people had some sort of taco meal and I had steak Mesquite Fajitas. Everyone seemed to enjoy the tacos. The fajitas were not sizzling as one would normally expect. They were just okay.Service at Wedge was exceptional! Although the interior was already crowded, our waitress was attentive inside and remained so once we moved outside.I had not been particularly tempted to go to Wedge since tequila has traditionally upset my stomach. However, I did try some habanero tequila, which was very good -- with no bad effects!We were celebrating a birthday and the birthday girl got a free tequila shot after dinner. Not bad.All in all, we had a delightful evening and will surely return -- perhaps to try one of the many different dinner specials that Wedge has throughout the week.",

The pickled vegetables I think I liked the idea more than the executable. Rice was bland. My dinner companion said his salad was just OK and didn't even bother to finish his margarita. The potato wedge appetizer was good and the aioli was nicely spicy.All in all, it was just ok. I'd probably go back, but I'm not in any rush.",

A U shaped bar, with a few high top tables, and a bit more private booths.  No TV's at the bar, which is saying something in this town.  I really like the vibe here.  Relaxed and cozy during off hours.  Though this small spot gets packed during the weekend.  Though the bartenders and waitresses do their best, and the food always seems to come out quick.My family and I found a seat in one of the booths.  A smaller menu, with a few aps, tacos, and a few entrees.  You can mix and match 5 tacos for $15.  I love the Pastor, and Chorizo tacos.  The Pastor has a great mix of fruity sweetness and heat.  The Chorizo has a really good kick.  Fresh as can be guacamole, and the black beans are so flavorful.  Certainly not your typical mushy flavorless mass of beans at most mediocre Tex-Mex places.The bar is well stocked.  I am not a Tequila guy at all, but the Margaritas here are top notch.  They make some really good cocktails with the several house infused Tequilas and a huge selection to choose from.Tasty food that is more than the typical Tex-Mex joint, good bar, good service, and an all around fun place for a meal and a few drinks in this wonderful, but small downtown.",

Unfortunately, things were even more disorganized than the last time. The host was very friendly and attentive, letting us know he would be able to seat us soon and that we can hang out at the bar until the table was ready. The fact that we were greeted by a host was a great improvement for me because last time, I felt the confusion with seating and lack of a seating host/hostess was a major problem. When we approached the bar, the bartender brought one of us a drink right away while the rest of us needed some time to look at the drink menu. This is when the chaos ensued. A bunch of servers needed drinks for their tables and pretty soon, the lone bartender was caught up mixing margarita after margarita which all must be made to order. Then, large groups of people decided to also hang out at the bar while they waited for seating. At this point, a kind bus boy took pity on us and decided to put our drink orders in but he was unable to use the register, leading to a long line of customers who received drinks but hadn't paid. Our table actually became ready before we could pay for our drinks! We had to wait to pay before being seated. I was glad, once being seated to be out of the chaos of the bar. However, our server was just as disorganized when he forgot to bring us water after my boyfriend asked for it on 3 occasions. We didn't get water until we were almost done with our entrees! After all that, the food was pretty good. I had a chili relleno taco which was crazy! and surprisingly delicious! But unfortunately a lot of it was a little bland. Maybe the disorganized service put a bad taste in my mouth.",

One does not forget that traffic is nearby due to the frequent noise and the persistent smell of exhaust.However, the drinks are divine (lots of margaritas from which to choose) and apps are varied and pleasing. If the server warns that a dish is spicy, he/she is not messing around. I absolutely love spicy food, and I was not disappointed. Although I miss the old Carmen's restaurant at this same location, Wedge seems like a pretty good addition to downtown Champaign.",

I would not recommend this restaurant for a group outing as there are very few tables that seat over 4 people. I would recommend (the) Wedge for a date, however! It is cozy and the atmosphere is lively. Servers were attentive and didn't mind our party being laid back about ordering. I tried a delicious aejo, the guacamole, and a pastor taco. The drinks are reasonably priced for the location and atmosphere, and the bartenders/waitstaff are educated about the drink menu. The guacamole comes in a very small portion but it was quite good (I found the chips to be greasy though). The tacos were tasty.. perhaps not as authentic as el charro or maize but decently priced at $3 for what you get (quite a filling portion and the taco was piled with lots of extras, including roasted pineapple and chile de arbol salsa--yum!). I'm not sure that I will be back immediately but it's a worthwhile spot to check out if you want something a little different for the area.",

The cocktails were expensive, weak and heavily watered down with soggy ice. Sangria was barely a few sips of wine in a huge glass full of watery ice. Menus were dirty and table was sticky. No free chips and salsa so don't come here expecting any, and the $6 order of chips and guacamole is not large enough to be shared. The patio was busy but the inside of the restaurant was about 1/3 capacity and service was very slow. Everyone seemed concerned with what was going on outside and not inside. The food was lukewarm when it arrived. The rice was swollen and overcooked. Small spoonful of black refried beans. Flavor of everything was okay but nothing special.The carnitas were shredded pork fried on an oily flat top and not large cubes of tender fried pork like every other Mexican restaurant. Portions were smaller and less tasty than prices would indicate. My dates fried egg chorizo tacos were also delivered without eggs and then we were over billed, causing us to hang around even longer an be late to our show. Total disaster of a dinner. We had heard bad things from friends but decided to try Wedge for ourselves and we regretted the mistake immediately. Our table of 4 spent ~$100 and felt ripped off.",

I recommend getting the side of rice and beans because they are both delicious.

The bar tenders are cute and friendly with their own edgy styles. The wait staff, young and professional with good knowledge of menu items. I decided to give this place a try after reading reviews on it. It was a grey cloudy day and it had just finished raining, as cute as it looked, outside seating was out of the question. But just to let you know, it is available. It is a seat yourself place, So I plopped at the bar, quickly greeted and met with a drink menu. By the by, all cocktails are only $6 on hump day..  I love me some margaritas. The spicy pineapple margarita was my choice tonight and I had that to enjoy while looking over the menu. Finally decided to have the steak torta, carnitas taco, chips and ranchero guacamole. There was no stagnant wait time to place my order as the bartender was very attentive despite the semi crowded bar. It was about give minutes later, boom, my chips come out. The chips are a crunchy kind of good. There are three kinds of guacamole in which I ordered the chunky spicy kind. It was a perfect accompaniment with my drink and anticipation for my meal. Before I can get halfway down my drink and just as I got over the chips, tada... Here comes my food. The timing couldn't be any more spot on. The steak torta was very tasty. It was seasoned and moist with the toasted bread just crisp. The sandwich was pretty darn good. On the plate were also potato wedges that came with aioli dip. Without the dip, the wedges were.. meh. It's all about that dip. Done with my first drink, I gave the bar tender a nod and boom another one came. Completed my steak, on to my taco. The carnitas or pork, was a bit dry and it was just ok. Following the steak, it wasn't great. Finished it anyway, dipped it in the guac and poured salsa on it. That did the trick. Munched on the chips some more as I wrote this review. The environment is clean, friendly and inviting. The wait staff is awesome. The food is great. And the prices are reasonable. The music is trendy and relatively current. I would come back here again for sure. The restroom , sit or squat.   I give it a sit!",

I am so sorry I will have the GM call you back.\" I did not think anything of it at the time because I understand it could be anything.)I called, with no mean intentions, to inform them that I, as well as the doctor I went to see at Carle Clinic, were 95% positive that Wedge was the source of this foodborne illness, and the doctor assured me it was NOT the flu.  Wedge did not return my 3 calls until 3 days later, and the GM's response was that \"I'm pretty confident we are not the source. There is a bad flu going around.\" Thanks for the call.

Our server was very friendly and attentive; she provided recommendations for drinks and food and she didn't rush us out after finishing our meal which I really appreciated, especially with it being such a pleasant summer night to sit outside.  We both went with the taco dinner-I chose 1 fish taco and 1 of their calabacitas (zucchini blossoms, yum!) tacos, while my friend went with 2 chicken tacos.  We also both got one of their lime margaritas.  The dinner came with refried beans, rice, and some pickled veggies too!  All in all, we were both pleased with our food!  The calabacitas taco was my favorite hands-down, but the fish taco was pretty yummy too.  I would definitely recommend Wedge as a great spot to sit outside, catch up with friends, and enjoy some Mexican food in downtown Champaign for a fairly reasonable price.",

I have been wanting to try it after hearing about all the different drinks and tequilas they had, but all that waiting was in vain. First off, I made a reservation, but was placed under a tent in  a parking lot on a 45 degree evening. It was warm when we first walked in, but were placed in the back where there were no heater lamps and the temperature was unbearable. We asked to be moved to a table closer to the one functioning heater lamp and were accommodated by the staff (although, in hindsight I wish we wouldn't have been so we would have gotten out then). After being comfortable for about ten minutes the lamp was moved to the back so we were freezing again, but by that point we were ready to leave. We ordered apps to start and got salsa and the ranchero guac. The salsa was good, but the guac was TERRIBLE. it was as cold as the wind blowing under the tent and despite the menu listing it as guacamole with pico de gallo and queso, there was no cheese visible or to taste and as many chunks of tomato and onion as corn (which coincidentally is not supposed to be in this version of guacamole). This led us to believe that they just made one large batch that they could serve as any of the three sub par renditions and stored it in a freezer all day. My drink (the diablo) was satisfactory. My boyfriend ordered the traditional margarita that included patron, patron citronage, orange liqueur and agave nectar. It tasted awful and they upcharged 50 cents for his request of Don Julio Blanco, which is acceptable, but then he was randomly charge $3 for Grand Marnier out of the blue. At that point it wasn't even worth dealing with so we paid and left. Their menu looks pretty good until you start tasting the food, but an individual taco is $3 and a platter of 5 tacos is $15...not a mathematician but that's not really a deal...actually it's not a deal at all. BOTTOM LINE: just don't do it. The food is wanna be upscale but is a flat out miss. The drinks are interesting, but seem to be a crapshoot depending on the specific cocktail.",

But I will say that their standard lime margarita, which I judge all tequila bars/ Mexican restaurants against, was pretty good. Just too bad they use orange juice in the mix.

The place is also a bit tiny, and if you've got a group larger than four, good luck getting seats.Why four stars, then? Because this place has a ton of tequila, and a lot of really good choices. I was a huge fan of the tequila flights (I sprung for a Reposado flight my first time there) and they've got a bar full of bottles you can't get anywhere else. I've found it annoying that I can't get a plain old margarita in the past, and then I remember that I can get a glass of Riazul for $6 and I shut right up. If you're looking to do tequila shots with the limes and the salt and the children in Campustown, this isn't going to do much for you. But if you're looking for a nice place to sit back and enjoy tasting a spirit that people normally don't sip, it's awesome.",

Was this worth a \"date night\" with my husband ? Not really. When you have to pay for a baby-sitter a date night better be worth it! Wedge was more miss than hit for us, and while it wasn't terrible, it just isn't worth a repeat for us, especially since we can't really come here with our son - too bar-like b/c most of the tables have high bar stools. There are better (casual and pricy) places for a date in C-U. Pros:The server was great! Mixed up a fancy N/A juice for me since I'm pregnant. The fish tacos- very good- loved the sauce especially. But go easy on the cabbage!The steak tacos w/ poblano - good.Beer prices were reasonable.Meh: Tacos al Pastor - decent, but not worth a repeat visit, IMO. Guacamole - decent flavor- a bit too acidic, not enough salt.Cons: Chips and salsa are NOT free - it's $3 for an order!Beans - fresh out of a.... Can. So easy to make good beans, no excuses here.Guacamole price was high compared to other places around town (and yes, I know the cost of an avocado $0.90-1.79/each- esp owning the El Toros in town, I'm sure the owners get them cheaper than we can at Meijer. Price was $6 for a small portion that was *maybe*a single avocado. Seated right by the door - kept getting interrupted so servers could get liquor out, new patrons walking in - it was freezing! Forget a  nice date - we were cold and felt *very* rushed. If you want to get drinks and linger, or dessert, sit in the back. If you want a Jimmy Johns \"Freaky Fast\" experience, sit in the front. Carnitas taco - absolutely disgusting. It tasted like the meat was rotten. The nuts were whole and just didn't work  - would be better chopped up, but they dont' really add to the taco. This actually made me feel sick. My husband agreed.",

A group of friends and I chose to sit inside because outside was super crowded. Our server came to us, and asked us our drink order. She would not let my friend order a virgin drink, because \"sweetheart it tastes bad.\" My friend even said I do it all the time ( and we have done it before at wedge), and she still just shook her head no. Ok fine, so we stuck to water. Then it came time to put in our food order and all six of us ordered, and I ordered nachos. Ten minutes later our food comes, and one friend gets soup and I get tacos. I practically have to chase her down to tell her that no one ordered soup and I ordered nachos. She snatches away the tacos and soup and tells me \"sweetheart it will be a few minutes.\" I tell my friends to start eating, and 15 minutes later she comes back with ice cold nachos. Plops that down and walks away. It took you 25 minutes to get me nachos, but why were they cold?! On numerous occasions our server was just standing at the bar area, not doing her job! There were maybe 3 tables inside that needed service and she was exclusively an indoor server! Our water glasses were empty for almost 15 minutes before my friend kindly asked for a refill, and she looked at us silently, walked away, came back with a water carafe slammed that onto the table and walked away. Sweetheart, you don't go into the customer service business if you do not know how to provide even adequate customer service. Our server was just very rude, inattentive, and gave us major attitude for absolutely no reason. Another example of her incompetency, one friend asked for no sour cream with her quesadilla, our server answered with major attitude: \"you know it comes in the middle right.\" Meaning the middle of the plate, and so you can't just write no sour cream on your note pad?! My friend said I know, but the server just stared at her so when the time came there was sour cream on her plate. The best part of this whole experience was at the end our server was suddenly sappy sweet and told what a pleasure it was to serve us--ummm no you sucked. And your nasty niceness at the end did not help your tips, sweetheart.",

The only thing that would have made it better is a skirt of lime.The chips and salsa are also very good and the sangria is some of the best I've ever had, and I make my own a lot of the time. The tacos where all very tasty and fresh and I even ate the black beans, which I usually stay away from, but decided to try them and was glad I did. The only bad part of the meal was the rice. Very bland and almost remained me of converted rice, oh well.The service was excellent and very cute, I might add. I will defiantly be going back next time I am in town.",

Our server, no doubt, was fabulous, but the food was completely subpar, especially when you have places like Maize, El Toro, or even Q'doba who seem to have gotten it right. Our guacamole left much to be desired. I make guacamole all the time, but this had a taste that it had been left in the fridge for a day or two, and was not a bright green color that would have indicated freshness. It was extremely acidic, but perhaps that was so you didn't realize the avocado was not fresh? The chips that supplied the guac were extremely flimsy, and not designed to be any kind of dipping chip, especially not with something as heavy as the guac. We did not ask for seconds.The drinks were strong but it felt and tasted like cheap tequila. It didn't settle well with my friend and I. The names are cute and they sure entice you, but I'm pretty sure the chef/bartender/owner has had no real experience with amazing drinks.The menu is surprisingly small, and they do tacos as basically their center focus, although there are some other things on the menu. I wasn't in a taco mood so I ordered the carne asada, and my friend the pork dish. The pork was good, the carne asada had a decent flavor, and the food came out fast. However, these plates were not worth $13. This same meal at El Toro or even at Maize would be cheaper and fresher. In summary, we were disappointed that we started our evening there, and even more disappointed when we left and went to Big Grove Tavern because for $13, they were serving roasted chicken and vegetables, something you know was high quality based on where they get their ingredients and the overall knowledge that their chef knows what they are doing. We give Wedge a year before it closes. Unless of course someone is brought in to give the menu and the chef a revamp so that people want to come back.",

For snacks got the potato wedges with aioli and a veggie quesidilla.  Both were spiced but more savory not overwhelmingly hot.   Were a few pangs of infant restaurant problems (credit card machine operation was spotty).  All in all pleasant place for a drink and food was interesting.  It is quite small so if it gets popular, it might be a hard table.",

They serve it really neat and pretty compared to a regular Mexican place. I was so disappointed you had to pay for chips and salsa :( For the size I think it's a little bit overpriced - although it is understandable due to the location. The drinks? For a tequila bar I think the drink menu is underwhelming. I've tried the sparkling pomegranate and perfect patron margaritas - they're ok. I've had better and cheaper margaritas before.The nice thing is they have outside seating in the summer!",

Their fajitas, though, seemed old (not even sizzling when brought out, although still hot-ish). The meat was about 3/4 fat, instead of meat, so eating the fajita tacos was more of a task than enjoying a meal since I had to pull out the fat. I think if I go back, I'll definitely stick to the tacos. Tried the pineapple and mango jalapeno margaritas...the mango is definitely more spicy than the pineapple. Both were decent, though.---the Monday margarita flight is amazing!! Also, the Monday taco special is great. I'd definitely recommend getting tacos when you come here, but steer clear of the steak! The blood orange margarita is now a favorite.",

                "review": "I felt like I was back in downtown Austin, TX or dining off of Randolph Street in Chicago, IL. This restaurant brings major city dining, service and ambiance to a small college town. Ambiance - The entire experience was spot on. From the moment we walked in, we were pleasantly surprised by the attention to decor details. Backlit stained glass windows, wine bar with lounge, reclaimed wood on walls, \"edison\" bulb lighting, short mason jars with candles on tables. It felt great being in the space. Getting a table - The hostess was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. Took down our number to call us when the table was ready. Said it would take 30-40 minutes, told us the group sizes ahead of us. 40 minutes later phone rang and our table was ready. We arrived around 7 - 7:30pm. They were getting ready to do their second seating. If you aren't going to arrive by 6, consider arriving between 7:30 - 8:30pm as things appeared to clear out a bit by then. Seating - We sat in a booth, which I love doing so I can sit next to my husband. There are a limited QTY of booths, thus if this is your preference you should consider putting in that request with a hostess early. If weather is nice, they have a lot of outdoor tables on Neil Street. Bonus - when Cowboy Monkey has bands playing (around the corner), you can get music for free!Service - I don't know if all waiters that work here are as talented and knowledgeable as ours, but as a previous server at a high-end restaurant while in college - wow! He was attentive, well-spoken, knew the menu inside and out (props to the chef for letting your servers try everything - it makes a big difference), and was super knowledgeable about wines (we are not). My husband had ordered a malbec, enjoyed it, and put in an order for another. The server told him he should really try another one by the glass and that he'd like it more -- which he did and was pleasantly surprised. Food - We were so pleased by our meal. For a starter, we ordered 12 month manchego cheese with 15 month-aged jamon (ham). It comes out on a butchers block serving tray with an assortment of warm and soft bread slices, date chutney, several hot peppers and an olive tapenade. Yum! We then put in an order for foccacia bread with chicken sausage on top and fennel. It's perfectly bite-sized sliced and great for sharing. For entries, we ordered shrimp with pork belly over grits. The second entre was scallops with crispy proscuito over perfectly tender potatoes. Management - The chef circled around to tables twice to visit personally with everyone. He was very gracious and attentive. Nice gesture!Props - It is also worth noting, they've only been open 2 weeks! The amount of work it requires to have a beautiful space, menu hammered out, well-trained and lovely staff and to provide a great dining experience so soon after opening is impressive. We were truly delighted with our meal and surprised / thankful to have a restaurant of this nature in Champaign!  Final Tips: 1. Put in your name and if it is crowded, go next door to Blind Pig Brewery or Quality for a pint. 2. Request a booth as they are more private against the walls. 3. Focaccia bread dishes are great for sharing. 4. Entres run around $18-$25. Plenty of options for wine by the glass and tapas too. 5. Don't be in a  rush. This is not churn tables out kind of restaurant. It is slower-paced and a relaxing atmosphere.",

Jen our waitress was fine, the issue was the very slow service both getting our drinks and our entrees. It was a nice night and the outdoor seating was very full and that was their excuse for the slow service. If that is the case then they need to add a bartender and another sous chef to handle the volume. We were inside and it was only about half full so they will be in real trouble if they pack the house.",

I'm so pleased that I got the opportunity to visit last night.  The second we walked in, I loved the ambiance.  They had a little live music in the bar area that drifted into the dining room--so it wasn't too loud to talk and was just the perfect backdrop to a fun evening with a friend.  The pressed tin ceilings made the space feel warm and the eclectic art was well lit and positioned to draw interest.  But enough about the building--let's get down to brass tacks and talk about food and wine.You want an authentic local farm-to-table concept?  Go no further.  V. Picasso partners locally with Willow Creek Farm in Urbana and features Prairie Fruits Farms cheese on its menu as well.  They supplement with wonderful food items from around the world--they know an insane amount of information about where EXACTLY each food item is sourced and can tell you what makes it distinctive.  (Case in point:  One of their specials last night was a smoked venison osso buco that was described in incredible detail.  This place is serious about what they serve.)VPicasso has an amazing wine list with eclectic selections around the world.  They also offer 'wine on tap' which sounds interesting.  Our awesome waiter, Trent, suggested a wonderful Montepulciano D'Abruzzo that was light and not super acidic.  It's totally a new fave.Although the specials sounded AMAZING (osso buco?  you truly know the way to my heart, chef...) and the entrees looked fabulous (lobster ravioli? black cod? lamb shank?  risotto?) we weren't particularly hungry and wanted to just enjoy some of the wonderful cheese they offered.  (Major props to both the Manchego and the tangy Bohemian Blue)  The cheese board is served with fabulous honey from the farm, a yummy olive tapenade that was so good I thought we were going to get into a duel with our forks over it, and a jam in addition to lovely bread.  We ordered the roasted beet and arugula salad that had a perfect dressing on it that paired perfectly with the cheese we were eating (who knew!) and the shrimp toast.  It was fantastic.  Even though we were kinda full, it was too hard to resist the interesting desserts.  We landed on the chai funnel cake.  Seriously good.And call me crazy, but half of what makes or breaks a restaurant for me is service.  The staff was super friendly and easy-going and tremendously knowledgeable and professional.  I'm kind of a service snob--there are servers who do the job for the tips and there are servers who have restaurant in their blood and are actually concerned about the experience their guests have.  Chef Adam hires VERY well.So all in all, I'm more than pleased.  Don't you love Champaign?  Where else can you have all of this in the heart of your town?",

We were running late (3 kids to grandmas is never easy), the plan was to have a glass of wine or two before dinner and to take advantage of the happy hour special.  My wife sat down at the bar at 5:57pm (3 minutes left of happy hour) and ordered us each a glass.  The bartender said he would give her one... like he was doing her a favor. She was actually there earlier and was waiting on him.  He finally obliged and gave her and I one.  Later when we ordered our second glass with dinner it had 25% more wine in the glass.  So he gave us 3/4 of a pour.It was our 10 year anniversary and when they called to confirm earlier that day they said \"Is it true you will be celebrating your 10 year anniversary with us?, we have something really nice for you\".  Not once was it mentioned that it was our anniversary.  As we left the restaurant the hostess finally said happy anniversary.  I wasn't expecting much but dont call me and say you have something special for me and then just give me crappy service. Like I said, the place is nice. Just avoid the bar and hope for good service.",

Shrimp toast was just ok. My husband did not like it at all. Hence, our all hopes were on mains. Lamb shank was fine but it did not have any freshness of vegetables or salads to cut the richness of dish. On the other hand, duck had some freshness but was overcooked. Overall, it was just an ok experience. My overall ratings are below:Shrimp toast: 5/10Lamb shank: 6/10Duck: 6/10They have changed their menu since we first went there. I will only try it again if they add more seafood selection and also accompany their dishes with some salad to cleanse the palate.",

The waiter was the most friendly and helpful and conversational waitstaff I have ever encountered. And the food. Man. What a way to break from my campus habits of Chipotle and Torticas. A friend and I did two started and shared the entree and dessert. We chose the beef tartare and roasted bone marrow appetizers. It was my first time trying steak tartare and I was really pleased with it, though the potato chips that come with it to eat are a little overpowering for the tartare. The bone marrow is as rich and indulgent as you might expect, and well complemented by the toasts it comes with. Our entree was the grilled Berkshire farms pork chop and came with a side of cheesy macaroni and arugula. The pork chop was very substantial and somehow crispy, almost like it was fried. Very nicely done and the apple sauce is delicious made from local apples from Curtis Orchard.Dessert was a funnel cake drizzled with caramel and topped with whipped cream. So good! Definitely lighter than your average Funnel cake, and also super crispy and crunchy.",

We were one of two couples eating at the time In the entire restaurant, I don't see how the steak could come out over. I had the rabbit pasta dish. Although good, it was not good enough for the price and quantity given.  I asked the waiter about the size of the dish because I was very hungry. He definitely exaggerated the size by at least double. I was given an appetizer amount of food that I finished in less than 10 bites. Once our bill came I noticed we were also charged for a glass of wine that we did not order. We had no wine at all that night.I would give them some time to get settled before going back for a second time.",

I had a glass of wine and my husband skipped having anything once we had been treated as lesser customers. Sadly, the bar tender didn't seem to think we were worth much attention... maybe because we weren't dressed fancy enough. I don't know... don't judge a book by its cover. (I digress) So the wine was great and the menu looked stunning! We will be back for a real meal at some point. (Don't worry snobby bar tender... I'll dress up next time to meet you expectations and judgmental side glare.) Hopefully next time I'll find this place is with more stars... based on the look and menu, it should be! Very impressive.",

It wasn't busy at all on a Friday night around 9 and we came for small plates and drinks. I love the decor here, rustic wood meets mosaics and  stained glass with these really cool round light fixtures. I always give points to anyplace that takes time to create ambiance in our little bar town. Anyway, we had a super nice server named Ryan who suggested some good drinks. Ever since Boltini (RIP) closed, I've been searching for a good cocktail in this town. Hoping for a miracle, I tried two cocktails here. I'm happy to report the standout was the Martinez. It was flavorful without overpowering the palette with that gin tanginess. It does pack quite the wallop so make sure you're eating too. We also sampled some cheese and meats with the best being The \"Spanish\" variety: jamon Serrano and the manchego. I also tried the salmon flat bread which was red wine cured salmon with dill cream. It was perfectly light and left you with room for drinks. For a larger dining space, the noise was a low din. I'm pretty sure we were the loudest people there. This place is on the pricey side compared to the other restaurants in the area (my salmon and 2 cocktails was 25 or so) but it is well worth it. I'm looking forward to coming back on a date or just to try more cocktails!",

All were delicious and quite filling. They don't' have a children's menu so the waiter was kind enough to ask the chef to make the Croque Monsieur into just a roasted ham and gruyere sandwich for my daughter on a pretzel bun instead with fries (a side option for all sandwiches) and they were more than willing. In fact we all had a bite and loved it! It was probably the best ham sandwich that little girl had ever eaten! Haha!",

His recommendations were on point (loved the Prairie Fruit Farm Brie) and were paired well with the jams, honey (RIP the bees), and focaccia. Our meals were delicious. The linguine and clams had surprising kick to it and the squid ink pasta was so fresh! The risotto and salmon were also great choices. While the restaurant was out of all desserts, this place still gets 5 stars and I highly recommend it! Cheers!",

The outdoor seating is also very pleasant--- particularly looking down Park Avenue into West side park. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly. I've repeatedly had great experiences there.",

First the food is interesting (always one of my highest criteria).  Two of us chose the \"cured dish of the day\", fried green tomatoes, quail entree and duck entree.  There was a bit of southern Americana bent.  Of the dishes, the cured fish was a bust from my point of view.  Wonderfully cured salmon, served with paprika whole grain mustard, tapinade, moderately spicy grilled peppers and grilled baguette.  If you put it all together the salmon is lost in the mix.  Don't know what it all had to do with each other but....Fried green tomatoes were wonderful not much more to say.  The quail was stuffed with a rhubarb. The quail was nicely cooked but as a matter of personal taste didn't like the stuffing.  Duck was wonderfully cooked over a corn risotto.Wines by the glass was a high point.  A bit pricey, but they had probably 20 wines by the glass or even for small tasting pours.  Choices were interesting.  We decided for wine pairings by the glass vs a bottle and were quite happy.So I think as the restaurant matures a bit it will be well worth it.",

The vegetarian lasangia was amazing and the rizoto was also pretty awesome - but a bit too much for me... So I'm happy my dish was the lasaniga :)Our server was very attentive and helped us to a great wine selection. It's important to mention that the place is a bit pricy especially for the tiny portions you get. Our goat cheese and arugula salad appetizer was super tiny - but super super tasty. All in all it's definitely worth a try. Especily since there aren't many great restaurants in our area that take their food seriously.",

Our waiter kept the breadsticks and salad coming. Multiple orders of soup were taken. Love the extra cheese on top of anything you want. Great price- got all that food for around $60 plus tip. Our waiter was very attentive and made us laugh a few times. Even wished my dad a happy birthday because he overheard us mentioning it being his birthday lunch.Neutral: Rosemary chicken was OK. Chicken gnocchi soup could have been a bit spicier. Minestrone was OK.Take home: Kinda wish I had tipped my server more (I did a bit over 20%). He was wonderful.",

Olive Garden is number one on my list for affordable Italian without sparing the classy ambiance. The food here is wonderful - I always start by sharing the smoked mozzarella fonduta before moving on to the always flavorful minestrone soup. Whatever you order for your entree, make sure you save room for dessert - the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake is to die for!But more than the food and environment, the customer service here is what makes this Olive Garden unmatched. I have never been greeted by a more cheerful and enthusiastic wait staff; they genuinely enjoy working there and making pleasant conversation with the diners. I always tip my servers well, because they really do make us feel like part of the family!",

After sitting there for ten minutes we were led to a dinig area that was maybe 1/3 full of customers. I was a bit confused on their use of host and hostesess. There was one person taking names, another checking the names, two other standing their alternating taking the diners to their seats in the dated dining room. Christ the only reason we went to this place is because we had a gift card and I'm hoping the gift giver next year makes a better choice. So my wife ordered the fettucini alfredo with Chicken (she has a standard) and I ordered some sort of entre that appeals to men that only eat beef, toss it with some pasta and voila, Dinner!  The humorous moment was when the server asked me how I would like my braised beef done-it's braised, look it up. Anyhow the sauce with it was a cream base, had some portabella mushrooms with it and some fresh parsley (to make it appear fresh) though my entre looked like it has been sitting under the hot lights for a good 10 minutes. The salad we got was marginal (I don't get what the big deal is) and the breadsticks seemed like they'd been sitting in the basket for 10 minutes (not so hot)- While our food  wasn't absolutely horrible, I don't understand why this place is full all the time. I would love for it to be another 10 years (or more) until I eat here again....glad I wasn't paying for it!",

The complimentary and delicious bread sticks and salad always came out to our table within 5 minutes, and let's not forget these are endless!  Drinks and food came really quick, surprisingly quick actually considering the huge crowd waiting outside.  Our servers have always been attentive and friendly.Food is priced very expensive, but I think one knows that before they come here.  If you don't... well then you're in for a surprise.  Everything I've ever ordered though has been delicious and a big enough portion that I have enough for two big meals.  I don't go here all the time because of the price,  but when I do, the experience has always been great.  Let's not forget that every time I went they were offering complimentary wine, pouring us full glasses of it.  If you don't mind the wait to get seated, I definitely recommend this restaurant.",

We waited ten minutes for two glasses of sangria, when that finally arrived the waiter took our order (some couples combo that included an appetizer). The the size of my drink was quite small so I finished it rather quickly and waited for our server to have another ten minute personal conversation with the table next to ours meanwhile we were still waiting for our breadsticks and salad... After about ten more minutes the waiter showed up with the breadsticks and salad. At that very same time our main entree came out. We sent it back since we had not had our salad or even our appetizers yet. I then ordered another drink. Ten minutes go by while we gnawed on old cold breadsticks and soggy salad still waiting on my drink and our appetizers while intently listening to our waiter recall his hometown antics with the table next to us. Finally the drink and appetizers arrive after about five more minutes, shouldn't have waited for it though The ravioli was cold and chewy, I mean cowhide chewy... Then our main course comes back out. Back out as in from the heat lamp. One bite in we realized the cheese had separated and it was barely warm. Needless to say after a small chat with the manager explaining how I would not return due to poor food and even worse service we left without being charged. In the end, save your time, save your money, and do not eat here, there are much better establishments in champaign.",

We decided to take a quick dinner here and was hoping for a solid Italian dinner. Alas not so good. I ordered the steak medallion Gorgonzola fettuccine alfredo. While waiting for dinner, we had the unlimited breadsticks which were good along with the soup. Somehow my two bowls of soup came out lukewarm which was quite disappointing. The dinner that I had ordered had overcooked fettuccine alfredo with 4 piece of \"steak medallion\". Unfortunately, not a good cut of beef as they were tough and chewy. Even though I had ordered it medium rare, the steak was close to medium to well. Even before we finished eating the waiter asked if we would like dessert and promptly threw down the check when we said no. Overall I will have to pass from eating here again.Pro: unlimited soup/breadsticks or salad if you wantCons: overcooked pasta, the quality of the meat for the dish was not goodHidden gem:Check sunday paper for coupons. Unlimited soup and breadstick. Sign up online for the e-club for a free appetizer with the purchase of 2 entrees.",

When my meal had a salad and my friend's didn't he brought two salad bowls so she could \"steal\" some salad, too. The shrimp fettuccine was delicious; my friend commented that the zuppa soup had a different sausage than previously used in the past, that this time the sausage was less spicy.I ordered the long island limoncello, was good, but not what I expected.

                "review": "In General, I consider the Olive Garden chain to be one of the upper-average casual chain restaurant choices.  The Champaign Olive Garden has declined significantly within the last year.  I believe this is due to a change in management, but I am not 100% certain.  My last meal there was in November and the standards were that of poorly-run fastfood restaurant.  This is what I wrote about it at the time:\"Remember how Olive Garden used to be a 'nice' place to have a casual meal?  Even though it was a chain restaurant and you knew most of the food was heated up in a microwave, it looked like real food and it almost tasted like it had been cooked.  It seemed a little nicer than your T.G.I. Fridays and your Applebee's.  Well, it's not like that anymore.  Not the one in C-U anyway.  I don't think I will be going back there ever again.   The first thing I noticed when I walked in was that the entire place reeked like a sour towel.  Someone had obviously wiped all of the tables down with a cheap disinfectant solution that had gotten a bit... ripe.  It was disgusting.  I proceeded to the bathroom to wash my hands before my meal where I found two employees lounging about and chatting while pretending to clean the restroom.  Since they did not find it prudent to tone down their conversation whilst a guest was in their presence, I got to enjoy a pre-dinner melodrama.  Apparently an employee of the Olive Garden is trying to file a sexual harassment suit and the management had been asking both ladies if they had experienced any inappropriate behavior.  And while the accused sometimes gets a \"wild hair up their ass\" they did not consider themselves harassed.  Speaking of sex, Manuel looked FINE this morning and when he came into work they were like \"oh my GOD!\"  When I got back to my seat, our waiter (who I admit was nice and attentive) served us a sample of white zinfandel that had the distinct vinegary taste of a wine that has been left uncorked for too long.  The food, which tasted decent, no longer looks, tastes or feels like real food.  Both the dinner and dessert had an artificiality to it that resembled an expensive TV dinner.  The textures were waxy and the cheese was lardlike.  While the flavors were bold, they tasted man-made and had a processed mouth-feel.  It was to real food what Velveeta is to real cheese.  The dessert, the chocolate torte, especially had the look of something that had just been plopped out of it's microwavable container.   The vanilla sauce was practically flavorless and the torte was only heated halfway, resulting in a jello-pudding like consistency to the fudge filling.  It is also made with artificial sugar now, which adds to its alien flavor and texture.  In truth, the food quality is comparable to a fast food restaurant.  The only difference is that they offer more variety and a few more low quality ingredients per dish.I know it's just Olive Garden.  I know it's an evil chain restaurant and a glorified McDonalds.  I guess the thing is that it didn't used to be this way.  I think I've heard that they are under new management.  It used to be satisfying in a guilty pleasure flavor overload sort of way and it made you feel sort of ok about it because it deceived you into thinking it was real food.  But now it's not.  The seams are showing.  Quality of service and presentation has gone way down.  Corners are being cut and it shows.  You can tell it is just a fancier Fazoli's and it's really had to pay $25-$30 bucks a person for some sour wine and some microwaved Italian Velveeta in a place that smells like mildew.",

We waited about 15 mins just to order lemonade. By the time Meghan took our drink order, we were ready to order our appetizer. Good thing because it took 45 minutes for our smoked mozzarella to come to our table. The other guests seated around us all seemed to have better service and didnt have much of a wait. Our server ignored our requests for refills and more bread sticks and had to be reminded a couple times. Our cups sat empty for most of our meal. Not even 5 minutes after our appetizer (almost and hour into our meal), we got our entrees. We didn't have enough time for our app. I have zero complaints about our food, just the service was awful. At the end of our meal, Meghan boxed up our left overs and said she would return with a bad for our bread sticks, but she never came back.  The only thing crappier than the service was the parking lot with potholes that could swallow my Hyundai whole. We will be going back to Olive Garden, but not to this location.",

WEEEEEE!I swear, the soup/salad/breadsticks have sprinkles of crack and MSG, they're pretty addicting.  And I'm pretty sure they use one can of Morton's salt per serving bowl of salad.Tip: Make sure you ask for more salad and breadsticks as soon as you get your first batch, or the waiter will disappear until your entrees arrive.  By then, they know they got you pinned against a psychological wall, because who eats more salad with their entree?  Break past that wall of uncomfortability and continue to ask for refills until the check arrives.  Heck, ask for it after the check arrives.  It's like a glass of water - it should always be full.FYI, the sangria is f-ing expensive.

This one wasn't my choice though, and knowing how I feel about chains as well as my high standards for Italian cuisine, I bit my tongue and hoped for the best.We had to wait about 10 minutes on a Tuesday night to be seated. Apparently Olive Garden is a hot commodity in Champaign....We were seated and I was quite indecisive about what to get. I settled on a build-your-own-pasta with alfredo/cream sauce and added Italian sausage. For my choice of soup, I got the Tuscan bean, and of course the notorious breadsticks. The soup was pretty tasty, it had like beans and zucchini and onions and a bunch of other things in a tasty tomato-y broth. Not bad! The pasta I got wasn't too bad either, the noodles may have been a little overcooked but the sauce was pretty creamy. I did not like the sausage. I'm no tubular meat expert but this tasted really institutional and for the upcharge it cost to add it to my pasta, I probably should have just went meatless or ordered the chicken, like my smarter date did....The thing that really upset me about the experience though was the service. I don't remember the server's name, he was actually quite personable, but our meal felt very very rushed. Our soups came out quick which was good, but I was not even halfway done with mine before our dinners had arrived and we had to move our soups out of the way to eat our dinner. I'd consider myself a fast eater, too so this was frustrating, especially since I wanted to actually talk to my date, you know, the reason why I'm here in the first place!! This wasn't the last straw though, I was probably 75% done with my entre when the server comes up and asks if we are interested in desert. Ugh! We looked at each other and both agreed this meal was unnecessarily rushed. At that point I just asked for the bill which he pulled up on those tacky tablet things a lot of chain restaurants have now.The food wasn't even as bad as I thought it was going to be, but the hurriedness of the service really put me off. 2/5",

The blond female manager had sent people home and they then got a rush. The funny as heck black bald waiter we had was the best. He handled 10 tables with grin and a joke for each. He was as fast as he could be. The food was okay. But our waier honestly made the visit as good as it was.",

We got a table right away, but we waited about 15 minutes before our waitress arrived.  She apologized and said no one had told her that we were there. I ordered bruschetta and salad and my companions had soup and salad.  Olive Garden's soups are pretty good, I'll grant them that.  But the bruschetta was just awful.  It was just toast with chopped tomatoes, no garlic, salt or olive oil at all.  The breadsticks and salad  were just ok; I don't see why people rave over them.  Salad did have pepperoncini peppers, which were a nice touch. The waitress was polite but seemed to be either new or overwhelmed. She never refilled any of our drinks and just seemed sort of distracted. We left her a nice tip though.  I've been a waitress and know how hard it can be, especially at a chain restaurant where the crowds and their demands are never-ending.  I'm no food snob, but Olive Garden seems to aspire to lowest-common-denominator, faux-Italian food for people who've never had the real thing and don't know what they're missing.",

What makes it so great is you can taste the freshness of each of the ingredients in every dish. Each option is carefully crafted to display the perfect balance or flavors. The menu options do change due to seasonal availability for veggies/fruit which means there is always something new to try! While the prices are a little bit higher than other sit down places, it is definitely worth it.",

Not a salt or pepper shaker in sight, platters put down with no serving utensils and scarce wait staff.  The entire service disrupted concentrating on the speaker.  Several commented they felt hungry afterwards because the food lacked flavor.Also, the drinks menu is too eclectic.  Not everyone is interested in craft beers and the mixed drink options were very limited.",

They have put a great deal of thought into the atmosphere and aesthetic of the restaurant but not enough into what the customer wants to eat.  I have visited three times and each time I go I come away a little more disappointed.  The unique menu loses its appeal when the food is more satisfying to look at on the plate than it is to taste.  The ice cream sandwich dessert was perhaps the toughest dessert I have ever ordered at any restaurant.  Their one vegetarian friendly option was mac and cheese which gets tiresome to vegetarians.  With the volume of alternative diets being practiced, especially in a college town, I assumed a trendy place like this one would cater more to the non-traditional eater.  Their new twists on traditional food abandons the American-fare loving customer, as well as the non-traditionalists.",

A great, locally sourced, and seasonally rotating menu that has quite a bit of variety in terms of flavor as well as price. So if you're a cheapskate always looking to get the most for your money (like me =D) then you won't find Big Grove too bad. If you're also looking to empty your wallet they can accommodate that as well. The interior is hip, but not too hip, and I find the layout of the place pretty comfortable.The service here varies from day to day and depending on when you're dining, although I don't recall ever having a less than decent experience. Service staff is always very attentive and friendly and the food is always prepared well. They also have neat specials from time to time like half off house cocktails on Tuesdays! Overall a great place to go with a group or a date. Especially in the summer months when the patio is open!P.S. One of my favorite places for brunch in the area. If you don't care for the dinner selections you should definitely try the place Sat/Sun morning.",

The restaurant was basically empty, and I asked if we can instead push 2 regular tables in the bar area together so everyone in the party could talk with each other. They seemed annoyed and the manager made a point of saying she would check to make sure our server \"didn't mind.\" Did I mention the restaurant was empty? I would think  they would want customers and make them feel welcome. Afterwards when the bill came we asked why they didn't charge the advertised happy hour prices. The server said that's only if you sit AT the bar. We sat at tables. Wow. Bottom line: This is not a customer-focused place.",

Because of the local aspect of the ingredients, expect to pay $2-3 more than you would at a local chain, but the improved atmosphere and deliciousness definitely make it worth it!",

                "review": "Big Grove Tavern is pretty much the same food concept as the restaurant across the street (Destihl). The only difference is that Big Grove Tavern is good.I really hate hipsters. Like, some of the stuff that comes out of their mouths actually angers me. So I was not too eager to come to this place thats all \"local, farm to table, blah blah blah.\" Because a lot of times thats a hipster excuse for mediocre tasting food. I dont care if its local or organic or any of that. I just want it to be tasty!! When we walked in I was like... here we go. The OC soundtrack is playing, the menu comes on little clipboards with the farms listed on it, and there is no salt or pepper shakers on any of the tables. It seemed pretentious to me. But for the most part, everything I tried here was tasty.We had the fried cheesy grits, french fries with malt vinegar aioli, and pickled veggies for an appetizer. I didn't try the vegetables because pickled stuff is not for me. The other two passed the test.For dinner, I ordered the macaroni and cheese. In retrospect I wish I would have ordered the vegetarian version because there was so much bacon in this that it actually took away from the goodness of the cheese. But +1 for it being piping hot.The rest of the family had a pork tenderloin, beef short rib, and burger. I tasted the short rib and the burger- the rib was a little salty but still good. The burger was flavorful but for me (and this is just a personal preference) the mixture of meats made it a little too soft.We did have dessert- Gooey butter cake and a chocolate pot-de-creme. The butter cake fell a little short. I was expecting it to be warm and gooey. It was cold, not gooey, but still rich. The pot-de-creme, was... *kisses fingers like an italian chef* Perfectly bittersweet, rich rich rich, and topped with vanilla whipped cream that I could see the little vanilla speckles in. Nom.Our server was really cool and seemed to genuinely enjoy his job. He kept referring to the chef as \"chef,\" like \"chef makes this, and chef did that\" which was kind of irksome, just because its like... you're in Champaign IL, chef. Come back down to earth a little.",

It's a blend of beef, bison & pork, you can add cheese, and it has an aioli on top.  I've tried it bunless, and the meal is equally as satisfying sans bun bc the meat is so juicy and flavorful!Each time you dine in, you get a little tin of complimentary seasoned popcorn of the day.  Nice touch.  Another nice touch is the olive oil drizzle you can request on the vanilla ice cream for dessert!On my latest visit, I wandered in at brunch time and tried the chilaquiles.  Based on my previous dinners here, I had high hopes for the dish, but my heart sank with my first bite, as the pulled chicken was cold.  I was able to find a few pieces that were lukewarm, but that was disappointing.  The two poached eggs were bordering on cold too, so they had obviously been poached earlier.  Atleast the tortilla chips were crunchy...  I also appreciated the fresh cup of decaf brought to me mid-meal, since the kitchen had just brewed a fresh pot.  I would've enjoyed a meal as hot as that coffee!Last notes: I liked the strings of lights hanging from the ceiling, ornaments hanging by the bar, and snowflakes drawn in the window.  Very festive!  Music playing was right up my alley too, so I enjoyed the ambiance.",

I got the burger and it was real good - they forgot to put the egg on it like i ordered but brought me out an egg minutes later.  the drinks were really good too - had a bullet old fahioned.  All in all, definitely glad we went there and will definitely go back on the next visit.",

The welcome snack is a daily-fresh made popcorn with a rotating seasoning.  Ours was crazy good, but we had to ask the server to place the flavor:  cumin & orange zest!  Apparently the chef regularly changes it.The tap and bottle list is craft beer lover's friend. Not trying to outdo a number-of-taps contest, but all the right choices were there. Especially loved the slightly sarcastic \"These Beers?\" bottom of section of the menu for those who want a Bud Light instead.Tater tots are like nothing you've seen: homemade and tasty with an apple sauce. The smoked bacon practically jumped off the deviled eggs.The menu feels relatively small when you're used to the pages and pages on your typical chain.  And I wouldn't mind if they expanded it a bit, but there were so many good looking items, I think it will take several visits without any boredom. That most of the ingredients are locally bought makes it worth it.Service was exactly what you expect from a place like this: a whole step above any chain restaurant. Constant attention, knowledgeable about the food, funny and warm, but never over-intrusive. Perfect!Nice job, Big Grove Tavern.  We'll be back.",

This is the third time I've eaten here, so I feel qualified at this point to pass judgement. My impressions so far:The food is great...although the dinner portions tend to weigh in on the \"smaller\" side.  I had the filet, and what it lacked in size it made up for in taste. It was well cooked and tasted excellent. However, the side that came with it (a mixture of small carrots and potatoes) left something to be desired. This isn't a place you'll go for dinner and take home any leftovers.  The Risotto also tasted great, and while it also wasn't a huge portion, it seemed to be enough to suffice.  The prices were also fairly reasonable for a medium-to-upper scale restaurant, except for the $8 cocktail which seemed on the skimpy side, size-wise.Two other standouts at this place for me are the deviled eggs appetizers ($1 a piece, and delicious!) and the Tavern Burger, which is a mixture of beef, pork, and bison and is the reason I will keep going back.  For my money, it's one of the best burgers in town.",

The chef at Big Grove definitely puts out quality, tasty food that re-imagines the standard Midwestern menu.  I applaud that. However, some of the details were slightly troubling: out of draw item (burger) at 7:00 PM; slight gaffe on menu 'These beers?'; one dish that didn't quite work.3.5",

The staff was excellent - friendly, helpful with menu selections, and accommodating. The menu itself is charming - and the attention to the farm-to-table detail is commendable. There's seasoned popcorn on the table - a nice touch. I tried the very economical \"If It's From The Vine It's Fine\" daily wine special, which was quite a brilliant surprise for the price. I would recommend this to anyone. The take on a wedge salad - using bibb lettuce - was inspired. I was surprised there was no bread served with the salad. And, while I realize this is the chef's preference, I wanted some to sop up a little of the salad's very tasty creamy herb vinaigrette. And so I asked for some bread. And received some lovely bread to accompany the salad. For a main I ordered the Tavern Burger - a monster of beef, bison & pork, red onion marmalade, cornichon aioli - and served with house-cut fries. The fries were great! A bit less greasy version of those fantastic greasy kind of fries you get from a hot dog stand. Super good. As was the burger - the marmalade - and the cornichon aioli. Everything was perfect except...the bun! - Which was so bland and tough and flavorless, I tossed it to the side and knife and forked the burger.I'm sure, if I brought this detail to the staffs attention, they would have somehow taken care of things - they were nice that way. So I can only fault myself for not making an issue of it then. But man - compared to everything else - that was so great - that bun was a letdown. Regardless, I highly recommend Big Grove Tavern.",

The second time I went I met a friend and we sat at the bar. The bartender was inattentive and did not get me a water when I asked the first time. He kept walking away before I got a chance to finish ordering everything and he didn't smile once. When I finally got my food, my medium burger was almost well done, the lettuce on the burger was so soggy it dripped off my burger, and the fries were so salty that they made my stomach hurt. I couldn't finish my burger or the fries and it was extremely overpriced. I would not recommend this restaurant unless you just go for drinks or the eggplant sandwich. You will pay too much and get less than mediocre, almost inedible food.",

But nothing really special about the burger itself. The flavored were enjoyable. However I thought the mix of the buffalo and pork with the beef burger kind of ruined the burger. It made it very springy and slightly rubbery. The fries that came with it saved the dish. I don't like how they are so short and you have to use a fork but the seasoning and the texture was as perfect as fries can get. 4/5",

The food overall was bland.  We had the chili which was the best of what we ordered, the corn bread that came with it however, well, anyone could make something better tasting from a box mix.  The portabella mushroom sandwich was okay,  most of the flavor came from the butter, not sure what the cheese really was...., and the sweet potatoe chips again, we're okay.   Then came dessert. I am a sweet tooth fanatic, and I have very rarely not eaten a dessert, especially if it is chocolate based. The chocolate bread pudding looked chocolate, but had no chocolate, no sweetness, literally, no taste to it .  I kid you not. Not sure how that happens, but they seemed to master it here.  I see this place has really good reviews for dinner, so maybe it is just their Sunday brunch, but will probably not attempt to go back given the many other wonderful resturants in the area.",

Not to mention lots of very good beer bars.  This place tries to combine the two with a small but well constructed tap list and a small locally sourced menu.  My parents have been here a few times, and warned me of the downfalls (slow service, running out of menu items).  Well, I always have to check a new place out and see for myself.  After our visit, I had to apologize and thank them for humoring me.Anyway, a large open room with an island bar.  The light fixtures look like Christmas lights bought at Farm & Fleet.  The sticks on the ceiling look like they were bought at Hobby Lobby.We were seated right away, which was a good sign.  Though besides the fancy popcorn we were ignored for a long time.  I hate to be the person to say service was slow, cause it was a busy night.  I can deal with slow, but no acknowledgement what so ever was not good.  Incredibly slow kitchen times as well.We finally put our drink and food orders in at the same time.  We were not sure when we would get another chance.  I liked their beer selection.  8 taps of good micros.  Though they were out of four taps.  Half of their selection was out.  I like it when a place can go through kegs and rotate the selection, though no.  They would rather just not have half the selection.  Out of Great Lakes, out of Founders, out of Dark Horse, out of Victory.  I ended up with a Sculpin, and my Dad a Goose Island 312.  If you are going to have a small selection, you need to keep it stocked.The menu was similarly small, but looked good.  My Dad ended up with the last burger, which is a mix of beef, bison, and pork.  Sounds great.  He has tried to eat here before, twice actually.  Both times out of the burger, so it was good that he finally got to try it.   Again, it is good that they can go through the menu like that.  Though it is tiring when they keep running out.  I had the pork sausage, my Mom Mac & Cheese.  It is a tiny menu for dinner, about 5 main courses.  I love when a place can do that.  Just not enough here to pull that off.  Especially when they run out of stuff. On top of that, not much here was that great.  The burger was decent, Mac & Cheese cold, and the sausage was poorly executed with little flavor.  They shout from every corner that everything is fresh and local.  Fine, but make it good.This is one of my longest reviews, and I guess it is this way because I had very high hopes and little was as expected.  Though I was told before hand that everything was slow, over priced, pretentious, not that good, and often out.  This place just left me wanting so much more.",

I was pleasantly surprised how great the whole experience was.On Monday night they had a nice pre fixe menu for $50 with shared appetizer, soup/salad, entree, and shared dessert. Otherwise I could see dinner getting pricey here fast. We started with the Brussels sprouts which were lightly fried and not as oily as most fried sprouts. I could eat these all day.We tried a couple of deviled eggs and they fact that you can order them one apiece for $1 is nice if you just want a taste. Pretty standard, but tasty as most deviled eggs (to me) usually are. The cauliflower soup was nice as well. A bit plainer tasting than butternut squash soup, but I would still order it again with some toasted almonds. The steak entree was cooked perfectly though they never asked how I wanted it cooked. Glad they read my mind and got the medium rare cook correct. Root veggies were good too.I wasn't in love with the rice pudding, though it's not usually my thing. I didn't think it actually had rice in it...Though I don't get to Champaign too often, I would easily recommend it for someone looking for a good farm to table restaurant. Especially Mondays!",

The meat was highly overcooked, tough and chewy despite ordering it medium rare. My friend had a risotto, which just looked like mush on the plate. Both of our food came lukewarm. It was a quite busy night Im guessing, and the food sat out waiting to be taken - but any proper restaurant would manage better.When I went for lunch I had a steak sandwich - again with the toughness of the meat and a slightly stale bread this time, by the time I finished eating my jaw was sore, as if it had done some bench pressing.I'm giving 2 stars because of their poutine available on Friday and Saturday evenings after 9pm. It makes for amazing post-bars food, maybe since you are not really caring about quality as much....",

I have only tried the brunch once, but it was delicious and my whole family had a great time.  Loved the bloody mary's too.  The staff are incredible, possibly the best in town.  The servers know what they are doing and they do with elan, charm and a ready smile.  And everyone cares so deeply that the guests are having a great time.Lastly, I have been hanging out at Big Grove's beautiful bar (and I have learned that even the bar is \"local\" made by a local artisan) and it is becoming a truly cool after work watering hole.One word of advice, if you are planning on a Friday or Saturday dinner visit, you probably would be wise to make a reservation(which I did from their website via Opentable.com).  Easy to do. Try it.  You'll love it too.",

The wine list is kind of sweet too.Then of course, the food! I had the steak which was really really great, especially rare, yum! The potatoes were creamy and everything was just super tasty. My boyfriend absolutely loved his pork tenderloin. The friends we were with had the steak and chicken and loved it too. The portions were also great, I was stuffed when I was done! Next time though, I definitely want to try the appetizers and small plates. Let me also just say that  our server was awesome. Everyone there is super nice and I have a friend that works there. It's just a great crew!After dinner, we had a couple of coffee drinks (with some special stuff in it) and it was a perfect end to a really nice meal. Basically, I'm giving this place four stars because I finally don't have to keep going to Bacaro or Radio Maria for a really nice meal in this town. After being a townie and moving to Chicago, I've come to realize that it's about time that  we get more places like this in Champaign!",

It totally went with their idea that food should be natural and local, it fit.Our drinks were pretty great. I had the Frasca and my boyfriend had a bourbon drink and both were great. The wine list is kind of sweet too.Then of course, the food! I had the steak which was really really great, especially rare, yum! The potatoes were creamy and everything was just super tasty. My boyfriend absolutely loved his pork tenderloin. The friends we were with had the steak and chicken and loved it too. The portions were also great, I was stuffed when I was done! Next time though, I definitely want to try the appetizers and small plates. Let me also just say that  our server was awesome. Everyone there is super nice and I have a friend that works there. It's just a great crew!After dinner, we had a couple of coffee drinks (with some special stuff in it) and it was a perfect end to a really nice meal. Basically, I'm giving this place four stars because I finally don't have to keep going to Bacaro or Radio Maria for a really nice meal in this town. After being a townie and moving to Chicago, I've come to realize that it's about time that  we get more places like this in Champaign!",

The food was ok about a 2.5, but when combined with the moronic answers I received from the manager on duty I determined this place is run by a neutered group of men, including the manager.It starts with, I'd like sliced tomato on my hamburger.  Response: \"Chef only slices tomato for lunch not dinner\". WtfThen, I'd like some a1 steak sauce please with my burger.  response: \"chef doesn't allow us to carry a1\"Then, I'd like some Tabasco with my fries.  Response: \"chef only allows us to carry certain condiments, we have some cha lula and some siracha\". I'm like what the hell are you kidding me????I then asked to speak with the manager.  He said the chef runs every everything and she has complete say.  I asked who he reports to and he couldn't say.  I asked for the owners contact info, either email, phone or snail mail, and was given three names as-if I'm supposed to look them up myself when I was merely trying to do them a favor by letting them know how ridiculous this was.  I think I'll do myself a favor by not dining here again.",

Really enjoyed sitting there in the good weather! Our waitress let us taste a few wines before we picked a bottle, but other than that, she was pretty unpleasant. I got the succotash, which was nicely presented and the flavors were great. It was a pretty small dish, but I was warned. My friend got the chicken which was also really well put together and tasted great. While we were there, a Spanish mariachi band stopped by and played and that also really added to the fun atmosphere. The place was not overcrowded so it was really enjoyable to sit there for a while. The reason for the 4 stars is just based on the waitress we had, but the food was good and I would eat there again.",

                "review": "A solid two stars, yes!First of all, I'll say the taste of the food is pretty good.  The quality of the food and drink was above average.  The popcorn presented when we arrived was nicely flavored with spices, but came in a rather small tin.  We began with two cocktails which were delicious, but for the area, were either too small, or overpriced.  Thus began the battle of the perceptions in regards to overpriced versus tiny portions.We did not have appetizers because in my mind, they were a little pricey.  Deviled eggs for $1.00 each?  Ok, I get it, these are local eggs.  But half of an egg with a little mayo and some flavoring mixed into the yolk for $1.00?  Nope, still expensive.  Fries for $4.00?  Nope, not for this guy.  Besides, Illinois isn't know for their potato harvests.  $9.00 for a mixed greens salad?  How about make that salad plural and give us a couple of them for that price?Moving on, I wanted to try the famous \"Tavern Burger.\"  However, at 7:45 p.m., in a restaurant which wasn't packed out, they were out for the evening.  Really?  Hmmm, how strange.  You mean the cheapest choice for dinner, the one item which was mentioned in the newspaper and was considered your house specialty, and, worth mentioning again, your CHEAPEST dinner choice, was out so early?  How very strange...  I guess that meant I would have to choose a more expensive option. (And, incidentally, our server told us you made it fresh every day.  So, why didn't you just whip up a little more of the mix?  Or, does the bison truck come very morning?)We chose the Trout and the Pork Loin.  First, the portion sizes were tiny.  For the price of the trout, we expected at least half of a small trout for $18.00.  What we got was about 1/3 to  1/2 of a side of a small trout.   As for the pork, we received what amounted to about a 3 oz. portion.  Now, I understand it's local.  But, and I'm saying this as a consumer and a cook, pork is not expensive.  There is no grocery store in Champaign where you can go and find any cut of pork out pricing Beef.   And, the accompaniments, the turnips, chicory and cornbread were nice, tasty and well presented, were cool and not substantial.  The pork, for the price, should have been at least twice the size, and even this would have made the price extravagant.We shared a bottle of white wine from the menu, the wine selection being very good by the way, and also had dessert.  I had the Ice Cream Sandwich (which should have been slightly warmed so as to not have been served rock hard), and my guest had the Pot de Crme.  Both were delicious!Overall, I believe our bill totaled more than $140.00.  Can you believe it?  $140.00 for two cocktails, one bottle of white wine which retailed for about $13.00, two main dishes and two desserts.   Fine for Haute Cuisine, not fine for a tavern. We found the service to be just about perfect, as our server was attentive and respectful of both our needs and our privacy.The atmosphere is great in this place.  The food is good, but not great.  With the expanding options in the area, especially the great options across the street, there is little to nothing to draw me back to this establishment.",

                "review": "We went for an early Saturday night dinner, drawn in by new fine dining in the area (which is limited) and the promise of local farm to table style. We are huge fans of many local farm efforts, which can be sampled at the Common Ground Co-op and the Market at the Square on Saturdays at Lincoln Square Mall -- and now, Big Grove Tavern.First, the food, from a foodie perspective: Fresh product, well selected and well cared for. The flavors of the natural food are highlighted. The preparation is often minimally invasive. The technique is classic French. The flavor profile is quiet. My partner and I both wished for something a touch bolder. For example, the deviled eggs, a pre-starter, have yolks mixed with peas. We would suggest adding an acid note, perhaps a pickle. It was nice that they brought out flavored popcorn as a freebie with our drinks -- a feature at BGT. The flavor of the night was white truffle oil -- and you could taste the oil. That was a real win.For starters, my partner had the chili and cornbread, and I had the chicken liver pate with pickled onions and stewed rhubarb. I think mine was better -- really delicious, with rich, deeply flavorful pate contrasted against the rhubarb, which gave the bite the sweet and sour it needed to cut through. The farmstyle, whole grain bread had a wonderful crunch. The cornbread was a bit too refined -- it needed  more crust and less cake, more corn flavor and less cafe baked-good sweetness. The chili was savory, but mild--no real taste of chilis.The entree and dessert courses were both very good, especially dessert. My partner had the short ribs, which were beautifully medium rare -- not a hint over or under. I had the roast chicken with dumplings, which was amazingly good. Crisp skin, moist and flavorful meat, with a delicious herb broth under. Three dumplings that tasted like a delicate stuffing and had a satisfying bite. Slices of asparagus that also had a nice bite and a lovely green flavor still -- not at all cooked out. The portions seemed just right -- not too much and not too little.For dessert, my partner had the rhubarb crisp and i had the chocolate pot de creme. Both were really superb: refined, flavorful, rich, balanced. Nothing fussy -- just satisfaction in every bite, with very good coffee on the side (they use a medium blend from the Columbia Street Roastery -- a fine choice).The food is not bold. Or experimental. Or imaginative. But it is good, very good -- much better, I thought, in terms of technique than Carmon's Bistro.It's clear from the limited but well selected menu that the chef behind it is attempting to appeal to middlebrow Midwestern tastes, but doing it in such a quality way that I found it kind rather than condescending. People who don't necessarily like a chi-chi dining experience will enjoy the food, and those who do like fine dining will think it is predictable in its selections but well done nonetheless.Second, the decor and atmosphere: I generally like the blend of industrial and contemporary tavern that the interior designer seems to have been going for, although the dark colors dominate a little too much, despite the effort to add bits of fun in the lighting options. BGT has a chic, young vibe -- somewhere between casual and serious. Dark gray walls with a black drop tile ceiling, black wire-cage pendant lamps with industrial bulbs of different shapes (reminds me of the recent Restoration Hardware line), bleached branch chandeliers over the bar area, outdoor party-lights with clear exposed globe bulbs interlaced with raw blond planks (one off note: the planks have lumber-yard stamps, which may be a bit too low-end for what they were going for),  fairly inexpensive light-wood grain tables and nicely selected dark chairs--if a bit flimsy--and booth upholstery. I hope that over time BGT will invest in some better art pieces, and ones that bring more interest and warmth to the interior. There's seating outside too, if you're a smoker or don't mind getting it second hand.Third, cost: Yes, yes, it's on the expensive side. BGT is fine dining, not family dining. I won't be eating here every night either. Of course, any diner can make the meal more affordable by just sticking with an entree, rather than getting the whole shebang -- I'd guess for dinner that this would run you $20-25 tops. But if you have a deeper pocket that night, the whole shebang here could run you $100 with tip for two -- and you still won't feel cheated. The value is here, given the quality of experience.Fourth, service: BGT has a young, eager service staff. They took good care of us, and every other table I could see. From beginning to end, we enjoyed our time here.",

We went on a Monday and did the date night menu which I have enjoyed before. My boyfriend got the grits with pickled vegetables and said they were amazing. I got the pate and I could have eaten that everyday and not gotten sick of it, so good. I got the risotto and he got the filet, both equally tasty. His parents said their meals were great too. There was also a nice beer selection to choose from. The only problem I've ever had there was one of their mixed drinks tasted very funny to me. Overall, the food outweighs that though.",

I came in with a group of friends for lunch one day, and while the service was nice, the environment fine, the food was just completely underwhelming.I ordered the burger for lunch, with a side salad.  The burger was incredibly difficult to eat, and not due to excessive size, or the usual suspects.  I added an egg for 1.50, which turned out to be a mistake.  Although the flavors were OK, the bun just wasn't able to hand and got soggy, the burger decomposing as I ate it.  The proportions were off, and the lack of spectacular taste just made the meal messy with no upside.  The lettuce was completely wilted under the burger and the onions were entirely too sweet.Similarly, the salad was unfortunate.  Too much dressing and an overly generous hand of salt and citrus made the salad too salty and sour.For the entire meal, I paid $17 including tax and tip, which is OK for a downtown area.  However, I'd suggest that you check one of the other places around if you're looking for a solid burger.",

Their food is pretty good. I love the concept behind Big Grove (locally sourced, fresh, seasonal menus) but the execution is, like, not on par with how beautiful this place is. It looks GREAT. Food looks great and tastes pretty good. Their real standout dishes are their desserts. Beautiful presentation. The interior is absolutely beautiful and it's a good atmosphere for dining. I think that helps amp up the food experience.",

I went there for dinner on a Saturday night and order the chili and the whitefish. Both were very tasty, and had that been my only experience with Big Grove I would probably have given it a four or five star rating.  Unfortunately, I went there for lunch and had the chicken salad sandwich. I wish I had read the other reviews about it before I ordered.  The chicken salad was absolutely flavorless, and there wasn't much of it. The bread was dry and tasteless. Moreover, the dish cost $9.00.  I hope the owners are reading these reviews, because the chicken salad sandwich is consistently getting bad reviews, and needs to be revamped or taken off the menu altogether.",

The burger was alright; I always feel a bit jipped when a restaurant burger doesn't include tomatoes in it.

So to me, it seemed like the chicken;pork was more of a \"side\" than the main highlight of the dish. Overall, the flavors were really nice, but it wasn't anything terribly special.I would give this a 3.5. I might try this one more time and get something new, but if my overall impression is the same, it'll be the last time.So far, I preferred the other place that used to be there.",

When she would come over she wouldn't say more than 2 words to us and would leave as soon as possible. If we dared to ask her for anything she would just storm off and eventually come back with more water or popcorn since that is all we ever asked her to do. To top it all off, when we finished paying we were still talking and she came and got out receipt slips and read the tip amount! Of course she wasn't too happy since we tipped low based on how awful she was! But her doing that definitely justified to me why we tipped her low, that's for sure!Only reason I give 2 stars is because I liked the food.

Our server was really sweet and gave her opinion if we needed her help. I can't quite remember what I had because it was the special, but i thought it was delicious. It was two fried tortillas with black beans, rice, and salsa verde. It was topped with 2 fried eggs. Big Grove Tavern is not a place where you go just to \"have lunch\". It is a  place where you know you will get a good meal while feeling good about yourself because local farmers' produce is used in all steps of production.",

The menu looked very unique, flavorful and fun. However, none of the dishes blew me or my friends away. Everything was good and I appreciate how fresh the food was, but it all needed a little something more. The deviled eggs were awesome and so fun to order one at a time. Our wine was delicious and I appreciated their drink menu. The ambiance was cool as well. If I lived in Champaign I would go back, I just have a feeling that their meals are hit or miss.",

When we asked the bartender questions about the menu, he responded with an indifferent \"I don't usually work brunch\"...alrighty.  The food was delicious, but bordered on cold by the time it arrived. Bartender seemed to be tinkering around with menial tasks to avoid contact with customers.  After asking for the bill and producing a card, he walked away, forcing us to leave cash in order to get to the game.  It's gameday in Champaign, and we were decked out in Illini apparel...generally, servers know there's a game and will do their best to get you going.  I think in the future we will stick with Destihl, where service is always top-notch.",

We started with the tater tots and deviled eggs for appetizers. I loved the tater tots. They're not your typical frozen tots. They had some kind of apple puree sauce on the plate. Initially, I was skeptical, potato and apple together? It was delicious though. Holy cow. I really enjoyed that. I wish more than 4 came in an order though. The deviled eggs were nice, also. I really got a lot of the sweet pea flavor. It sounds odd but it was great and added a freshness to the egg. For dinner, several of us got the burger. Ohhhh my gosh. It was great. Cooked to the perfect temperature. It was a combo of bison, pork, and beef. The red onion marmalade on top was awesome. It added a sweetness and a lot of great flavor. A couple other people had the fried egg on top and they enjoyed it. The bun wasn't store bought and tasted homemade, very similar to what my husband bakes. It was nice to have a bun that doesn't disintegrate. The hand cut fries that came with the burger were the best fries I have had in years. Another friend INHALED the white fish. I didn't taste it but he said it was great. Someone else got the pork belly and kohlrabi gratin. She said it was great and was really happy with her choice. I wish I hadn't been at the opposite end of the table so I could have stolen a bite. It looked good. For a cocktail I had the Tavern Infusion. It was great and refreshing. There was a good selection of beer and wine, too. I stuck with one cocktail and water though. It was a nice touch when the owner came around to the tables and said hi and checked on us and other tables. She seemed really nice. Everyone at our table enjoyed the meal. We will definitely be back again, hopefully sooner than later.",

Like others before me have said, I definitely appreciate their fresh, simple approach that values quality ingredients and careful preparation.Several things hold me back from a full-throated endorsement, however.  First, the prices are steep.  The one reasonably priced entree item- the burger- frequently runs out.  I'm not sure if I just hit this place at the wrong time over and over, but I've only ordered it successfully once.  They know the demand is there, so why not have more? I understand that they don't want to freeze it, or whatever, but I've hit that place at 7 o'clock, and they're out of hamburgers.  It becomes apparent pretty quickly why there's no rush to increase their supply- because every other entree costs 5 dollars more. Secondly, the other (non-burger) entrees are small.  I rarely finish my plate at ANY restaurant, but here, it's no contest; I finish it all.  Last time, I ordered the mushroom risotto.  It was AMAZING.  I loved it!  But the size of it seemed like little more than a side dish.  My S.O. and I looked at each other at the end of the meal with our empty plates between us and I could tell we were thinking the same thing - I'm still so hungry!  Afterwards, we ended up going to Merry-Ann's around the corner for chili cheese fries (our adventure at that establishment is detailed in another review).Finally, service is hit or miss.  Last time, my S.O. ordered the special.  The server said that she wasn't sure they still had the special, so he went ahead and ordered a back-up entree in case (this was his idea, not hers).  She never came back to tell us what result.  The runner came out with our food, and of course, it was not the special, but the backup.  She was busy, but it would have been nice if she had just swung by and told us that they were indeed out of the special.  I think she might have been new, because her server-patter was also wanting. (She really didn't know what to say to us when she first approached the table.)  She also forgot my Patio Pounder (a great cocktail, BTW) until I reminded her, and I only got it once I was almost done with my entree.  I had water, so it was no big deal, but the overall experience (coupled with the bill at the end) quashed the overall good vibe of the place.Before I move, I do think I will go back and give it another shot.  Their date night menu looks like a good deal, and I'm really rooting for this place to be all it can be.",

I would have given this place 4 stars if not for the service, which has been some of the worst I have received in Champaign-Urbana.  More on this shortly.I love select dishes on the menu, but I feel like you have to know what to order.  The burgers are INCREDIBLE.  I never want to eat another burger that is not a mix of beef, bison, and pork.  Awesome.  And the fries with it are great!As much as I enjoy the burgers, there are times that you want some variety.  I know that it is trendy to include deviled eggs on a menu, but this are nothing special.  However, I feel like the pretzel makes up for this.  The pretzel is great and if you like your mustard with a HEAVY amount of spicy horseradish, this is for you!  I also really enjoyed the pork belly, but wish it was larger than just a starter.All of that being said, all of my recent experiences there have been a service disaster!  We have enjoyed going for the Friday outdoor concert series because we can sit outside and enjoy dinner, a beer, and the music.  In fact, until the service problems began we would go every week religiously.  Earlier in the summer the service was not a problem.  However, the past several times we have gone, we have literally had to BEG to be waited upon.  Each of these times, we have arrived, been seated, and then waited for 20-30 minutes before any server came to our table to even take a drink order.  We have had to ask the hostess or manager, some times several times in the same meal, to have one of the wait staff come to our table just to take an order.  The last straw was when the same friend was there for TWO DIFFERENT MEALS IN A ROW (seated at an entirely different table) and she too was talking with the management to try and get someone to take our order.The paranoid person in me worries that this lack of service is because we came with a small child.  Our child is quite well-behaved in a restaurant, but we try to be courteous and go for very early dinners when we know she will not be a problem.  We always try to order the full meal (drinks, dinner, dessert) up front and ask that the bill be given to us when the drinks arrive so we can make a quick get-away if necessary.  My point is that this is the one time that we actually get to go out and enjoy an adult meal and activity and I don't want it regularly spoiled by bad (or nonexistent) service, regardless of whether or not it is because I have a child with me.  I have wasted this time for several weeks in a row at Big Grove and don't plan on doing so again for a long time.  There are plenty of other options in the area.",

                "review": "Thank god for this place. That's really all I can say. Well no, I can say more. But before I get to the meat of my review, no pun intended, let me say that Big Grove Tavern is exactly what this town needed. When Jim Gould's closed I was sad to see it go but what has come in it's place is something really fantastic. From the food to the interior to the crowd, the energy Big Grove gives off is infectious and demonstrates that the confluence of intellect and small-town charm in Champaign can really lead to something amazing.Now on to the food:Popcorn: Come for free as a starter. While I was hoping for bread, I was even happier with this. The popcorn really whets your appetite without being too filling. I hear the flavor changes; it was definitely some kind of lime (think the hint of lime you find certain Mexican foods) flavor when I was there.Tavern Burger: There are so many things I can say about the Tavern Burger. First and most simply, it's delicious. The blend of bison was for me, the most prominent of the three meats that make up the burger but overall I found it to be rich, meaty and just the right amount of gamey given the bison. The onion marmalade, and petite crusty bun complimented the burger without overpowering the taste of the meat. I opted to add the fried egg which led to messy experience given the soft yolk, but a certainly more delicious one. At this point, if I did this right, you are so convinced about the deliciousness of the burger you won't even care to hear about the fries. But hey, if you're still interested: they're completely well-executed- crisp yet still potatoey. Now... onto my other comment on the Tavern Burger. There was some review on here about how the burger is in limited quantities. That's how you know it's fresh and locally sourced! If I wanted something from a freezer I'd head down by the mall and swallow some hormone-laced, bacon-cheese-blue cheese-fried onion-black forest-ham-ranch dressing-heart attack in a bun. If you want a burger that satisfies your burger craving while still being an appreciable entree and cut of meat, come enjoy the Tavern Burger. And if you've missed it, just come back and try again! And frankly, at 12 bucks, it's not that bad. The downtown Champaign restaurant scene generally errs on the more expensive side. Given what Jim Gould's prices used to be like, Big Grove is far more reasonable price-wise in comparison. In sum, ignore the hate, embrace the love, Big Grove will have you leaving full, happy and pleasantly surprised by what Champaign has to offer food-wise.",

                "review": "I was glad to see something young and fresh in place of Jim Gould. Gould was boring and dated, but the only option we had in the C-U if you wanted to go to a \"nice\" restaurant. Big Grove Tavern has a casual updated atmosphere with an original concept for the C-U (farm to table). We wanted to go to Destihl (right across from Big Grove) yesterday for lunch,  but there was a wait and we couldn't wait. We finally had a chance to try Big Grove. There was no wait, and we were seated right away. We were with our 2.5 year old, and  we have never gone to a kid restaurant. Our daughter is used to dining in grown up restaurants with grown ups, but even the most patient of young foodies could use a quiet distraction while they wait.  Destihl is not a kids' restaurant, but they have a variety of foods to choose from on the kids' menu and they give the kids crayons to color on the kids' menu. Smart and simple concept that works well. The server at Big Grove said they do not have a kids' menu, but they have \"kid friendly\" options. All they had was grilled cheese and sweet potato fries. I asked if we could just get regular potato fries and the server said \"yes\" so that is what my daughter got. I never understood the whole trend of replacing delicious french fries with sweet potato fries--they don't taste better nor are they \"healthier\" or much lower in calories. If you are going to eat fries make them from potatoes not sweet potatoes. I wanted to order a burger, but all their burger options are a blend of beef, bison and pork and I don't want to eat bison so I ordered the Black Bean Burger.  My husband ordered \"The Baltimore\"which is basically a BLT with avocados. My daughter's fries had more salt than there is in salt. Maybe it was just that day, but someone went really heavy handed with the salt. My Black Bean Burger was really good. It's not what I wanted to eat, but if you are vegetarian (I have been on and off for years) this was delicious. My husband's order was okay. It's a BLT with avocado. Why take a classic and add something that adds nothing? The server was great--very nice person and efficient. The design and layout of the restaurant is great. Casual and open. Trying to be a gastropub, but misses the mark with the menu. It's still a big step up for the C-U in terms of dining options. I liked this place. I like the concept, the layout, the service, but the menu is not for me. The food is not bad, but not great. Too many options like a classic burger or BLT are turned into things that are trying too hard to be \"cheffie\", but miss the mark. I just wish they didn't try to reinvent the wheel on these American food classics. If they're going to reinvent the classics they better make them better than the original. I would have liked to see a few classics taken up a notch with a gourmet twist or just a few classics done really well. Overall Big Grove is worth a try, but I wouldn't highly recommend it or anything because the food options are limited and the food tastes okay. Not great, just okay.",

I ordered a chicken salad sandwich and it was described as coming with mixed greens since I'd rather have that than sweet potato chips and there was no salad when I got my sandwich. When I asked the waitress she said my salad was on my sandwich...which did have a piece of lettuce on the bottom. Besides that my sandwich was very dry and tasteless. My lunch mate wanted a cup of chili and was told emphatically they only had bowls but when it arrived it was the smallest cup of chili I have seen and for 7$?  The cornbread was bigger than the cupAnother person in the party had the burger.  The 12$ burger. When it arrived it looked like a slider.  I do think he said it was good, but there are far better burger for a better price than 12$.Our bill for lunch for 4 was 70$. Way too expensive for lunch. Even a NYC lunch but the food was not worth it at all.  On the way out a couple diners seated next to us said they couldn't wait to get on their Facebook accounts to let people know how bad this place is. And we agree. I give this place 6 months. Save your money and go to destihl or any other burger joint for better food",

I was wrong...I was down in the U of I area during homecoming and made a reservation just in case it was packed for an early dinner. When we arrived, the place was empty. We were taken to our table and given this small one page menu. I thought it was the drink menu, but no, it was the dinner menu. A bit suprised, I asked my father if he would rather go to DESTIL across the street, but he wanted to try this new local joint. We decided that I was going to get the \"famous\" burger and my dad was going to get the Mac and Cheese. Our server came over and my dad started by ordering the Mac and Cheese, but he asked if he could get it without the onions (shallots and leeks). He was told NO because they already have it premixed. Premixed? She assured him that there was not alot of onions so we continued. For $12 on the burger and $14 for the Mac and Cheese, we were expecting something spectacular. My burger came out. It was a mix of bison, beef, and pork. I was expecting something very flavorful. It was bland as could be. Also, it was about 1/8 of a pound. One of the smallest burgers I have ever eaten. The fries that came with this was good, but the dish was not worth it. My dad's Mac and Cheese came out in a small bowl and half of it was made up of shallots and leeks. I tasted it and thought that it was good, but he HATED it. We had the manager called over and he took it away and took it off of the bill without us asking. He asked if we wanted something else, but my dad complained that the menu was too small for him to go with anything else. Instead of apologizing, the manager told him \"well its all local\" and he walked away. Our server was nice, but I could overhear the hostess and the manager talking about future reservations for the night with an attitude and snarky responses to each other. People can hear you folks!  It was as if they were doing us a favor by being open. In short, skip this place and go to other places within a block of this place. They know how to treat their customers and not to overcharge. I would suggest Guido's!",

Everything blended together perfectly... A medley of flavor so irresistible it has me drooling and wishing I could come back for more. You can trust me on this. I like food. A lot. But this burger changed my life. Buy the Tavern Burger. You won't regret it. One thing I would say: their definition of how well the meat is done is different than most, it is much less cooked than what a usual burger would be. Probably rule of thumb would be to order up from what you usually get if you don't like or are picky about how pink your meat is. i.e. If you're like me and like your burger \"medium rare\" order \"medium\" if you really don't like your meat any more pink than what you are used to. I would highly recommend this restaurant to all people looking for an exceptional and creative meal.",

We each had breakfast  burritos, and they were quite good.   We also shared a pecan cinnamon roll, and it was awful.   It was cold and hard, and i wouldn't have been surprised if someone told me it came from Sams.   The most disappointing for me was the coffee, as it was only lukewarm.   I should have asked for a new pot, but by this time our waitress wasnt around much.  I feel like she probably just needed trained better ( she came frequently when not needed and infrequently when required,  she also didn't know how to read when the table was ready to order or needed anything).  All that being said... it was a nice restaurant and i would return for brunch.  I'm not sure it's  worth the dinner prices,  but it's definitely worth the brunch prices.",

My husband ordered the Tavern burger (beef, Bison, and pork) and I ordered the Grilled Cheese because it was the only thing besides the burger that I thought I might like and it was only $8.  We each got a deviled egg ($1 each) and they were good, a little on the salty side though.  We also enjoyed the small bucket of popcorn you get for free.  Hubby's burger came with a huge pile of fries (good because the burger is $12, cheese is $1.50 extra) and I got a mixed green salad with my grilled cheese.  The vinaigrette on the salad was a bit salty as well.  The food was okay, the service was great, I like the fact that everything is locally sourced.  We might be back for dinner sometime, but we'll see...it's very expensive.",

I had the falafel, which was a tad dry, but it's falafel, and this is easy to screw up - forgivable.  The other dishes were great.  Excellent turkey sandwich, though the sourdough is a bit airy for my tastes.  A traditional sourdough needs some ... sourness and doughiness - this really does taste like airy French or Italian bread. The saged popcorn is a nice touch, but I have been here about seven times, and it is always saged popcorn, and the server consistently says \"Our popcorn -today- is fried sage\". ... which to me implies that this will change once in a while.  In my experience, it does not. Finally, and this has been said *dozens* of times here.  The prices are completely out of line with Champaign.  I can get locally sourced ingredients to create a Turkey sandwich and mixed green salad at the local grocery, and a 10oz bottle of the same beer.  Grand total will be well under $20 with a full six pack and ingredients to spare. My damage for lunch?  $23 after a modest tip.  The following day I had a (good) soup of Yellow Beet root and mixed green salad.  To be clear, we are talking about a CUP of soup and a small plate of salad, for $18. Completely out of touch with the local area and absolutely haranguing customers on the guise of farm-to-table.  Want to like it based on the food, can't stand to be here based on the price.

Good atmosphere, good service, good beer.Full review:Based on my two trips to the Big Grove, it seems to be hit or miss.The first time I went, around January of 2014, I was extremely impressed. I had pork belly as an appetizer (amazing) with a Dogfish Head 90 minute to chase it down (the beer selection is pretty great). For dinner, I had a perfectly cooked steak (don't remember the cut), served alongside gnocchi. Everything I ate was relatively simple, but they executed perfectly on the local, farm to table ingredients (they're proud of that here). Service was fantastic.The second time I went, in July 2014, the food was very disappointing. The steak was solid again, but it was served alongside one of the most bitter, poorly cooked broccolini I've ever had the displeasure of tasting. The pork tendorloin was chewy, definitely do not recommend. And this time, the pork belly appetizer was served differently, as a salad. I think it's pretty difficult to screw up pork belly, but they managed to do so. It tasted as if it were cooked a day ago, and it was difficult to find much pork belly beneath the greens. Service was tremendous on both occasions. Our water and popcorn (the popcorn is great) were refilled consistently, and the waiter seemed to take pride in the food.",

The restaurant is very inviting and rather large. I love the clean feeling and the hardwood floors. We were seated in the front of the restaurant right near windows for people watching, loved that. There are these cute containers of popcorn on the table. The popcorn is salty, but sweet, nice touch! I checked in on foursquare and got a free deviled egg! The deviled egg was very tasty and different than anything I've ever had.. The egg with the combination of cabbage was tasty! The beer menu was pretty big, which we liked. Unfortunately, we were told right away that they were out of the bison burger, which is one of the reasons we chose this place, so that was very disapointing. I ordered the Mac and Cheese and hubby ordered the steak that came with potatoes and veggies, well done. We had a couple rounds of drinks and our food came. My mac and cheese was good, but a bit dry because of the amount of bread crumbs. I feel like the bread crumbs needed to have more butter or moisture. The cheeses and bacon made this macaroni and cheese pretty good. It isn't something I'd order again for $14, but I liked it. My husbands steak, seemed awfully small for a $20 meal. Probably about 4 oz of meat. Plus, it was cooked more medium than medium well. The sides on the plate were pretty good. Overall, the place was nice, but a bit overpriced for the portions.",

I didn't argue over the 8 person rule, so why would that be her response?! On a separate occasion I've had my reservation lost which led to a 30 minute wait.

I usually don't like the taste of anise, but this was really good, and we got free refills without asking.We ordered a vegetarian ragout (creamy with a hint of spiciness), the burger (it's big burger a unique taste from the mix of beef, pork, and bison), the pork shoulder (cooked perfectly), and the pork sausage (after the waitress checked on us, we discovered the root vegetables weren't cooked well enough; the dinner is on a low-carb diet and wasn't going to eat them anyway, but the waitress was very receptive when we mentioned it later). Also two beers--I can't remember which. We didn't have room for dessert, but if it's still on the menu, I want to try the spiced pumpkin bread pudding. Hello? Heaven is calling...Pros: good, local food; great staff; reasonable prices at the \"expensive for a college student\" level (c. $15 per entree)Cons: dim lighting + aging eyes + small print on the drink menu = squintingnoise level --All too often it seems that chic decor and sound-proofing are non-intersecting circles of restaurant interior design.

The special, in particular, did not have a price listed. Be sure to come here for a celebration or special event, it's quite lovely.",

                "review": "I visited with my mom on my birthday back in October, and it was absolutely the right choice. Our server was as friendly as could be and gave great suggestions for our meal. The cocktail she recommended to me- I think it was called a Georgia Peach?- was yummy, though it tasted much more like melon than peach. The Seared Pork Belly was totally decadent- buttery, full of umami flavor and perfectly crisp on the outside. Mom got the Faroe Islands Salmon, which was excellently cooked, though the lentils were a touch under-salted. We shared the Apple and Pear Crisp for dessert, which was delicious as well, but my entree really won the night.I ordered the Roasted Mushroom and Poached Farm Egg. I'd originally planned on the Mac n Cheese, but our waitress persuaded me to give the egg dish a shot, and I am so incredibly happy I did. The egg was poached impeccably, and when the yolk broke over those grits, I nearly wept. Everything about it, from concept to execution, was excellent. The grits were rich and creamy, the mushrooms were delightfully earthy and tender, and whatever they did to that sauce was magical. I honestly feel a little depressed that I'll never get to eat it again. It keeps me up at night.On second thought, maybe I should give them 1 star, because they ruined my life with their amazing food. Thanks a lot, guys.",

                "review": "Atmosphere? Fun and trendy. Food? Average.Initially, I was really excited to try this place while staying in Champaign. First off, I love farm-to-table restaurants and Big Grove Tavern does a really great job of utilizing local and regional farms. One of my favorite parts of the restaurant is a large map displayed on their wall that pinpoints where each of their ingredients comes from - how awesome is that! When it comes to the restaurant's atmosphere, it's trendy mix of both contemporary and rustic chic. The ceilings are lit with old-fashioned string lights and vintage lightbulbs, and hanging above the bar are driftwood chandeliers. After flipping through the clipboard dinner menu, I decided on the free-range roasted chicken with herb dumplings, green beans, shiitake mushrooms, and fingerling potatoes. The portion size is good, but the flavor was not anything spectacular. The chicken was juicy, but the rest of the dish was undercooked - especially the green beans and fingerling potatoes. All in all, this average tasting dinner dish was not worth $19. For dessert I decided on the girl scout thin mint brownie sundae, complete with mint ice-cream, brownies, chocolate ganache, and sprinkled with peppermint candy (I mean come on, who doesn't love thin mints?) It may have been served in a glass goblet, but unfortunately my expectations of this dessert were much too high. The brownie and ice-cream were good, but the whole dish was overloaded with crushed peppermint candy - it ruined the flavor of the rest of the dessert! I would not recommend wasting $7 on this glorified sundae. Next time I'm in Champaign, I'll be trying out another restaurant in hopes of getting my money's worth.",

Definitely my scene.Started with their fried brussels sprouts (also a trendy food item on top of the trendy decor! theme??) with tuffle aioli and sea salt and nothing like a little sea salt to push a dish over! These things were addicting. I shared a little, but not much! Gotta love some good brussel sprouts. I still don't get why kids hate these things so much???Then since I ate vegetables to start like a good kid (I know, yes they were fried, but come on, let me have my cake and it too, okay?), I thought that granted me the ability to get their mac and cheese in a little oven baked dish packed with tons of cheese, bacon, leeks, fried shallots, and then as it should be, topped with crumbled bread crumbs! Mmmmmm that mac and cheese was exactly how I like my mac and cheese! Hot, creamy, cheesy, goodness. Done and done. Plus they had a good beer selection here too, the only thing I think that was missing was more attentive service since I would have ordered more beer if they had come around more quickly and the water service, but pretty minor! I definitely would come back here if I visited again!",

Since that initial visit, I have now tried their chicken and dumplings and the skirt steak. The chicken was lovely, moist and well seasoned, the dumplings, however, were a bit of a downer--they were SALTY, small, and sparse, nothing exciting. I might try the dish again, but will have to ask them to be mindful of their salt. The skirt steak was cooked as requested (medium) and was surprisingly tender. I think that they change the accompanying veggies seasonally, but it's always served with a chimichurri (sauce). Given that chimi is one of my favorite sauces, I'll admit that I was skeptical of trying it in Champaign, and was pleasantly surprised--the downfall, they serve it as decorative dots on the plate, rather than a sauce for the meat so there's hardly any of it to enjoy! As you can see, my review of the food has much improved since my first post. I still think that it is overpriced for the portions and location (come on it's Champaign!). My last waitress was pretty good--so service also seems to have improved (or I might've just been lucky).",

After being seated the waitress came within 5 minutes and took our drinks.. 2 lemonades and a Moscow Mule..lemonades came quickly..20+ minutes for the Mule. 20+ minutes later our order was taken...over 40 minutes later we received our food. I was accompanied by my son and 3 year old granddaughter celebrating her birthday.  Items ordered were the flank steak, mac and cheese and kids menu (only 2 items to choose from) chicken tenders.  The food was good but not great. We also ordered ice cream for my granddaughter's birthday and a sweet potato cake that was dry and had a weird after taste.  Our bill came to $80 FRICKN dollars!!! Way way over priced!! This reminds me of Jim Goulds that went out of business for this reason!!I agree with previous reviews that they are trying too much to be different and have Chicago or New York prices. In conclusion, we were there for over 90 minutes (with a 3 year old), food was good but not great and extremely over priced..will not return as there are many better options in Champaign-Urbana.",

Although the portion sizes seemed a bit off (the carb to main item ratio seemed a bit off for both my friend and my dishes) the food was flavorful and the desserts (vanilla ice cream and the olive oil cake) were delicious and worth sticking around for.

I've never had a combination of beef, bison, and pork.  Both were cooked to a perfect medium.  However, he ordered his with the additions Amish white cheddar and a fried egg, with the marmalade and aioli on the side.  I ordered mine with everything and a fried egg.  The red onion marmalade was amazing!  I was eating my fries with the bf's side portion.  Next time, I'm asking for extra!  It was so messy, but well worth the lean-in at the bar.  I almost forgot!

Alas, it is not to be.In spite of many available tables, we were seated in a dark and cavernous (all in black) alcove.  Although elsewhere it was the bright light of day, we were barely able to make out the menu in the darkness.  We ordered wine by the glass to start; they waved the bottle over the glass and delivered a very small quantity for a full price pour.  Actually, I like the option of small-glass, but only if they offer the option of paying accordingly...I've had larger pours at free wine tastings around town.  Illinois is beer country, and as they are going local perhaps we would have been better to order a local brew.We waited a long time for our food, allowing our meager splash of wine to warm in the glass so as to save the few swallows to have with our meal.  At long last when it arrived, the spouse's was pleasant enough but mine was not at all as described.  I had ordered the chicken salad on wheat bread with greens; one of the few sandwiches that did not say it was served with chips. All flavors were erased by a thick layer of Dijon mustard and it was served on very dried out toast with chips on the side.  The \"greens\" were a piece of lettuce inserted between the mass of mustard and the dried out bread.  The person at the next table ordered the same dish and had the same impression, asking the waitress where the greens were and commenting on the dried out toast. It was supposed to have tarragon and other interesting ingredients, but every flavor was eclipsed by the strong Dijon mustard.Don't know if it was the worst lunch I had since moving here last summer, but it was clearly the most expensive bad lunch I have had, approaching $50 for two sandwiches--one nearly inedible--and a smidgeon of wine. This was very expensive for mixed quality, not a good value.Pluses: I like that they are trying to source from local farms, although I missed having a fish or seafood option on the menu.  The staff was very friendly. Minuses: Expensive, very small portions, descriptions on menu not accurate, food quality uneven, some bad seating locations.  I gave it two stars for the effort to source locally and the friendliness of the staff.  I a willing to give them a try again in a couple of months to see if they iron out the kinks, but only if I am feeling extravagant.",

But what runs a restaurant is the food, and we gave it plenty of tries.In January we were in for a date night on the weekend and we told they had oysters! Oh how we miss them. The server seemed pretty confused on how they came, what they were and what sauce came with it, so we went ahead and gave it shot. How can you mess up an oyster, right? Well, good god this was so disgusting! The oysters were on ice, but filled to the brim with this gross creamy orange liquid that was tepid and just...GROSS! It totally covered the whole flavor of the oyster and was absolutely a disgrace to the beauty that's an oyster. So tepid sauce and somewhat cold oyster - feels like a temperature danger zone to me. So again, I'm thinking, the chef is from SF and she does that to an oyster?! Yikes. We then decided to not order dinner because of those oysters (and didn't want to seem like cheapskates) and got the chocolate budino. That dessert is supposed to be pudding-like, but was SO hard and impossible to put a spoon, knife and fork in. So we sat and waited for it to get a little softer, but it was more like a little jar of chocolate that was melted and then refrigerated back into a chocolate bar. That was in no way rich and creamy and custard-like. I would call it \"Chocolate Brick In A Cute Mason Jar\".Came back again and had Sunday brunch as there are limited options in Champaign-Urbana. I ordered the chicken hash and my partner got the huevos rancheros...I think. My chicken hash was full of those bits of chewy cartilage-like chicken that you would, ya know, throw away! Not one piece was edible chicken. I felt absolutely jipped and told the server who didn't seem to care or knew what to do? And the scone we got was just a rock hard lump of dough over baked. I mean you could use that thing as a weapon, lol. So depressing for such a beautiful restaurant and concept. :-/As some have said in their reviews, too: the food is nothing extraordinary. Honestly, for each of our experiences it was pretty gross and I couldn't tell if we came in on off times or what, but not impressed at all. Yuck.",

I looked at both menus, and frankly, because big grove was second, I stayed there. I opted to sit outside, in the sun. It was not bad at all.Onto the  experience... first of all, my waitress was great and very attentive. Each table gets a little bowl of popcorn to start, which is cool. Anyways, their menu is locally sourced, and quite small. They have a few appetizers, and I indulged in two of them. I had a deviled egg (dollar per), and I also ordered the pickled vegetables (radish, onion, fennel, and carrot). The deviled egg came with a rye crisp and sauteed red onions. It was okay, and I'm glad I only ordered one. On the other hand, the pickled vegetables were fantastic! A little pricey at 3 dollars, but definitely the highlight of my meal.For my main course, I ordered the pork, bison, and beef burger. I had the aioli and red onion marmelade on the side. I like my burgers medium. I also ordered mine on whole grain bread instead of the standard bun.The burger was average. It was not cooked medium well, and there was some yellow sauce (not the aioli, but possibly a mustard) that ended up on my burger, even though I asked for my burger plain. My mixed greens salad with the vinagrette was good. My second favorite part, and I'm not a salad fan at all.Overall, a decent place. Nothing special. My bill was 17 dollars, and I did not order a drink or anything. I like the feel of the restaurant, but honestly, I'll probably go somewhere else in the area before I head back here.",

For dinner we tried 4 of the 6 starters and all I have to say is that the hash browns were excellent and I could probably eat the pickled veggies every day and never tire of them. The Pate is a must try and the deviled eggs are just perfect. We tried 4 of the soups/salads and while I was not a fan of the seared pork belly, others at the table thought it was very good but the cheesy grits on the bottom were amazing. The cornbread was delightful (almost as good as Black Dog) and the chili just right. I look forward to trying the other items. The entrees were a great size and very well done. I had the pan seared fish which was perfectly cooked and had a side of pickled veggies. The cornbread stuffing on another plate was so good. The chicken was very tasty. The steak was cooked to a great temp. We also had the mac and cheese, they seem to understand that people like cheese and bacon because this dish did not disappoint. I plan on going for dinner many times. For lunch we were disappointed that the burger had already run out but we will have to go back earlier to try it. The steak sandwich was very good but the star on that plate was the Sweet Potato Chips, they were absolutely delicious. The horseshoe was very good and I especially enjoyed the sauce. I will be heading over there again for lunch very soon.This place is a great addition to downtown Champaign and a great replacement to Jim Gould's. The decor is very well suited to the atmosphere the place is trying to convey. I love that they expanded the bar. The prices are a bit high compared to some of the other places downtown but the food is of such a great quality that it is well worth the price.My biggest disappointment is that I am always too full to try the desserts because they look very good.",

                "review": "I have been to Big Grove a few times, with mixed results, but lunch today will be my last visit. Service:When we arrived, the restaurant was less than half full. Our server's name was Daniel. My friend and I ordered Chili Cheese Fries as an appetizer (I specified that we wanted it out first) and two sandwiches as the main course. About twenty minutes passed and our sandwiches came out, carried by a different server. I asked him about our appetizer and he had no idea. He found our server at the wait station, who then came over and without any apology told us that the kitchen had messed up our tickets. He returned with the app a minute later and mumbled something about the Chili Cheese Fries taking longer on average than the Cuban sandwich which I had ordered. The Cheese Fries were soggy and lukewarm. First of all, I absolutely hate it when a server blames the kitchen. It is so petty, and makes the whole restaurant look bad, especially at a place which supposedly prides itself on it's chef-driven sensibilities. Next, there is no way that a plate of chili fries takes longer than a Cuban sandwich. It was clear to me that the appetizer had sat in the window way too long, which is why it was tepid and soggy. This tells me that our app was finished by the kitchen in good time, and then just sat there until after our sandwiches had already been ran. No point having a chef in the kitchen if the food dies in the window. Even if the kitchen did screw up, which I highly doubt, the server is responsible for taking care of us and smoothing it over. Throwing the kitchen under the bus is a pathetic excuse. I cannot stand a person who won't take accountability for the mistakes. Next: Halfway through my sandwich, I decided to order a second beer, as the draught list there is excellent. Not only did our server fail to offer me a refill, but I COULD NOT get his attention. I spent over ten minutes waving my hands, trying to get him to our table. I'm going to repeat that this place was far from busy. I watched him bus tables, have personal conversations with other staff, and generally ignore us. I ended up flagging down the second server who ran our food, who took my order to Daniel (who was standing at the bar talking to staff.) After another five minutes, he managed to produce my order. Completely unsatisfactory. Fifteen minutes to order and receive a beer during a slow lunch is unbelievable. At this point, we had been seated for almost an hour. Daniel then dropped the check and returned our receipt with no kind words, apology, or gratitude for coming. We did not feel welcomed or taken care of at all. Simply some of the worst service I've had in CU. Food:Chili Cheese Fries would have been tasty had they been hot and fresh. No one likes soggy fries. Inattention ruined that dish. My Cuban was shy on meat and priced at $12. Destihl, right across the street, also offers a Cuban sandwich with way more meat priced at $10. The flavor with Grove's version was good, but the value sucked. My friend enjoyed her Grilled Cheese. Conclusion:  After a half-dozen visits over the last 18 months, both for lunch and dinner, we have not had one satisfactory meal, due to sub-par service.  There is no point sourcing your produce and protein from local farms if the kitchen is sabotaged by terrible service and high price-points. Over-hyped and not worth the money. This place is all hat and no cattle. We will not return and will tell everyone we know to avoid it.",

Sometimes it is a little slow, but servers are always friendly and do their best for you.The So-So: *menu tends towards fancified home cooking, which is not a bad thing.  But given that, it seems a bit overpriced for what you get.  The food we've had as been consistently okay, but not amazing.  Dinner?  Okay.  Brunch (which I really, really wanted to love)?  Again, just okay.  If you don't cook a lot at home, this can be a great place for you.  If you are a successful and inventive home cook, you might not be as impressed.  Con:**This is the thing that makes me not want to give Big Grove another chance.  We were in about 6 months ago (August), and both ordered the burger.  We requested some tomato to go with it, and the waitress came back- somewhat sheepishly, to her credit- and told us that the kitchen didn't serve it with tomato.  Okay.  I've been to fine dining restaurants, and I understand that chefs conceptualize the flavors of a dish in a particular way, and that's the way they want you to experience it.  But a burger?  And, more importantly, this burger?  It's fine, but it's not all that.  Perhaps they were just out of tomatoes?  But anyway, the fact that they were so proud of this burger keeps gnawing at me.  Overall:*Good drinks, fine ambience, good service.  In the greater scheme of things, they are still fairly new, so maybe they'll continue to evolve?  I hope so, because I'd love to see them reach a little bit higher; there seems to be potential for more here.",

This place takes both reservation and walk-ins, which was very helpful during graduation weekend when all the restaurants are packed.First impression: the place is trendy - you can sit in the bar area, tables, booth, or even outside during the summer. During brunch people come in their sweatshirt and sweatpants, but the dinner crowd is more well-dressed. I had a good experience with the service everytime I go to this place. They serve you popcorn with spices of the day as a complementary snack.Dinner:I came here with my vegetarian friend so all the items we ordered from the menu is vegetarian!- Devilled eggs: delicious, but not dying for it- Chilled roasted beets: very very delicious - I honestly prefer the beets to the devilled eggs for appetizer- Roasted sunchoke risotto: Errr... It's just ok. I've had better risotto before. I think it's a little bland- Veggie mac and cheese: Also just ok. Among all 4 items we order, I like the beets the most!Brunch:To be fair, I've been ordering the same thing over and over again: CHILAQUILES. My mouth is literally watering as I am writing this. It is absolutely heavenly!!! The tortilla is well covered in spices and it is between crunchy and soft corn tortillas. The shredded chicken is so soft and it melts in my mouth! MUST TRY! The portion is very generous I usually can't finish the whole plate in one meal.My boyfriend had the eggs benedict before and he said it was good, but it's something you can find anywhere!Did I mention they have good selection of cocktails? LOVE THE BLOODY MARY!! Overall I give 3 stars for the dinner and 5 for the brunch and thus 4 stars!! It's also a good place to chill and drink on sat/ Friday night.",

I did not get the Aioli on my burger.  It was DELICIOUS!  for me the fried egg made this burger one of, if not THE best in Champaign/Urbana.  And i've had what is considered to be in the top 5 in america at Kuma's Corner in Chicago, its not that good, or that big, but its plenty excellent.  the house cut fries were very good too, i loved the seasoning.my wife raved about the Beer Brined Pork Loin, saying it was \"delicious\".  The place is a little pricy, but they also have very close attention to detail and the food is all from local area suppliers, which is a nice touch and compliment to the local growers.I will be back again at this restaurant, i can't wait to try the BLT with the egg at lunch next!",

We got in at 4:30 and the server informed us we couldn't order dinner until 5, so we got a table and dissected the menu for ~30 minutes, ordered some drinks, and a bar snack or two.We opted to sit outside on a beautiful Sunday evening. Though I must mention the inside of Big Grove has a cool ambiance. Very dark/modern types of colors with some interesting tree/woodwork stuff hanging from the ceiling.Wine by the glass happened to be half off that evening, which was a pleasant surprise. I had a smoother French one which I forget the name of and my mother had a French Malbec, I tried to look them up online when I got home but it seems their wine list isn't 100% up to date online. Dad opted for a beer, the Left Hand Milk Stout Nitro, which ironically my roommate just ordered last weekend at Black Dog! He really enjoyed it but thought it wasn't served cold enough. No frosty glass, kind of a turn off for my Pops....We started with the deviled eggs and hushpuppies. The eggs were just OK and I thought the hush puppies were pretty tasty, especially with the sauce they came with! My mother said they were just fair.For dinner, my Uncle got the Free-Range chicken which he liked a lot. He particularly enjoyed the chicken jus as well as the dumplings that came with it. Mom and Dad split the short ribs, which they both thought were exceptional, and believe me, my mother is highly critical of short ribs, since she can cook up some mighty fine ones herself. I can verify via taste that these were not your average short ribs, I'd highly recommend these. On a last second split decision between the skirt steak and the pork tenderloin, I opted for the latter. This was also a really well put together dish that came with carrots, endive, and these glorious sweet potato hash brown patty things. The pork itself was done a perfect medium-rare and was flavorful, juicy and overall a nicely executed plate that would not have been the same without the creamy mustard sauce it was all sitting on.We did have some qualms which would have normally warranted only a 3 star review if it wasn't for how well everyone enjoyed their entrees. The beer I mentioned above could definitely have been served colder. Our server didn't seem to take the hint when my dad mentioned he liked frosty glasses. Our other major qualm would be the price to portion ratio. My parents split the short ribs and when they were finished they were still kind of hungry. Be warned, if you want to be at least a little full, don't share an entre, the portions are pretty small. The place is also comparably expensive, all of these entrees nearly required a $20 bill or more. We thought the clipboard menus were a little tacky for a place of this caliber.I do like the farm-to-table concept, I also really admire and respect Big Grove's local sourcing of foods. My only constructive criticism would be to actually put where each dish comes from on the menu, such as:\"Grilled Pork Tenderloin - Farm XYZ: _____, IL\".As an avid organic and local food fan, adding this type of notation makes me feel much better than simply, \"local\". Common Ground Co-Op in Urbana does a fairly good job of  this.Overall, a very pleasant dinner on a gorgeous day.",

I ate here twice on a visit, once for lunch and once for dinner, and was initially struck by the sheer beauty--and size--of the restaurant. It gets crazy busy on a Friday night and appears to be the only upscale bar in the area.Recommended dishes: 1) Veggie mac and cheese2) Chili: cup or bowl, cornbread on the side3) Lake Trout (I don't even like trout--it's my least favorite fish, likely because I have only had river trout with the bones and almonds and butter, but this was sublime with horseradish sauce)4) Pate which rivals the best I've eaten and is my personal favorite because it's mousse-like and light and not too heavy/strong but still exquisitely flavorful: it's better than the chicken livers at the Public Kitchen at Hollywood and served almost identically at a far lower price5) Fried grits--I know, this doesn't sound good at all but it has a chipotle aioli and for a decadent fried treat, you can't do better. I didn't know much about grits, as an LA girl, but apparently you can cook them without much fat and then unceremoniously dump a big hunk of butter on top so that it's like cream of wheat with butter, or you can do it more like the French with butter and cream, in which case it's far worse for you but tastes infinitely better. Executive chef Jessica Gorin subscribes to the second school of grit preparation and I wholly approve. 5) Beets: they were as good as the Purple Pig in Chicago but this is a \"bar bite\" (see below) so if you want a large portion, order two. 6) Chocolate bread pudding: this dessert rivals the Olio e Limone chocolate bread pudding with bananas which Julia Child cited as among her favorite desserts in Santa Barbara7) Pork belly: this has become trendy of late and some restaurants are pulling it from menus in big cities as people seem to be over it to some extent but Big Grove Tavern hits it out of the park with this appetizer. 8) Burger: some people in the area carped about the price of the burger here, not realizing that this is standard in LA and NYC (actually, their burger is cheaper than most fine dining burgers in cities I travel or live) and it's sheer perfection with the onions and cheese. The prices are reasonable and they offer a sort of mini-appetizer they call a \"bar bite,\" for 3 to 5 dollars. This is a nice option as you can try all sorts of sides for not a lot of money. The watercress soup was beautiful and subtle but the only dish on the menu that didn't send me into another galaxy. I truly believe Big Grove Tavern would be a hit in a city. In Champaign, which is a college town that feels infinitely smaller than it really is, with very few fine dining options, I see why the place is booming and if I lived in this tiny place, I'd eat here three times a week.",

I am so happy that Champaign downtown has Big Grove Tavern! We sat at the bar for drinks and dinner. They had an excellent beer selection, with several Midwest and even some local brews and seasonal ones. The bartender was very helpful and attentive. The night we went, they had recently roasted an entire pig, so their specials were these amazing pork dishes. I enjoy pork quite a bit - beer and pork - since I've lived in Berlin and love German cuisine, so this place made me really happy. Based on my one visit, I'd recommend this place to all my friends and family, and anyone visiting from out of town.",

We were advised that if we didn't have a reservation we would be sitting outside or at the bar due to a 45 minute wait.  Note that at the time we arrived 80% of the tables inside were empty - no problem, we enjoy sitting outdoors.  Side note: forty-five minutes later there are still twelve empty tables inside...We enjoyed the cumin flavored popcorn and ordered a wedge salad to share.  The wedge salad needs a little help (extra crumbles please) but the bacon had a distinct full smokey flavor and was very good.  We requested salt and pepper and they brought it out in little stainless dishes.  My wife ordered the scallops and I ordered the flank steak.  The scallops (four) were exceptionally good - flavorful and delicious.  The cornbread was just ok.  The flank steak was marginal but ok - served with delicious sides.  The wine and beer list is solid - lots of good choices.Good table service - steak could have been brought out hot off the grill but can't have it all.  My wife was unimpressed overall - note the menu prices are high. The atmosphere is upscale overall and the food presentation is excellent.  The menu options are limited.  The music is questionably appropriate for dinner but not offensive.",

I've been in this college town for 7 years now and ate at most of the places here and this comes across as one of the worst. The waiter messed up the order, which I mean it happens. Then the steak comes out, and it was way too salty. The sauce was too salty as it is, and then they added sea salt on it. When I told my waiter about it, some manager lady in her 40-50s came and took it back to have it redone. She did not apologize but instead shrugged and said \"that's the way we cook it here\";  face was stone cold and gave us a new set of silveware without saying a word. Talk about customer service. I do not know how this place stays in business with a manager like this. Bottom line is, if you're looking for a quick eat, then the food here is ok, comparable to steak and shake quality but 3x the price. If you're unlucky enough like me to see that manager with an attitude, then you're in for an experience.",

Seriously, try the roast chicken. They also offer a selection of house cocktails that are very tasty. Prices are about on par with the other \"fancier\" restaurants downtown which is to say that you can easily get an entre and a drink for between $15 and $25. You can certainly spend more and if you try, you can get out for under $10 a head.The atmosphere feels relaxed and trendy, the decor is pretty awesome, and I have to say that I love their music selection. It's current and recognizable without being overplayed or desperately obscure. Big Grove is high on my list if I feel like having a nice dinner.",

I had the trout dish last time and was extremely disappointed with the tiny piece of fish in the center of the huge plate it was served on. Not much flavor, not satisfying. The only menu item I would recommend is the Tavern burger. The service here is soooo slow. I took my mom here when she was visiting last month, wanting to give this place another try since the restaurant overall does have a nice atmosphere inside compared to other nearby places. Unfortunately I was disappointed again. It took our waiter too long to greet our table and then again too long to bring us our drinks. I ordered a pecan beer that he had suggested and when I tasted the beer, it seemed a little off but I figured that was just the flavor of it. Our meal took about an hour and a half to come out...and all we had ordered was a burger and the free range chicken dish. I think our waiter had forgotten to put in our orders till later. The couple seated next to us after we arrived had their meals a half hour before we did. When the check arrived, I see that my beer was in fact a $10 cider, not a $5 beer. Guess my taste buds were right. We paid the bill and left without complaining because we didn't feel like being there any longer than we were. Look, I understand things go wrong in restaurants and the server can't always control how long food takes and mistakes can be made. I am a server so I've been there. But I would've appreciated it if our server tried to do something to make up for our lackluster experience here. Not coming back here.",

If it were less expensive; maybe more in line with Blackdog or Dublin O'Neils prices it may have gotten 4 stars (whereas those other restaurants get 5 stars and 4 stars respectively). We started off with some deviled eggs that were good, and a fresh baked pretzel that had an unappealing mustard sauce.  I'll take Gulden's over that mustard sauce any day.  I ordered the burger and my girlfriend ordered a chicken salad sandwich.The burger was actually pretty good, cooked medium, with an egg and some onion maramalade on it.  The fries were decent but nothing to write about.The chicken salad was just a terrible sandwich.  Maybe one small scoop of flavorless chicken salad on hard toast for $9?  Get that thing off the menu.  Seriously.  People who order that sandwich will not come back.   The sweet potato chips on the side were pretty tasty though.Overall, not as great as I had hear, though maybe the chicken salad ruined the experience.  You want a burger, go to Blackdog or Farrens for a comparable one that costs half the price.  Want chicken salad better than this, go to your local gas station and buy a pre-made chicken salad.All that said, I'll give it another try.",

If this place wants to make better business, I suggest they move to a location more visual from Route 45. On the other hand, I noticed a fellow yelper complain about the texture of the food but it was fairly consistent for my experience. Also, this location employees pretty young ladies, after all it is a college town. Ur welcome! ;) Only 3* for mediocre-ism",

The fries were cold which was a bummer because our food came out in like 5 minutes. Also the \"talent\" of this hooters is top notch, I feel like some hooters have gotten lazy with who they hire and I will say this one had a great group of friendly ladies. Expensive draft beer, plus they brought me a bud lite when I ordered a Budweiser but I know it's just so hard to keep those 2 straight.

Well once a very long time ago, when I attended the U of I, my roommate and I were eating lunch here on a weekday and in walks Harrison Ford.  Thats right, Han Solo/Indian Jones himself walks in, by himself and treats himself to the delicious Hooters cuisine.  There must of only been about 3 or 4 other patrons where, so it wasn't a big todo or anything.  That is totally random (there is a airport down the road, and Hooters was on of the first restaurants you see when you drive up from it towards town, so he was probably refueling or something).   So +1 star.So that aside, as a fried chicken review, I give Hooter's Chicken 4 stars.  The very thing that makes it unique you either love or hate,  Hooter's batters its chicken wings.  Hooters also leaves the \"tips\" on its wings too.  You can ask for them naked, but as its kind of the specailty of their wings I prefer the batter.  The batter does soak up a lot of sauce and oil, so it is by no means healthy.  It does keep ok, but its better reheated if you let it go cold.  Hooters sauces are notoriously non-spicey (and I'm a big wuss when it comes to spice).  \"Hot\" is about medium, \"medium\" is less than what is considered mild at most places, it has no flavor at all besides a buttery oilyness for some color.  Please order at least \"hot\", don't be afraid, its not hot.  The fried buffalo shrimp are pretty good too (but they go too quick).  Grilled cheese was favorite too, but some of these options are not offered as many Hooters are franchised.",

The place was quiet, only a few tables were full. Waitress was very kind and friendly, took our order promptly. When the food arrived, Mom got her soup along with her entree at the same time. By the time she finished her soup the entree was cold. No big deal, we thought, let's ask the waitress to re-heat. Unfortunately our waitress paid little attention to us and kept disappearing for long stretches. Eventually someone else reheated the entree for Mom. When the waitress brought the check she offered to box up our leftover dessert (huge portion). We thanked her and she took the cake away to be boxed ...and never returned.  I'd say 3 stars for food, 1 for service.",

She said she'd bring one right back, and then forgot (I watched her stand at the host stand, bored). Took 5 minutes to get one from waiter. This is the kind of thing you'd forgive as a fluke, but you watch and see table-waiting basics being flubbed all over the place. Last time, I watched *three* different customers standing up and approach a waiter stand asking to find their waiter. My service was slow, and didn't anticipate common needs (like a coffee refill at breakfast).My food came out partially cold and partially hot, which is either a kitchen timing issue or a tardy waiter who left food sitting in the window too long.Seeing as it doesn't seem to be one bad server, I'd guess this the result of poor training--which is usually a management issue.If you can survive the service, the hip/classy atmosphere has rich dark wood, orange lighting, and attractive window bays looking at Memorial Stadium on the south tip of campus. The menu items I've had have been either decent or great.Worth a try, I suppose, but bring patience.",

Based on my prior experiences, I knew to keep my expectations low.  Instead, I had a great time.  I came back a few days later and had another pleasant meal.  As far as chain restaurants go, Houlihan's ranks well above average.  I've skimmed the other reviews, and I can't be sure if I've just been lucky, but I certainly didn't suffer the problems of other customers (e.g., bland food, poor service).Lunch options are generously portioned and reasonably priced.  Complimentary soup or salad is served with entrees, sandwiches/wraps, and pizzas.  I've tried the baked potato soup and chicken tortilla soup and have trouble picking a favorite; both are savory and very thick/hearty.  If you're concerned about skimpy salads, each of the signature salads come with a healthy proportion of greens-to-\"toppings\" (candied pecans, Gorgonzola cheese, chicken, etc.).The tapas-style menu really makes this a fun spot for happy hour.  There are a LOT of options here (more than 40+), ranging in size from small to medium to entree-size.  You'll find something, even if you're a picky eater (and Houlihan's takes special consideration if you mention being gluten-intolerant, vegetarian/vegan, etc.).  I love being able to pick out a few things to share with friends, but I can also see this as a great option if you have a light appetite and want truly modest portions of rich mashed potatoes or filling pasta.  (Or if you have a diverse appetite and just want to eat bites of a lot of different things!)  You can get small, \"appetizer\"-sized portions of their mac-and-cheese (yum!), grilled skewers, asparagus salad, and white bean hummus (DELISH).  I eat hummus as an appetizer at many places, and while they vary in success, I found Houlihan's hummus with grilled pita to be plate-lickingly GOOD (surprising especially for a chain!).The other essential element for happy hour are drinks, and Houlihan's is stocked with a full bar, along with a menu of suggested cocktails.  Some of these drinks are more sophisticated, compared to the corn-syrupy messes you get served at most chain restaurants.  For women watching their weight, Houlihan's also serves a number of fruity drinks from the \"Skinny Girl\" brand (great for minimizing the damage that restaurants can do to your diet).",

                "review": "Houlihan's is kind of a pseudo fine dining version of a TGI Friday's.  The menu is similar to what I would expect from TGI Friday's, but the decor is a lot more trendy right down to the super obnoxious aluminum menus.  Although the menu items are fairly pedestrian, they have little twists (chevre on the bruschetta instead of the more expected mozzarella, for example) and there is a big focus on presentation.  This makes for wonderful looking food, but the taste doesn't quite hit the mark.  Some of the cool looking little food sculptures are also very difficult to eat.  My bruschetta came with a little minced olive tower that looked like a cross between a wine cork and something out of the cat box, which was none to appetizing.Most of the food I had tasted OK, but the fried asparagus stands out as being notably bad. One of my pet peeves is tough asparagus, and the stuff here was enough to make me go postal.  It was over breaded, over cooked, and the asparagus was actually chewy.  Gross.  I couldn't bite through the asparagus, so when I tried to eat it, the asparagus slid out of the breading leaving a pile of greasy panko straws on the plate.  The horseradish dipping sauce was good, but lacked zing.  At $10 for a dozen bad pieces of asparagus, this should definitely be skipped.As is usually the case with chains, the menu descriptions made the food sound divine but the taste did not live up to it.  It's not bad, mind you, it's just forgettable.  This was particularly the case with the \"mini desserts,\" which are actually full sized desserts; one is plenty for two people.  Thinking they were much smaller than they turned out to be, we got a $6 trio of pecan pie, banana cream pie, and chocolate cake.  All were very cold as if they had just been removed from a long stay in the fridge.  All were also very bland and had terrible texture.  The pies were both runny, and the chocolate cake was dry and made Hostess cupcakes look gourmet.  Like everything else, they looked fabulous, and were also very reasonably priced, but don't let that fool you.  They're really not worth it.  So overall, I give Houlihan's a resounding \"meh.\"  It's not bad, but I certainly didn't find it to be particularly good.  I'm giving three stars because the service was better than I would expect from a newer place so close to campus, and they definitely deserve credit for having such a well trained and capable staff.",

Personally, I thought it was overpriced for the quality and quantity of food received, and the service was lackluster at best.Five of us went after work for drinks; we didn't expect to have dinner, but we were all a little hungry, so decided to get a light fare before some went out to a party later that evening. I don't drink alcohol, so I ordered lemonade ($2.50, and it was just ok - not very tangy), and a cup of their potato soup, and house salad with blue cheese (each $3.95). I can't believe they don't have light French dressing......this is criminal.I was disappointed that the server couldn't keep the salad orders straight; unfortunately, two of us ordered salads with white dressings; her's ranch, mine blue cheese (since there was no French dressing!). The other gal had to serve as 'taste tester' to determine which salad had ranch and which had blue cheese dressing.For $11.26 (plus my decent tip since I'm not usually bitchy unless the service is really really bad!) I don't think I will likely return to Houlihans on my own free will. If however, someone really wanted to meet me there, I might go for the company and stop at McD's on my way home.",

I've always had good experiences at Houlihan's in other towns, so I was excited that Champaign was not only getting one, but that it would actually be located on the south side of town near my home instead of the urban blight that is North Prospect. But sadly, my experiences there have been haphazard at best. One time the food will be good and the service atrocious. Then the next, the service will be friendly (if not terribly professional or well-trained) and the food will just be downright BAD. I had a really exceptionally good lunch experience about a month ago--best server I've had in any Champaign restaurant in a LONG time--and the food was really good that day, too. (I'm sure this young lady would not take a plate out of the kitchen if it didn't meet her exacting standards, so I give her partial credit there, too). But then a couple of weeks later I stopped in with my son for lunch on a Sunday and had a pretty bad time of it. (The lettuce in my salad had been frozen and was limp. The iced tea had that 'old' oxidized taste. Blech. His burger was cooked to the consistency of a doorstop.). So sad. Consistency is what gains a restaurant success. And the chef and the front of house manager BOTH need to have incredible expectations and hold their people to that EVERY SINGLE DAY.  Furthermore, they need to train, train, train, and train so their people know what those expectations are and how they can meet them and exceed them. I'll keep going back, of course. I want this place to succeed. I want it to represent Champaign-Urbana to all the people who stay in the hotel or attend a conference or cheer on the Illini at a game. I have hope, because there is SO much potential. Houlihan's has all the ingredients to make a great, fun restaurant. They just need to have the right people putting together the recipe.",

We waited 30 minutes for our food and my filet was over cooked. It had no sear marks and appeared to be oven cooked. How do you mess up a steak? The tilapia was thickly crusted with something, with little specks of what may have been almonds. I asked to have my steak redone and to their credit they obliged, agreeing it was not done correctly. As my wife picked the mystery crust off her fish, my steak was redone. The second steak appeared promising (sear marks visible), but the cook obviously did not time or let the steak rest because this time it was rare (raw). Now I enjoy med rare bloody, but not cold raw steak. We had enough. Asked for a doggy bag and may give my dog a once in a lifetime treat.",

They then moved us to the bar area and sat us on 4 different round high top tables. Whatever, we can make that work.We all ordered our drinks and it took over 20 minutes for them to all be delivered. Mind you, many of us just ordered water to start with as we were going to be going out afterwards. 20 minutes is just insane to wait for water!Another 20 minutes goes by and our waiter (who's name I never caught) FINALLY came to take our orders. We knew it would take awhile for our food so we all sat and chatted. Food finally started coming out and as it came out he had no idea who ordered what, so we had to figure out what was on the plate and who ordered it. My food was alright, though at first it didn't come with the potato's that I ordered. Instead of just bringing me a side, he took my entire plate back and came back with mashed potato's very haphazardly placed on the side.One of our diners didn't get their food until almost everyone had already eaten. She ordered chicken tenders...they aren't that difficult to make!So up until this point we were all a bit peeved but could deal with it.The real disaster hit when he went to give us our tickets. Out of 15 checks, only 2 of them were right. He charged a pregnant lady 2 alcoholic beverages! It's not like he just gave her the wrong ticket, she was the only one that ordered what she got! So he just had no idea who ordered what.I got my check and it had an iced tea on it that I didn't order. He took my check to take it off and I didn't get a new check for another 30 minutes. I almost walked out without paying because we were getting tired of waiting, but I'm an honest person and I wouldn't have felt right leaving without paying.FINALLY the manager came out to assist him. Why wasn't she there the entire time? I have no idea! But she was about as much help as a log. She apologized, of course. But did we get any sort of compensation? Nope. She did decide to send the person that the party was in honor of a gift card to come back. Something tells me that gift card will go unused. I know I will never return to this establishment.Why was that poor waiter left on his own with a party of 15? Why didn't ANYONE help him? I saw at least 3 or 4 waiters pass by our table and not a single one of them thought that maybe he was struggling. Now, don't get me wrong...our waiter was about as personable as a stick in the mud, but still...we couldn't help but feel sorry for him, he obviously had no support from management.Get it together, Houlihan's. If you can't handle a 15 top, don't allow them. I doubt ANY of us will ever return to your establishment. And you really put a damper on what was supposed to be a really awesome night for our bride-to-be.",

Bartenders are not intentionally bad, but when it is obvious that management doesn't care, why should anyone else?Generic, frozen food that is just reheated when ordered.  Still, they manage to get grease fires.  Literally, came to the hotel to pick up a friend as I was going to a wedding.  We decided to have a drink before hand.  Everyone was evacuated because there was a grease fire in the kitchen.  Fire department shows up and quickly takes care of everything.  They let us back in to finish our drinks, but no food :)Have eaten here before that, and might as well just buy everything from the frozen section at Schnucks, and reheat.  It is the same thing.They do have Bell's on tap, but frozen pint glasses, and ice crystals form in the glass.  Yeah, don't know what the point of drinking frozen beer is?  Maybe the Macros have brainwashed people to think otherwise, but no reason to drink Bells Best Brown like that.For some reason a popular spot before an Illini game, and apparently a nice hotel.  Though one of my least favorite bars and restaurants in Chambana.",

I have had the SW chicken wrap, which mentions jalepenos, but I found it incredibly bland.  My dad liked his sandwich... but it was like ham and cheese with mixed greens, it's not that hard.The decor is cool, I just think the prices are a little bit ridiculous for the quality of food in Champaign.",

She actually got slower as lunch wore on although I only saw she had three tables to wait on.  We were there from 11:50 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. for lunch in a near empty restaurant.  Asked for our checks at 1:05 she said in a minute.  10 minutes later she brought them.  We waited another 15 and she never came back to run our cards.  We had to go to the hostess stand and get a manager to check us out.  The food isn't that good to give this another chance.  Won't go back, ever.",

I wandered around campus for a good hour looking for a place to enjoy a nice meal and glass of wine but had no luck near the college, so I came back to the hotel where I am staying. I wanted a steak but thought the 8 oz filet was a little pricey and large so I settled on the 4 oz filet (and subbed fries for a house salad for $2).  My steak was perfectly cooked and was served with a side of broccolini and a dab of buttery sauce for only $10!!  The 8 oz fillet is only $25 and comes with sides and a salad so that's not a bad deal either. I also had breakfast here this morning and was very satisfied with my scrambled eggs and bacon. I would definitely recommend this place. I know it's my first review, but it's legit. :)",

My waiter had no knowledge of the menu and seemed to be quite new. He should not have been on his own. The food was of a poorer quality that one would expect from a fast food restaurant, though the prices said otherwise. The service form the waiter was poor from start to finish, and I never once got a refill on my drink. Next time I stay at the hotel, I will definitely be driving elsewhere to dine. There are so many other great places in Champaign, that it would be a shame to waste time and money here. Avoid at all costs.",

We waited around for at least five minutes before flagging another server down to finally get a table.  I also gotta say, the drinks here (besides the long islands) are expensive!  They're about twice as expensive as other/nicer Houlihan's I've been to.  It must be because it's connected to the hotel.  Anyways, the food was hit and miss.  My bf ordered the panko shrimp.  Everything was perfect and delicious except for the coleslaw, which was like shredded cabbage and mayo that had been mixed two seconds before so it wasn't marinated at all.  I had the seared sea scallops.  Sadly, the scallops were more like bay scallops.  Pretty tiny in comparison to the same entree I got at a different location a few days earlier.  At least they were perfectly cooked, since the risotto was a fail.  It was starchy and unappetizing.  Needless to say, I doubt I will be returning to this location though Houlihan's is one of my favorite restaurant chains.",

You also had the choice to toast white or whole grain bread (2 pieces were left), and add butter and or jelly.  The selection of beverages were regular coffee (not hot and no decaf), water, orange and apple juice.  The silverware was in short supply, 2 forks and no knifes, but plenty of spoons.  Upon me asking if they were going to replenish the table, they said yes and added more scones, pound cake to the \"pastry\" plate and fruit cups.  No other rectifications.  The first booth I sat at, the table was all sticky as though they wiped the table with syrup on the rag.  The second table was still sticky, but not nearly as bad.

The location is in a strip mall located on Green Street. The are actually 2 separate storefronts. So we we looked in the hooka bar part and there were 6 people sitting in 1 booth hooka-ing. We went into the larger facility which was a bar. The worst bar I have ever been  in. Run down and shabby. Paint peeling off the walls. 3 booths all looked in need of a good cleaning and repair. I would like to say we were greeted by a bartender (or at least I think she was) who was sitting on a bar stool with her legs on another eating something that wasn't made there because \"Cafe\" is a joke. They didn't sell any food. She only spoke when I asked her where the cafe portion of the bar was. This is where she told us that they didn't serve food. We werr waiting for the rest of our party to arrive so we ordered diet sodas that tasted like pure carbonation. Lastly, I went to use the restroom but it was too dirty to use. This place was a huge disappointment for all of us. Overlooking the fact that they say they are a cafe, the staff failed in many ways.",

We had to switch hoses three times, each looking worse than last. We ended up with a hybrid of dirty cloth, disintegrating velvet, and duct tape, which provided a mood-setting lung-full of dust on first use.It gets one star because it's the only place on campus you can buy (low-quality, quick-light, chemical-laced) charcoal after the head shops close. Last I checked it was $2/roll. You can also buy small quantities of molasses, so it's a means of exploring flavors before investing in one (which you should buy online).The other star is for the staff that is (or tries to be) helpful. I think most of the blame goes on the owner who can't seem to understand the need to stock your menu's offerings or investment in new equipment. Staff could do a better job cleaning/maintaining the hookahs.",

The bar has undergone a change in ownership and management, a remodel, and the hookah and alcohol are now separate. The drinks are inexpensive and very strong. (They aren't joking when they call them Stron Islands!) They have 2 dart boards and 2 pool tables for the game-oriented, and new booths for those who aren't. My favorite night to go to Green Street is Tuesday. They have Outlaw Karaoke--the same awesome karaoke DJ who does White Horse Wednesday nights, but without the flooded bathrooms. Bud and Miller family bottles are only $2, and Mikey and Dan have a whole list of signature drinks if you're not into beer. Overall, Green Street is a great place to grab a drink, any night of the week.",

Much lower key than Legends, Murphy's has the unique feel of being open to anyone willing to take a step out of their dorm roomsYou can't call your bar-hop night a barcrawl if you don't stop here. The food is good, the drinks cheap, and the people are always merry in Murphy's. I will miss every night I've remembered, or forgotten here.",

The place caters to the average college-aged individual who is content to fraternize with his or her colleagues over inexpensive alcoholic beverages and greasy diner food. While classier than the average campus-town bar, Murphy's by no means rivals the sophistication of the surrounding bars of downtown Champaign and Urbana. Classically, Murphy's tends to be more popular among the graduate and older undergraduate students, but that doesn't deter alumni and non-student patrons from frequenting. The beer selection outmatches any other bar on the University of Illinois campus and it is a bargain cost-wise compared to the non-campus bars. Food is typically served until 11 p.m. each night, with one of the most popular dishes being the \"Irish Nachos\" - essentially a whole plate of waffle fries decked with nacho toppings that you'll need a friend or two to finish. A host of burgers and other fried foods are also available with various specials throughout the week.  I have nothing but the fondest memories of Murphy's Pub. There's nothing ritzy about it, but if you're open to having (or reliving!) a fun yet relaxing college night, Murphy's is the place for you!",

I don't mind my Blue Moon but somedays I want something a little more interesting than the usual suspects. If you are going to be around for awhile, learn about when the specials occur (Mug nights, half off bacon cheeseburgers, etc.). If you want to carry a casual meeting, this is a good location for lunch. The late afternoon and evening hours will be a little louder.",

Love this place, totally low-key bar where you just sit, have a few beers and talk with friends.  \"Older\" crowd here too (compared to like Kams or Clybourne - is that still there?)  They also have a juke box, I don't know how many times we loaded Madonna songs :)  On my 21st bday we stayed til close, and they said on the PA \"it's closing time, but we'll let the jukebox keep playing because it's not Madonna\"Food is pretty good too, we'd go when the bacon cheeseburgers were on special - OMG so yummy and incredibly greasy.  They also have loaded waffle fries that are awesome.",

This place is on campus so it easily fills up with  large groups of drunken college kids during the week when school is in session. I've witnessed one of said kids puking in their cup as they attempted to take a drink. If it's a weekend, the youngins usually find plenty of parties to attend so that's less of a problem, unless its moms or dads weekend where it can fill up just as quickly. They don't even serve their regular menu on nights like this which can be frustrating if you forget about campus life from time to time. We stopped in last night during spring break for some $2.50 specialty pints and irish nachos and life was good.",

We also ordered shots separately and each shot was $2 for 0.5 fl oz. I was stunned. I have not really ventured to campus bars in my three-and-a-half years here because I consistently have bad experiences. 0.5 fl oz for a shot is the next level of low. Most campus bars at least pretend to not be totally lost and call 1 oz a shot... But 0.5 just leaves me speechless. Standard shot, you guys, is 1.5 fl oz. Nowhere else have I seen a recipe for mixed drink with an 8 to 1.5 mixer to liquor ratio. That's basically spiked Sprite. My point is, they have -1000 drink craftsmanship. Which is fine since apparently you're supposed to lower your standards on campus. But what really gets me is that they sell 0.5 oz dribbles of liquor and call it a shot... Food: Food service is poor though the food is fairly good. We waited an unusually long time for two burgers. We began to think something was wrong so we peeked into the kitchen (after asking a server and having to wait more) and it looked like the cook was cooking away... And then he ate the food. I get it... If I were working all night I'd get hungry too. But it's kind of strange delaying orders for an absurdly long time so that the cook can prepare and eat food from scratch.",

We used to come for Mug Night on Wednesdays so this place brings back great memories.It's been 8 years since I've been here, so I was really surprised when the food and beer was actually better than I remembered!  First of all, I already mentioned their beer on tap. it's quality and fresh! and low cost. Secondly, their burgers still rock in an awesome way! I had their Turkey burger while my friends had the regular cheeseburgers. Man oh man these burgers are juicy and seculent. The turkey burger is well flavored and succulent.  We basically scarfed down our meals including the yummy fries. Another good thing is that they also expanded this place - it used to be way too crowded but they added a whole other section to this place. They have a nice layout with table sizes that comfortably accomodate anywhere from 4 to parties in the teens. I love their spacious bench seat tables. If you're visiting U of I, definitely hit up this place! It's a cherished favorite.",

Arcade machines, Pool tables, Dirty bathrooms, Picnic style tables....and $2 beers.I was here on business and decided to stop in for a drink.  I came in on a Thursday so perhaps it was a special day, but all their drafts (And they had a surprisingly good list for a college bar) were $2.  What a deal!A few people in the group ordered food and said it wasn't bad.  I cannot vouch or review the food as I did not partake.  From seeing the burgers, they looked pretty decent actually.  The process of ordering food was interesting.  There are no servers.  You go up to the food window, put in your order and give a name.  They then call your name over a PA system to the whole bar.  The speakers from this PA system sound like they came from the 70s when all you hear is squelching noise.  We pretty much looked over at the food window to see if it was us anytime the garbled noise came over the speakers.All in all this place is a dive.  If you want this type of thing, go for it!  If you want something a bit more upscale with servers and non-bar food, try somewhere else.  Personally, I'll be back for the cheap beers next time I am in town!",

If you get a booth, it's a good place to chill out, play card games, indulge in some greasy-ness and hang with friends.

For example, the last time I was there, I ordered Irish Nachos without bacon (because I'm vegetarian). The order (which is just fries with cheese and nacho toppings) took an hour. Once I got my order, it had bacon on it but I didn't send it back because I was so sick of waiting. Regardless to say, it definitely ruined the night to spend an hour hungry and waiting on food and then having to pick all of the bacon off.",

It's a very chill bar but at the same time can be crazy fun with some great music and good company. The jukebox there is always a fun way to get the night going and they always have a huge selection of songs to choose from. Also, it's the place to be these days on Thursday nights, as the lines can get insanely long and have up to 30-40 min wait times depending on the night. So my advice to you would be to arrive around 9pm-9:30pm to avoid any lines, cause as soon as 10 o'clock rolls around, you'll be waiting a little bit to get in.The specials are always nice, with the $7 killians on Thursday and $2 Pints for Bluemoon, how could you go wrong? Also, with the new area that opened up, the wait for drinks has gone down to much shorter. Love the new space and the addition of the air-hockey table in the basement as well. In addition, the food is delicious! Best burgers and fries on campustown. The double-cheeseburger deal on Wednesdays (i think, might have to check on this) is amaziiinnnng.  Overall, this bar is chill and fun at the same time. It's not as chill as Legends (granted Legends may have more seating) but I don't think you'll get the same experience when comparing the bars.",

I was excited to see that they had spicy cheese bites which thrilled me because growing up in Wisconsin consuming cheese curds while at the bar is a must. These were a rendition of the cheese curd but a very sub par one. The cheese inside was not hot enough so the cheese didn't squish out when eating them, it just kind of stuck to the breading. Next off, I had the burger. I ordered the mushroom burger which was the Tuesday special. When I got my burger it had no mushrooms on it and the cheese was barely melted. The topping such as the pickles, lettuce, tomato, and onion were fresh. The fries were mediocre at best. Coming in at 1:15 in the afternoon I didn't expect the place to have a big crowd but it was far too quite; No music was even playing.",

Food is pretty good but sometimes its hit and miss. i've had great irish nachos and i've had terrible irish nachos there. SERVICE IS TERRIBLE they are incredibly rude. 1st examplestanding at the bar watching a football game holding my money out on the counter so bartender knows i want a drink. next thing i know the bartender is in my face \"waving your money around wont get you served faster\". What the hell, i was standing there holding it on the bar, i wasn't even looking at you i was watching tv. 2nd examplecrowded for unofficial so i'm sure they are stressed. close out my tab, paid with a credit card but was going to leave a cash tip. Still reaching for my wallet bartender looks at 50 dollar tab with no tip. \"hey buddy, thats really a jerk thing to do, thanks\" again, what the hell! can i reach in my wallet to give you the cash, needless to say i said yeah your right and left without tipping. 3rd exampleusually the irish nachos are covered in toppings, most recent time hardly any. go back up to counter, its sunday no one is there so its not like its busy. Can i get some more toppings please i didn't get very much. Guy looks at me like i just punched his mother. answers slowly \"yeah... i guess i can\". he was pissed. Dude calm down i just want more toppings, didn't say it was terrible, get over yourself. thank god i love this place. except the servers. and not all are bad, just most.",

Not fantastic but solid and you gotta get the Irish Nachos to split with a few friends. The food can take a while to come out, especially if they're busy, so just be patient. The best nights at Murphy's are Wednesdays and Thursdays.Wednesday is logo night so you can grab a pint and keep the glass for under $5 and refills are only $2.50 I think. Phenomenal deal. My cabinets are full of awesome logo glasses thanks to Murphy's. Thursdays are phenomenal because it's $2 pints. Any pint for just $2. You'll never beat that. I hear they may have upped it to $2.50 but that's a good variety of decent quality pints for just $2.50. Go out with a $10 bill and you'll have an awesome night. That simple, that's all you need.",

It's a divey atmosphere so they almost never have cover (only on Homecoming weekend and the like) and the vibe is very relaxed. Old school high top tables and wooden booths have been etched and written on until there's very little left of the original finish, but that's half the fun. They have great drink specials and amazing Irish nachos! I was feeling so nostalgic on my last visit here that I ended up coming two nights in a row. This is definitely the best bar on campus, hands down.",

All the seats have names and years carved into them, and the walls are covered in beer memorabilia. The food is pretty good for Campustown; I like the burgers and fries. They're appropriately greasy, and when on special you can't beat the price. The chicken fingers leave something to be desired but, hey, it's not perfect.What you go to Murphys for is the beer. The draft list is surprisingly extensive, and while the selection of hard alcohol is weak (says the guy who's finished a whiskey passport at Seven Saints), the specials are fantastic (you can normally get a double of either Beam or Wild Turkey for $5 or less) and they have specialty pints for $2.50 on Thursdays. And it's not bad beer either. I normally get Fat Tire or Angry Orchard, but they even have some decent IPA's on tap (sayeth my beer snob friends). Murphy's is often crowded, and for graduate students, there's a very real risk of running into students, but it's my favorite place in Campustown and a really good bar overall.",

Wednesday is Logo Glass Night, and I have several boxes of the great glasses I accumulated over the years.Their beers on tap is great, especially for a campus bar.  The food is pretty good pub grub, but I believe there is a \"game-day menu\" where only certain things are served, which is kind of a bummer if you want Irish nachos on game-day because it's not on the menu.  The jukebox is great (every fricking song by The Black Keys can be found on there) and there are loads of flat screens to catch whatever game is on.

You go in and order at the bar, and then walk to the back where they prepare your order to pick it up.There's usually no cover here at night (with the exception of special occasions such as Unofficial, Mom's/Dad's weekend, etc.) and have good, knowledgeable bartenders.  There's a wide selection of beers - over 25 I believe? - and they make a kickass Amaretto Sour (my fav next to Irish Car Bombs, btw, so you should buy me one if you see me out at the bars ever ^__~, they're like a Starburst in a glass!).  Like all the other bars, this place gets quite crowded on weekends and as everyone else here has commented on, the jukebox is loud and, at $1 a song, gets heavy use/abuse.  Some of the stuff that comes out of that thing... I don't know, man... =PThe specials here are also pretty sweet - yay for logo glass night.

It was a sunday and we wanted to catch the NFL games so, naturally, we went up to a bar. Murphy's was our 3rd choice (after the other 2 bars were either closed or not showing any games). The place was empty (not surprising coming from a college town where all they care about is Saturday Football) except for a couple of old guys talking to themselves.They had a lot of TVs and only one game on, when we asked them to switch it they couldn't because they didn't own the football package -strike one-Despite the place being deserted our server never took our order and we had to go up to the bar to have them take it. There is some controversy about this, as some bars will have you do that in the early evening but I've been to bars in the middle of nowhere at the same time where this wasn't the case. Either way, that was a bit annoying, so strike two.Strike three came along when after ordering we had to pick up our own food at the kitchen. At that point we gave up on good expectations and simply sat down to watch the game.The good news is their food is amazing. My friend and I are no fans of fries either but man they were awesome! And their bean burger was gigantic and extremely good according to my friend, while I had the steak sandwich and that was absolutely perfect.In any case, chances are the place is legit on Saturday Game Day, but it's up to you if you want to try it out.",

The tables are all carved by patrons trying to leave their mark on Green Street. Irish nachos come in huge servings. It's all good, but not really outstanding. I also feel like this place goes through an identity crisis with its loud blaring music that can shift from club music to country music (electronic jukebox-style). Don't come here if you expect to watch a sports event of some sort, but if you're looking for a place to drink and only drink, Murphy's will do.",

The inside is pretty big, there's a few different rooms and even a downstairs that we didn't get a chance to check out.We shot a few games of pool and were able to have decent conversation due to the music being at an actually reasonable volume. They had several drink specials, I was able to get a Harp for $2.50 and McGillicudy shots were only $2 also. I'll have to come back when the Guinness is on special (if it ever is).The only thing I wasn't too happy about was the service. It was quite slow. It seemed like they were a little understaffed. Our bartender was good once he got around to us, but perhaps the place was a little more crowded than usual?Either way, a good time and I'll definitely be back.",

I'm in!) to great food (I'm looking at you, Irish Nachos) to the atmosphere, you can count me in as a fan. The expansion has made it much easier to walk around the bar on the weekend nights when everyone is cramming in. Finding seating is less of a rat race, but I'd still say to arrive earlyish if you don't want to be standing.  The bathrooms can get a little sketchy, but I pretty much expect that from a campus bar. The jukebox has some interesting selections, and the music is usually good overall. It's my current favorite place to go and hang out with friends while not spending loads of money at the same time.",

The more people you can fit in the bar, the shorter the line outside!  I haven't had food here in years, but I know it's super cheap.  Drinks are cheap too, decent draft beer selection for a campus bar, and it's surprisingly not that hard to snag a table (there are a whole bunch of them).  I've had many an evening here, dancing in that space in front of the jukeboxes.  And you should know that this is not a place where a lot of people dance - it's mostly just people drinking, probably shaking their heads and laughing at my friends and I dancing around like idiots to Bon Jovi.  But you know, Murphy's just makes me feel comfortable enough to do that.  The jukebox blows on busy nights though - even if you pay extra for \"play next,\" like 10 other people already did that so you might not hear your songs at all.  And you'll probably have to sit through a lot of stupid crap that other people picked out before you get to any good music.  I guess it just depends on the crowd.  Either way, we always stop at Murphy's when we come back to Champaign and I know we always will!",

A long bar, some tables up front, and bar games like pool and shuffleboard towards the back.  A beer garden that has hosted plenty of bands.  Anybody from the Boat Drunks to Tons of Fun Band.  Plenty of TV's that put a premium on Illini sports.  I will always remember watching the Illinois/Arizona NCAA game during the 04-05 season here.  Service suffers depending on how many people are here, and what is going on.  Food has always been generic pub grub, but just slightly better food than a dive bar should have.Always a fun time.  A place that should at least be given a try, and if it is not for you, there are always plenty of other spots around town.",

The menu consists of simple, classic pub food that has been prepared exceptionally well.  They don't offer anything fancy, but they use high-quality ingredients and prepare it competently.  On Fridays, they offer a beer-battered fish sandwich that simply has to be tasted to be believed.  I would walk a mile on my lips for one of their fish sandwiches and would love to see it on the regular menu.  Skip's grilled cheese is another favorite, but don't expect the kids' classic sandwich as this is a grown-up version with three kinds of cheese, tomatoes, and bacon.The service is extremely friendly and generally quite competent.  Another reviewer reported some bad experiences with service on the two occasions on which he had visited, but I've had nothing but exemplary and friendly service, and I've been going there regularly for many years (both before they closed and again after they re-opened).  I will routinely order carry out lunch with a group of friends; and yes, there have been some minor mix-ups on our order.  But we order from a lot of different places for carry-out or delivery, and they have done better than every other restaurant in town in accuracy, and we typically order anywhere from 4-12 entrees.  On those rare occasions when something was messed up, they corrected it immediately, cheerfully, and then didn't charge for the messed up orders.  ALL restaurants have bad days when everything seems to go wrong, and they handle theirs better than most.They have a well-stocked bar and an excellent beer list; I don't drink wine all that often any more, so I keep forgetting to check out the wine list.  I don't go to Fat City to drink or hang out, but when I've stayed there to eat, the sound system has been perfectly fine.  Also, the restrooms are clean and well lit.  I've never had to wait for a drink, and when I'm drinking iced tea or soda, my glass has never been allowed to hit empty before I get a free refill.  I frequently go to Fat City for lunch, often making a separate trip from Mahomet where I live just to eat there.  As the name would imply, I wouldn't go there if I were on a strict, low-fat diet; but if you want excellent, no-frills pub food, this place is awesome.",

                "review": "Never again. This is a terrible place for anybody looking to enjoy themselves. If having fun is not your thing, check out Fat City.My second time here confirmed in spades the general feeling of badness I got the first visit. The first time (~a year ago) was a weekend night and they had a lot of people. All the garbage that comes with a large, half and half campusy crowd was there that time. They had keg service outside in a busted little shed (plastic cups, long lines, beer foam splashing all over, and a full compliment of asshats). Inside, the place doesn't *look* that bad. They have dark wood accents, a selection of booths, tables, and a long bar. They have 2 nice pool tables, a shuffle puck table (you dont have to pay for the machine to keep score ... there's an app for that now), a new golden tee, and a couple of other games that looked playable. The second time I went was a Tuesday night. I realize Tuesday is a polarizing night for bars, but I am solidly in the camp of lovers of bars on the empty side. A group of grad students I run with had called ahead letting the place know we would be coming en masse. Many of this crew refused to come, (I surmise based upon how terrible this bar is). So we had about 80 less people there than we warned them about ahead of time. So the service was great, right? Nope. The worst I've experienced in Champaign-Urbana. Drinks took literally 20 minutes. One bartender with ADHD had \"a system\" for remembering what everybody had was running around like a chicken with his head cut off. The guy was really trying, but he did not do his job efficiently at all: he would ask you what you wanted, listen to the very first thing you said, then turn away and 'get right on it' before you were done talking. He would then stop preparing your drink order mid-way to take care of somebody else and their extended family. He would then serve up your drink and act like you were the jerk because you wanted two additional drinks. Those three drinks will cost you $9 plus 20-35 minutes of your life. This 'system' led to a half-dozen or more people at any given time stuck in the purgatory between ordering a drink(s), receiving said drink(s) and paying for same.The music system sucks. A really muddy sound that makes old standards hardly understandishable, and the bar artificially loud. In the nearly empty bar described above, it was hard to hear even those near to you, and doubly hard to communicate with the bartender. It was easier to hear elsewhere, but they must put the speakers over the bar (so the bartender can't hear complaints?).The food sucks. Terrible selection of boring pub grub standards of BBQ'd meat, fried meat, crappy frozen crinkle cut fries. On Tuesday, they have $2.00 margaritas that are TERRIBLE. Bottom-shelf tequila plus too-much bottom shelf margarita mix over ice (no blend option).Oh yeah, there is an old guy sitting at the end of the bar talking loudly to himself. The aforementioned sound quality makes this even creepier, as only occasional strains of his soliloquy find their way through the muddy garbage music they play here (Classic Rawk 2 steps below NOW!). I really thought about giving this place 2 stars for the following reasons: $4 bottles of good beers, (like Rogue Dead Guy and Bell's Oberon) and a shuffle puck table/new Golden Tee. Pre-Yelping the place in my head I was resigned to give them 2 stars as a recognition of such efforts, even if they were not reflected in positive results. Then my buddy got his Blue Moon draft in a plastic cup.",

I really liked the atmosphere of the bar. It was a great place to watch the game I think next time but will just go for drinks since I didn't think the food was so great. I ordered the salmon slider and the salmon was so salty it was inedible. The other slider I ordered was okay nothing to rave about but the worst was the California turkey burger my friend ordered. The menu said it had avocado on it which it did but it was such a minuscule amount we literally cracked up about it.Its a clean bar and quiet enough to watch a game AND still hear the commentary but you might want to eat before you get there though.",

The slider was a little dry for me, but the salad was very good! Our server was very friendly and quick, and the location is perfect if you work near downtown Champaign.

The staff were friendly and knowledgeable both times, and they were eager to help suggest drinks to try.  The cocktails were tasty, although a little on the strong side for my tastes.  When we had a party too large for the tables in front, they gladly opened the back room for us to all sit at the same table.The sliders were good, the soup was hot and tasty, and I really enjoyed the casual atmosphere of the place.  I'm glad I'll be going back for my bf's after work outings.",

It's also the place I recommend when people from out of town ask where they should go for dinner. The service there is very friendly and prompt, and the food is good. I've never had the salmon burgers, but I wouldn't expect the fish dishes to be the best in the heart of Central Illinois anyway. The Buffalo Chicken Slider and Classic Slider with Cheese are my favorites, along with a side of waffle fries (although if you're a fan of sweet potato fries, they have the best in town). The chipotle ranch sauce that comes with the onion rings is amazing, the tomato bisque is absolutely out of this world and they have a great selection of whiskey and beer at the bar. I really think of this place as more of a restaurant than a bar though. They tend to get busy on Friday and Saturday nights, and if the wait is long, make sure you're back earlier than you think if you decide to walk around the area. Definitely one of the gems in Champaign-Urbana and a place that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good meal at a decent price.",

                "review": "This restaurant/bar is conveniently located in downtown Champaign. We sat down around 6PM on a Sunday Night for dinner.Appetizer: Get the half order of pretzels. I believe this is a new menu item which comes with 2 giant soft pretzels, mustard for dipping, and an amazing jalepeno cheese sauce. The pretzel was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of salt. I could have eaten a bowl of that jalepeno cheese sauce.Main course: I love it when restaurants allow you to combine menu items, like any variety of a soup/ salad/ sandwich combo. At SS, you can definitely create a combo to your liking. I ordered the soup with half sandwich. The price and quality just blew my mind. You think a tomato bisque soup is boring? Seven Saints will change that opinion of yours! I got that tomato bisque soup with half a tuna melt sandwich and i was in food heaven.Dessert: It's very rare that I have room in my stomach for an appetizer, main course, and dessert. Well, I didn't have room, but that didn't stop me from ordering a sweet sensation. The blueberry cheesecake with ginger crust was absolutely incredible, and I don't regret that decision one bit.Service: Impeccable. I ordered an arnold palmer to drink, and I never saw the bottom of my glass. The food was prompt and our server was helpful. Even with the packers vikings game on TV, we had an extremely pleasant time.I know Illinois is known for good food, but man, I was not expecting this amazingness :) A++++++",

I typically came here on a date with the wife when she visited me during graduate school. We had to live separately for two years but enjoyed our evenings here before her flight home out of CMI. Although it's a whisky bar, they had an interesting selection of wine and beer. I always got the Mojo IPA and she got her Riesling. Aside from the relationship, this is also where I came to prefunk with the roommate before our Thursday night pubcrawls with the School of LER. Initially, my first roommate introduced me to this place when I first arrived to Champaign. We were paired by Burnham's roommate matching system. He was this smart computer science whiz. We drank here on weekends. He moved on to work for Skype. My second roommate was a Korean born Mexican. He was fluent in Spanish which culturally, he loved whisky. I think I was appointed as his wingman because he was this strange kimchee taco hybrid that was soaked in whisky that came off as a creeper. The Chinese Beijing girls loved him though and our strategies to get him laid all started here at Seven Saints. The irony is that, there was nothing Saint like going on at this establishment when we were there.",

I was even more hopeful when my friend and I walked in. The design of this place is awesome. It's really nice looking with good lighting. It looks trendy and cool. Unfortunately, it's an illusion to cover up the rest of the place. It's a pretty boring menu. It's American cuisine that focuses on slider-sized sandwiches. I had the fried chicken slider, and it was okay. Pretty much just literally fried chicken on a bun. It's not any better than I could have gotten at a fast food place, and for much cheaper. I wish I could have tried more sliders, but we were stopping in before a concert, so it was what it was. It's the kind of restaurant that is made to look like it's trendy but it's really just a normal joint with a nice paint job and design to it, and the ambiance isn't worth the extra price in my opinion. The food isn't bad, just average. What really brings this rating down for me is the staff. The service is absolutely terrible. First of all, it was so slow. We ordered one slider each, it shouldn't take that long, especially when the restaurant is packed. Not only was our waitress slow, but she was unbelievably rude. The friend that I went with is male. I, obviously, am female. I might as well have not existed. All of the questions, flirtations, \"are you okays?\" were directed at him, and when I said anything, I got an eye roll and a curt nod. I get it. Guys will probably tip you better. But that's no reason to just blatantly be a terrible server, because we obviously came in together, so you should probably be nice to us together. He was embarrassed for both of us, and made a point to try and ask me questions in front of her, but she just was not getting the hint. It was awkward for both of us, and helped to ruin an otherwise lovely evening out. I'd try this place again maybe if I'm ever in the neighborhood again, but I'd definitely be careful about in whose section I was seated. The second star of this review is for atmosphere alone.",

Finally my co-workers decided to make this the weekly spot to go out to eat, so I was more than happy to tag along.  We went around 12 noon, on a weekday.  The inside is pretty cozy and nicely decorated.  It's almost imperial looking with the large hanging drapes as curtains.  We had a large group of 10, and fortunately we were able to get a table.  The place itself seems very large, as there were from what I could tell, 3 distinct areas to sit in, and an outside dining area as well.All and all though, the place came across as very average to me once everything was said and done.   Granted the restaurant was pretty busy, it took our server literally 15 minutes to come get our order, and another 15 to just get our drinks (and most of us just had water).The food did not take too long to come out, but once again I wasn't impressed at all.  I got the club sandwich with waffle fries, and I can't say it was bad at all, but there was just not a thing special about it.  It's your typical greasy fare typee of place too... Fries oozing grease, bread and buns slathered with butter, etc.  I also tried some of the cheese curds (sounds disgusting, but quickly found out it's just like a round mozerella stick), waffle fries, sweet potato fries, and a classic slider (which apparently is what they are known for... sliders that is)  All of it was just very average, and even the acclaimed slider was nothing special.  I would probably not go here again if I had the choice, but other than I long wait to get waited on and an even longer one to get some drinks, there is really nothing too major I can dock the restaurant for other than it just did not appeal to me much personally.  I should note our server was very friendly, but I just can't really get into the food.  Just a very average joint.",

                "review": "This is one of my favorite local restaurants in CU. First of all, the atmosphere is really amazing. A lot of care was taken to make the inside of this place something special. It has a slightly dark, gothic feel yet it still feels very cozy and inviting. I do wish the space was a bit bigger, however, as it can get busy very quickly and you'll run out of places to sit.Service-wise I've almost always had great service. The wait-staff is friendly and the bartenders are fast and responsive. They have a nice selection of spirits. The best part has to be the food, though. They have a nice selection of salads. My absolute favorite is the Seven Saints Salad. I've never tasted anything quite like it. It has a crisp bed of greens topped with tiny hot green peppers and a VERY generous portion of pieces of steak. The steak is flavorful and moist and the whole salad has a clear dressing that compliments the other components perfectly. The best part is that you can have the salad as part of a special served with a couple of their sliders for around $8. It's a great deal.Speaking of their sliders, they have a really wonderful selection of mini-hamburgers. They aren't as heavily greasy as you might expect from a traditional slider. My favorites are probably the Asian slider with it's wasabi spread, the Buffalo Chicken slider (with an amazing sauce on a crispy piece of chicken and served with ranch dip) and the Blacjack burger. There are a ton more and pretty much anything to suit your taste.Another standout aspect of Seven Saints are their appetizers. If I have one complaint it's that they seem incapable of keeping their Beet Chips ready to order. Out of the five times I've tried to order them, I've only ever been able to get them twice. I don't know if I've just had bad timing or what but I do wish they were a bit more diligent with those. If you do manage to order them they are delicious and are served with a yummy goat cheese dip. If they are out of them, there are still a lot of great options. You can't go wrong with either of their mushroom appetizers.",

I was told they were famous for their sliders, so I chose the Chicago Dog slider, mainly because I love Chicago Dogs and also because it was out of the ordinary. The slider was very good, but a little overpriced. Not wanting to fill up on just sliders, I also got the Chipotle salad which was very well done and was tasty and surprisingly filling for a salad. I enjoyed the atmosphere- relaxed with good music playing. The waiter was friendly, but not very attentive, especially considering it was not that busy. I had to ask several times just to get a refill on my water. I often judge a place by asking myself if I would go back again.  For Seven Saints, the answer would be yes, if I happened to be in the area, but I wouldn't go way out of my way to get there.",

One of our favorite things to do together outside of work is drive over to Seven Saints for Whiskey Wednesday and just start buying each other rounds of amazing, 1/2-off whiskey.  1/2-off whiskey alone is worth 5 stars to me, but what really puts Seven Saints over the top are their amazing sliders.  They have about 8 or so different kinds and since they're relatively small you can comfortably have 2-3 of them in one meal.  Top that off with some waffle fries and ranch dressing and I'm the happiest camper.",

It's just.. it's so good. I've always been a ribeye steak fan, and in my teens when I first learned they make sandwiches out of them, I think I cried tears of joy. Ever since my first bite, I've been on the hunt for the next best ribeye sandwich.. and my friends, I search no more.I order mine blackened, medium-rare, with their delicious waffle fries. The first time I decided on this sandwich, I didn't have high expectations. I had ordered sliders here in the past and found them just okay. However, when they brought out my huge, melty, tender, delicious sandwich, I could hear the angels singing. It was GLORIOUS. I ate every single bite, and within 2 days I found myself back at Seven Saints, ordering another. This is my all time favorite steak sandwich, and I order it often.Aside from this amazing sandwich, the service is always good and the atmosphere is friendly and inviting. They even have ginger ale on tap, YES! Anytime I've been less than 100% satisfied, the staff has been completely accommodating and has removed any problem item from the bill, AFTER replacing it for me. I couldn't have better things to say about this establishment!",

                "review": "This is another bar/restaurant in downtown Champaign. They are going for a more upscale look than say the Blind Pig or Mike 'n Molly's. Everything is very clean, and spotless. There is a wood bar and lots of tables and booths abound. Again, very nice and clean. Not a lot of character, but enjoyable.The quality is fine. Nothing wrong with the taps or bottles. The service is decent as far as taking orders and knowing what they have. Though I had to argue with several bartenders to get a half pint of a Barleywine. I don't know why that should be an argument?The food is decent. Though I am not really a fan of everything being a \"slider.\" That makes a lot of the menu a la cart. My first visit, I ended up with a steak salad, but there was not much steak to be seen. What was there was tough and chewy.  The salad was a bit slimy as well.  The sliders are nothing bad, they just never seem to live up to what I would expect from the description.Besides a few decent offerings, the tap list is pretty generic. Eight taps that consist of Blue Moon, Fat Tire Guinness, Magic Hat, some BMC, Southern Tier Seasonal, and a managers choice (Arcadia Barleywine when I first visited).  That rotates a bit, so the selection does change.  The bottle list somewhat makes up for the sub par tap list. Mostly the usual suspects like Rogue, Bells, Goose Island, Founders, etc. Overall decent, but not ground breaking (considering the handful of really good beer bars in walking distance).Overall, just an average place to grab a beer and a meal. A slightly above average beer selection, and slightly above average food. There is really nothing that distinguishes this place above the many other restaurant in the area, and there are much better beer bars in the area without a doubt.",

They're the size of donut holes (like those ones you get at dunkin donuts) and you get like 12 of them in an order.  I was full after two....

The salad I got - country fried chicken - was AMAZING. Their honey mustard dressing is light and tangy. I loved the many julienned red onion and cucumber and half cherry tomaotes! By far my favorite part of the meal. Now. The iced tea. Nuh-uh. Is NOT raspberry flavored. Very small cup for the price.I stole my sister's sweet potato fries and eh... Guido's has better. Seven Saint's fries are overly crunchy and weirdly shaped.My friend said the beer selection, though large, didn't have what he really wanted. Also, he said the Seven Saint's salad is a little...offputting. The lime and nut and fruit combo did not a salad make.The actual restaurant was pretty nice. Clean tables. The barstools weren't uncomfortably high. The service was nice, but slow. The server forgot my friend's beer, and was late with the drinks, but was very cheerful and helpful. My sister said the bathrooms were passable.Probably will come back, but will remember to get at least two sliders and a dinner-sized salad.",

There are old pews, vintage chandeliers, and a beautiful wooden piece in the back of the main room all from old Churches, and it was the 7th bar opened by the owner, hence the name Seven Saints. It's all pretty cute and makes a nice place to have an outside dinner. I'd recommend it for sure!",

While it may not be a true 5 star, for CU it deserves it.By the way, why does a city with such a strong mixed population have such a terrible restaurant scene??  Will there ever be any NICE restaurants?",

I wish they had a \"slider flight\" option where you get a deal for 3 sliders or something. The service was prompt and friendly even with our large group. The sliders were.....okay......the bread was kind of mushy and not impressive. The garnishes were more like the quality you'd see at Subway and the beef reminded me of Wendy's or White Castle. Is it the shape, dense texture, or just general tastelessness? I can't quite put my finger on it but it's just not impressive considering its their \"specialty\". The prices are okay but considering that you could probably get better burgers at a fast food restaurant, I feel like they could be cheaper but I guess you're paying for the ambiance and service. Personally, I don't need ambiance, I go out to enjoy unique, high quality food. Ideally, rather than cheaper prices, I think just higher quality food would make more sense. On the plus side, I could see this place being good for picky eaters who are repelled by too many flavors in their food.",

Perhaps the owners need to start dropping back in or have people mystery shop the place.The menu - while not wildly innovative - was well thought out. The appetizers are well done and set up to share, though the fried portabella mushroom strips on the Seven Sinners plate had that 'I've sat in cold storage' flavor to them. That said, the cheese curds and also the beet chips were excellent. I liked the sliders - favoring the blackjack and the buffalo chicken slider. The triple-S plate used to be more of a deal when they would allow you to get two sliders and either a soup or salad. I was sorry to see that go. I've not tried the specials, and each time I've been everyone has done sliders, sandwiches, soup, or salads - so I cant speak to them. The desserts are nothing special, but were decently presented.Out first few trips, the staff was excellent.  We were seated relatively quickly despite being packed. Someone came to take our drink orders in the first few minutes. The waitress was willing to explain things to my party and make substitutions to satisfy vegetarian friends. The beer selection was decent and the mixed drinks were decently strong. While prices were a bit on the steep side, we were fairly happy. On a later trip, the service was slow, the raspberry iced tea was short on the raspberry syrup, and to be frank - I felt rushed out the door once we were done with our entree. That was too bad as the people I was with are the sort prone to ordering dessert and a couple rounds of drinks. If the place was crowded, I could have understood, but it seemed sort of empty.Other reviews have mentioned a chain-like feel. It's true the same group owns a few other local bars - so I'm assuming they use the same architects, designers, and back-office staff. That said, I kind of like the decor and think with a little work on the service Seven Saints could warrant four stars.",

I love the ambiance of the corner bar, dark wood, and dimly lit interior and the extensive offerings of specialty vodkas, gins, and whiskeys.  The cheese curd appetizer was very good but not out of this world.  The beer batter was a little soft and I suspect the cheese had not been frozen prior to deep frying (or not completely), which resulted in most of the cheese over-melting and dripping out of the solidified batter shell.  Still tasty, but missing the mark a little bit.  The sliders were pretty good, but the BBQ had too much botte-tasting sauce on it.  The beef was cooked perfectly though.  Caesar salad was average at best.  On the plus side, they have a nice selection of draft and bottled beer.",

It takes only about 3 to 4 sliders to fill you up, meaning this place has got some bang for its buck. The atmosphere here is great but the place is very noisy on a busy day. It's a place worth giving a shot, and even if you don't find yourself to be a fan at least it wouldn't be an expensive lesson.",

I still go back every year for Christmas to visit family and friends, and when I do, Seven Saints is a must-hit place for food. And I get the same thing every single time.The Triple S Combo Platter. One salmon slider. BLT salad (although I have also tried the Country Fried Chicken Salad... sounds weird but was really tasty). And the tomato basil soup. This is a trifecta of yumminess in my tumminess. There has only been once when the food all tasted kind of off, possibly a bad day. But every year, it always pleases me. And the bill isn't so bad. I don't really drink here, but have had a mojito that was alright, nothing special. I will continue frequenting this establishment for my yearly Christmas visiting. Please stay in business Seven Saints, otherwise I will be forced to make this food on my own and it won't be pretty.",

Exactly, what I was thinking it's not Tuesday Brewsday or their famous Whiskey Wednesday's but a Monday! I had no idea that they have Ribeye dinners on Mondays and 1/2 Price Wine by the bottle. If you are looking for a dinner cure to your manic Monday I would totally suggest Seven Saints! The steak was cooked a perfect medium per my request and was served with broccoli and mashed potatoes. I think the 1/2 off wine bottle speaks for itself. Iggy was my server for the evening and he gave us the best service even though we arrived 30 minutes before the kitchen closed which was 11pm. Thanks Iggy!! Hope you find this review useful!!",

The train got in over an hour late (which seems to be a common occurrence on this route), but I was still a few hours early for the game, so I grabbed some lunch at this place, which is right across the street from the Amtrak station. I was happy to see that it was not jam packed on game day morning. I was by myself so I sat at the bar. I was impressed with the large selection of beers available, both on tap and by the bottle. I'm used to Chicago prices, so being able to get a good draft beer for under 5 bucks was great. They also have Miller High Life on tap for $2 if you're looking to go \"cheap.\"Food wise, I went with a couple turkey sliders, since the menu claims that is what they are \"famous\" for. I also had some of the sweet potato fries. The sliders were just okay, I wasn't blown away by them or anything. Same thing with the fries. The portion was large, but I wasn't crazy about them (I went ahead and doused them in ketchup after I realized they weren't that good). It was a meal that was adequate, and not expensive (each slider was $2.50 and the fries were $1.99 if I am remembering correctly), so I'm not complaining. My total for 2 draft beers, the food, and tip was just over $20.The bartender introduced himself as \"Billy Mays\" and had on an Oxyclean shirt, which was his Halloween costume. He was nice enough and occasionally engaged in small talk, even as the place started to get more crowded. I didn't have any problems with him keeping my water and beer full, and my food was correct, so no issues there.When all is said and done, I can't give this place 5 stars simply because I wasn't blown away by anything. But this is definitely a sold 4 star establishment.",

I particularly recommend the buffalo chicken slider- easily my favorite. Do yourself a favor and ask the waiter/waitress his/her opinion on the amount of food you order- it's very easy to order too much for your party to handle.Beer: Some great seasonal beers on tap for not too much $. You can expect to see draft, seasonal beers for $4, and other beers for cheaper. There are tons of draft and bottled choices. This place has a great bar to sit, watch games, and enjoy an ice cold brew.Service: I was only with one other person so we asked to sit (and eat) at the bar. We had 2,3 staff members (bar tenders) help each other out when it came to waiting on us. They have a team approach- which leads to faster service. The bartenders knew their Illini sports, cared about the downtown Champaign environment by knowing about that weekend's events, and were very down to earth.Overall: I had a fantastic meal, including appetizers, and a beer for $21. A similar place in Chicago would be double that- and the food wouldn't be better either. Downtown Champaign has fantastic bars and eats, and this place is one of them. Seven Saints covers all of the bases- i've eaten here with my family for special occasions, and i've come here in the wee hours of the morning to get my drink on.",

My fiance and I waited at the bar for a drink for about 15 minutes before anyone asked us what we wanted. That may not sound too long, but the place wasn't even busy. And what's funny is the bartender was like purposely ignoring us. There's no way she didn't see us politely flagging her down. She had a soft drink that she was drinking, and she stopped right in front of us, took a nice looooong drink... kind of relaxing, then she looked past us out the window, and proceeded to ignore us a bit longer. And its not like we were just standing there, you can try and flag them down, but they just ignore you like alien possessed humans staring into space or something. The bartender finally asked what we wanted, but by then we were being seated so we said nevermind. Then we proceeded to have terrible service at our table, to the point that it was just kind of amusing. Oh and my cobb salad had these huge mushroom tentacle things that made me gag and we just sorta wiggled them at our friends like \"look at this huge sick thing that's in my salad!\" And the sliders are way over priced. The cheese curds were good, but a little heavy. I say the place has potential because it's a really nice location and the inside has a nice ambiance. There is also an extensive beer list, but none of that really matters if your service is that bad...",

The food: the cheese curds are okay. I'm not sure why everyone thinks they are so incredible? Maybe the massive size? The sliders are pretty good, but I don't think the quality warrants the price. I had the black and blue salad and it was a huge portion for a half size which was awesome! But the taste was not there. It was pretty awful.

                "review": "Well, second chance here. I'll up it one star because they have upped the dress code, which is great! However: this place it a sandwich shop dressed as a dinner place. I truly believe they need to decided which one they are. The menu is confusing and to extensive. They have a lot of options and the combinations are limiting. I got a Black and Blue Salad and my husband tried the bratwurst slider and the fried chicken slider. The fried chicken slider tastes exactly like a McChicken!!! Truly amazing.... Only the real thing is bigger. The bratwurst slider was ok. The meat was good, the bread was soggy and the sauerkraut was lacking in crunch. My salad was ok in flavor. The meat was microwaved and had no crispy ends... Clearly reheated. The mushrooms were soggy and had the same look as large slugs. The soup tasted great!!!! But after asking if it was homemade, our server said it was bagged. We were offered the shrimp tacos, but the shrimp is previously frozen too. I'm still disappointed in Seven Saints. They need to decide what they are. A fancy bar or an American lunch spot, they can't be both. It's not working.  I would love to see the mood lightened and the have a fantastic sandwich shop instead!! Or, simplify the menu, make it classy and keep the dark dinner atmosphere. Sorry I can't do better, but I don't lie in my reviews.",

                "review": "I've been here a few times, and all the earlier ones were pretty good, but this last time was just horrible. I went here on a Saturday with a group of 12. We got there around 8pm. I knew this place was usually busy but when we put our name in, they said it would take 30 minutes. So we figured we would wait since we had not been there in a long time. After an hour of waiting, they were able to seat 6 people. The other 6 had to wait for an adjacent table to open up. It did not open up for another 30 minutes. So I was just really confused on how they would tell us it would take 30 minutes when really it took 1 hour and 30 minutes. The first half of our group had already ordered for us in an attempt to save some time since everyone was starving. After we were seated, it took about 10 minutes for our server to come ask us what we wanted to drink, and then another 10 minutes to actually get our drinks. The food was alright. I usually get different sliders, but decided to try the steak sandwich. It was pretty good, a little messy though since there was a ton of oil that came with it. After we finished, the guy took all of our plates, and then it took 10 minutes for him to ask us if we were ready for the check. then it took him another 10 minutes to get us the check. And then another 10 minutes to charge all the cards. That was one of the worst dining experiences I've had. Over 2 hours of just waiting for things. You would think that with a larger group, he would have paid more attention to us but guess it doesn't work that way.Like I said earlier, I've been here before and they were ok experiences, which accounts for the 2nd star. But we'll see if I ever go back in the near future. Just pissed that we waited so long when the server kept saying it would be 5-10 more minutes every time we asked.",

I've never heard any complaints or noticed any discrimination or racism. People are overwhelmingly happy with their experiences here, as evidenced by how busy it is. Wednesdays do tend to get hectic, so if you are high-maintenance / demanding / have a chip on your shoulder, you may want to pick a different night to go. If you're a normal person like 99% of the other people around, you'll have a good time.With that out of the way, Seven Saints is THE PLACE to drink whiskey, especially on Wednesday, with a 1/2-price special on one of four rotating themes. Every whiskey they have is in one of the themes and will be 1/2-price on its respective day. They have an incredible selection with a whole menu page or two for each theme. The bartenders that work that night are passionate about whiskey and it shows. They know their stuff and can always make a good recommendation based on what you like, tell you why they recommend it for you, tell you what to look for, and answer any questions.",

But this place is a sanctuary for the rest of us who just like to drink whiskey and eat tiny burgers with our friends. I highly suggest the salmon sliders although at $4 a pop they are pretty costly. I pretty much only come on whiskey Wednesdays so I can sample the best that they have. The waiters are always really helpful and will suggest whiskey for you to try even if you're not used to drinking them. Seating can be limited depending on what time you come but if you can grab a table outside during the cooler nights of summer, you'll never find a better place. It is on university so it can be a bit noisy due to traffic.",

In short, we just needed a place to catch up and Seven Saints provided that and more! On a Sunday evening, we were seated outside immediately and our waiter was accommodating and attentive without hovering.  We each ended up going with the slider and salad combo with sweet potato fries on the side.  I chose the salmon slider (complete with cucumber and dill sauce) and the salmon salad (a more Mexican take with a southwest ranch dressing) & I was extremely content with my choices; even having some leftovers for lunch the next day! In my opinion, the portions were definitely very reasonable.  The sliders were about the size of the diameter of a standard water or beer glass or at least that is what our waiter told us! Seven Saints ended up being the perfect spot to catch up with old friends over some delicious food; I'd definitely recommend this joint to anyone with a rumbling tummy in downtown Chambana!",

Yes, there are finer restaurants in CU, yes there are cheaper bars, and yes there are better crowds, however I sure enjoyed the hell out of my last trip. Here's why: they have an excellent liquor selection with a focus on Irish, Scotch, and Bourbon Whiskies. Their food menu has a nice balance of innovation and old standards and was well-executed for everything our group of 6 ordered. Service is quick (turn and burn, baby!) even when they're full. If you are careful, the food and drink is actually quite reasonably priced: soup/sandwich combo, 2x beers, huge club with excellent sweet potato fries all for $30 (whiskey tab was a different story- but worth it). You certainly could spend more on you food here, but if you get the cheap stuff you will still be happy. Also, on Wednesdays, they have HALF price on all their whisky/ey!The bartender also runs classes on the appreciation of this complex but enthralling (some would even say intoxicating) beverage.",

The fact that we have not been back since then probably implies something.We had some pretty darn good onion rings for an appetizer. My wife had a Tomato Pesto Grilled Cheese sandwich that we thought was pretty good, along with a nice Tomato Bisque. I had a trio of Sliders: Asian, Tropical Stack, and Salmon, served with Sweet Potatoe Fries.I grew up in an area that had White Castle restaurants. Now, I never went there unless pressed, but I do know what a slider is.The problem with these was not the taste, which was fine. Nor the size, which was small. The problem is that sliders are moist / greasy. Now, I'm not saying that having a non-greasy slider is a bad thing from a healthful eating perspective. But if you're going to call something a slider, there has to be something non-dry about it. sigh.Service was friendly.I would like to get back there and try some other items, but we always seem to think of someplace else we'd rather eat.",

The crowd was what looked like a mix of graduate students and older couples.Seven Saints is known for their sliders, these mini burgers, kinda like what White Castle serves. The sliders are about $3 to $4 bucks each so it's perfect for ordering a slew of them. I ordered fried cheese curds  for appetizers which were delicious though a little soggy (then again, anything fried pretty much tastes good). There are plenty of vegetarian options. Any slider can be replaced with a boca burger (50 cents extra), but in my opinion a boca burger patty overwhelms any other taste. So what you end up with is pretty same tasting burgers - my boca blackjack cheese slider tasted like my Asian one. The waffle fries were especially good though (better than The Office's ones in Urbana IMO). The beer selection is limited so this place is decent to take group for dinner - there are better bar options for drinks elsewhere. The service was adequate and attentive, but not overly so. What's with the Third Eye Blind love? There were like 3 TEB songs that played that night :S There's also some outdoor seating. I could definitely image coming back here for lunch.I also like the fact that Seven Saints is directly across from the bus/train station (who needs to spend 10 bucks on a cab when there's convenient public transportation nearby? My friends rode their bikes here and took a bus back home (they have racks on the front of the bus to load bikes).All in all, Seven Saints is a decent option for lunch and dinner, but you can find better spirits elsewhere (i.e. Blind Pig, others)",

I'm boring and stick to the bacon ones, but on occasion I branch out; the tropical ones are also really good. What really sets this place apart are the chicken tenders, which are the best I've ever tried. They're reasonably priced and listed on the appetizer menu, but totally worth getting as a main course. The tomato bisque is apparently very good as well (but screw tomatoes, I'm sticking with the food).As good as the food is, the bar is even better. While the drinks are a bit expensive, if you come on Wednesday, various whiskeys are half off. They also have specials on Monday and Tuesday for wine and beer, respectively. I love the bar selection, though. Wednesdays are my favorite day, because I come to Seven Saints and try various whiskeys to sort out my likes and dislikes. If you (or someone you know) is trying to get into whiskey, this is a great place to do it. My personal favorites are the Elmer T. Lee and the various shades of Pappy they have (especially the Old Rip Van Winkle which is fantastic). My only quibble is that the whiskey passports are a bit of a ripoff. It's $5 for the little book, but normally that'd also come with some sort of swag (like a t-shirt or glass) when finished. It'd make a nice little memento for finishing the entire (64 entry) passport. Still, a great place and such a minor nitpick it barely merits mentioning. Seven Saints is fantastic.",

Hey everybody has an off night! My husband and I enjoy not the run of the mill beers and we were surprised to find extensive selection at seven saints. Goose island 312 for me and fat tire for my spouse.We started our dinner off with fried cheese curds. The cheese curds were golden brown and not greasy,they come highly recommended!We each ordered 2 sliders and a side of waffle fries. I had Asian and smoked BBQ slider and Doug ordered BBQ and California turkey slider. All were cooked to perfection and delicious . They have several options when it comes to the menu so I feel there is something for everyone. All in all we had a wonderful dining experience and our waitress( once we got one) was on the ball and friendly. We will be returning and I would recommend Seven Saints to our friends.",

Also, I really love the rib eye steak sandwich, its pricey ($10), but its amazing and it comes with a side (onion rings are killers in here).There is also the possibility of ordering combos with salad, soup, etc... I never had that, but I heard its pretty good.Bottom line: this place is a MUST in Champaign. During weekend it might get crowded and with a waiting line, usually I go by myself, so I never had that problem.",

The money isn't a big deal, but it is annoying to find these little charges on the final bill when we were gonna just tip more anyways.

This would be okay if they hadn't hidden the drafts behind columns such that it's impossible to discover what types of beer they have.The food menu was more promising.  It's split into two parts:  half the items were ripped off from Crane Alley (beet chips with goat cheese, sweet potato fries, cajun crab cake) and the other half are \"sliders\".  Upscale White Castle.Frankly, the food wasn't particularly bad.  My friend enjoyed his salad.  But it wasn't particularly good either:  his slider was only so-so and my sandwich was like a salt lick.  But I probably would have gone back just to break up the monotony of eating downtown if the service hadn't sucked.When our waitress finally got around to us, I ordered a sandwich.  She came back five minutes later to tell me that there had been a \"permanent substitution\" with that item.  By substitution, she meant that it was nothing at all like the description - perhaps it still had the same kind of bread.When I told her I didn't want this new sandwich, she made a big deal out of me being \"too picky,\" and telling me that the kitchen was now going to be mad at her.\"Permanent substitution\"?  Seriously, print new menus and lose the attitude.",

I got a tuna salad sandwich with cheese melted onto one of the pieces of bread. Not much tuna melt action. Eye of the beholder though, I get that.

Fried mushrooms, cheese curds, onion rings--they're all good and don't make you feel gross afterwards like some other places do.The salads are big and hearty. Sliders offer lots of options. And their menu allows you to mix and match things to meet your taste. Personally I like the red pepper gouda soup when they have it and the southwest chipotle chicken salad.

What follows is my progression.My first visit was mostly about the drinks.  I found the beer menu to be decent (which is what I felt like drinking that night).  I know I ordered food and I was not displeased with it.  Overall, my first experience was good and I came back for more.  My next visit included food and drinks.  I went with some sort of mixed drink that tasted fine but was not memorable.  I had the salmon slider to eat.  I did not notice if the menu listed what came with the slider or not, and the waitress did not bother to mention that the slider come with just the sandwich.  When I got my slider I realized that one mini sized salmon sandwich was not going to be enough for dinner.  Sadly, I started eating the slider before I ordered more food.  I can only describe it as a salty salmon puck.  After that, I was no longer hungry, and we went elsewhere.I returned for lunch, and had the BLT salad with the tomato soup.  I recommend both options.  The soup was so good that I came back for lunch again and paired it with the tomato pesto grilled cheese.  This was also wonderful.  In fact it was so good that I found myself craving the soup and grilled cheese one day so I went for lunch.  Now, I am not a fan of swiss cheese which is one of the cheeses in the sandwich.  I requested that the swiss cheese be replaced with provolone instead.  When I got my sandwich there was no swiss cheese, but there was no other cheese on the sandwich.  There should have been American cheese as well.  I guess the server misunderstood my request, and I figured it was an honest mistake so I didn't think it was a big deal.The last straw was yesterday.  I went for lunch again and ordered the tomato pesto grilled cheese with the tomato soup.  Again I requested that the swiss be replaced with provolone.  When I got my sandwich it was more like toast than a grilled cheese.  There was one slice of American cheese and one slice of provolone cheese on each piece of bread, but the cheese was not melty and gooey.  It was toasted and crispy.  Then the pesto was glopped on in one cold dollop.  I found the sandwich to be dry. From now on I will probably only go to this place for the drinks.  Too bad I can find drinks at just about any bar in town.  I feel let down because I really wanted to like this place.  I love the look and feel of the bar, and it has all the potential to be great.  However, if they can't even accomplish a grilled cheese sandwich why would you want to eat their food?",

This Chicago girl says yes, please.  2.  Tasty food.  I had the slider/salad/sweet potato fries combo, and everything was really good.  They're known for their sliders, apparently.3.  Great vibe.  We didn't feel rushed here.  Didn't feel pressured to drink more, and they didn't blink when our party size doubled and we moved to a different table.  Cons:1.  Small-ish portions:  At $10 for the above-mentioned meal, I felt a little.....unsatisfied.  The sliders seem pricey at  $3+ a pop, too.  2.  Service:  A bit slow.  It picked up when we started strictly drinking, but there was nary a condiment to be found during our meal.  All in all, I'd head back.  It's a nice joint in downtown Champaign.",

The steak in it was so chewy.  I took it off the salad but then the salad was still warm.  It had grilled onions and mushrooms on it which I find odd.  I think it's weird to have grilled onions in a salad.  Maybe it's me but it's just not right.The mushroom sandwich was soggy and not very good.  Actually the mushrooms were just fine but putting it together in a sandwich with cheese and red peppers just didn't do it for me.  They do not go together in my opinion. Basically, I found both items odd.The server was great and the food came out fast I will give them credit for that.  I have been here a few times and this is not a place that I would volunteer up if someone was asking for suggestions where to eat.Some people love it and some people don't.",

Other than that, they have a great beer selection, the cheese plate is absolutely delicious (whatever they do to the bread to soften it up is a masterpiece of appetizer prep, plus each type of cheese on the plate is very tasty) and they play some damn good music. On a Saturday night on the outdoor patio I heard them play The Avalanches, Rob Dougan, Gorillaz, Lindsey Stirling and many more amazing artists that just happen to be in my favorite genre. I don't know if it was a streaming service or a custom playlist but they should continue with it. The wait staff are cute, and they do a good job. I really like Seven Saints.",

I was surprised, and actually though our waitress was joking if, when we asked for the check, she asked if we wanted on check or separate checks.  I almost expect to get attitude from a server if a two-top asks for separate checks.  It took her awhile to sort everything out, but hey, she asked for it.

Ordered the Cheese Curds as an appetizer, my gf ordered the Tomato Pesto Grilled Cheese and I had the Ribeye Steak sandwich.  We both had two drinks with our dinner...Cheese curds came before the meal and they turned out to be pretty good.  Nothing to rave about, but average.  At last, our meal was delivered.  The bun for my Ribeye sandwich turned out to be what looked like Texas toast.  As I peeled back the bread to look at my sandwich, I was in for a huge let down!  This was the absolute worst excuse for a ribeye steak sandwich.  My biggest complaint, it was paper thin!  PAPER THIN!!!  Literately speaking, my steak was no thicker than a cardboard coaster.  The price tag on this steak sandwich was $10.  This is my biggest pet peeves when it comes to steak sandwiches...I don't mind paying upwards of $15 for a steak sandwich, but I expect good quality!   This was such a poor excuse for ribeye, I had to eat it with the top piece of toast off, just to taste the meat.  How dare they insult their customers with such a poor excuse for a steak sandwich!  My gf equally hated her grilled cheese for reasons she will explain in her own review.Once the check arrived, ($52) we asked to speak with the manager.  We both expressed our concerns with Andy, the manager.  We felt like after spending $50, we should leave the restaurant full and satisfied.  Instead, we were leaving hungry, miserable, and downright insulted!  Andy rattled off various reason as to why my steak might have been a little on the thin side.  He apologized for the size of the steak, and offered us 2 free drinks to make up for our poor experience.  REALLY???  We spent over $50 and all he was going to do was give us two free drinks?  No thanks!  We refused the free drinks, and made sure he knew he just lost two customers for good.I'm not looking for a handout!  I'm not looking for my money back...but the way he handled our situation was horrible!  If a customer spends $50 in your restaurant and absolutely hated the food, two drinks is not enough to make up for this!  I expected a credit or a gift card to come back and give Seven Saints another chance.  Now, I will never be back!  I can find steak sandwiches comparable to the one I had at Seven Saints at Taffies or Steak n Shake!  Keep your two free drinks!  Just know we will spread the word to anyone who will listen!  I hope you handle future situations better.",

If you don't know what that is, then you have to make sure you check out ALL of the discount alcohol nights at Seven Saints because they are all deals you should take advantage of!The whiskey I got was Snake River Stampede. Mainly because I thought it was funny that it was considered a \"rodeo whiskey\" and also that the description for it said \"this whisky can still kick like a bucking bronco when served neat.\" haha.Another nice thing is that they alcohol menu has two featured House drinks and a description for both. This makes it a bit easier while choosing a drink and you don't have to ask the waitress/waiter about every single drink. Even though my server was nice enough to do it if asked.I got the Triple \"S\" Platter (Slider, 1/2 Salad, and a Side). I got the cheese slider, 1/2 Caesar salad and waffle fries. I liked all the food. Their waffle fries were really good.Up until I tried Seven Saints, I only thought of sliders as the little burgers you get from White Castle, but Seven Saints is now my favorite place to get them. I'll definitely be back soon.",

With plenty of space out and inside, and self-seating, the atmosphere is always semi-casual and always welcoming. After looking at the menu, we expected an average dining experience, based on the fact that the menu accentuates burgers (they call their mini-burgers SLIDERS) and salads...not our usual dining-out fare.However...the wings are the BEST WINGS we have ever had in our lives. They are not your usual buffalo-drowned bits of suspiciously massive chook, these are fine specimens of realistically-sized, expertly-cooked bird, served crispy with your choice of two sauces, (there are lots to choose...from BBQ to Thai Peanut and beyond).In ordering, we found that each ordering the Slider/Salad combo worked really well, although sharing sliders and tasting different flavors also works well. There is an extensive beer/wine selection, including some fashionable Spanish options, however we seriously question a wine list without a single New Zealand option, especially in the Sauvignon Blanc section. Our favorite sliders so far have included the Buffalo Chicken, the BlackJack, the California Turkey and the Salmon, although we highly recommend asking for NO BUTTER on the buns if you are interested in 'eating lightly'. Our two salads (Goat Cheese and Spinach/Fried Chicken Salad) were both surprisingly delicious, after so many below-average iceberg salads in the mid-west.All in all, we think they have found a niche targeting people who appreciate casual dining prepared exceptionally well. This is the PERFECT OPTION for those diners who want a home-town up-scale alternative to Ruby Tuesday, Steak n Shake, Fridays, or perhaps even Guido's at the same price and not at the mall!Expect to spend $30 on food for 2 courses for 2 people.",

I have visited this restaurant twice now, both during the week and on the weekend, and have left feeling very less than satisfied.  The building itself is beautiful, the bar is stunning, the ambiance is lovely, (albeit incredibly loud- so dont go in there expecting to have a conversation with your dinner-mates), but the service is unimpressive.  There are certainly quite a few waiter/waitresses around (enough that i have watched them run into each other) but they never seem to come to my table.  Drinks take too long to be made as well as to reach my table from the bar.  I actually watched my drink sit at the waitress station at the bar with the ice melting in it for a while before it was brought to me.  I had the bavarian pretzels, which were decent by themselves, but the jalepeno sauce served with it was chunky and old, and had thickened to an almost inedible point.   As for the sliders, they were nothing special, and I thought, a bit over-priced for what they were.  I wasnt thrilled about the beef the burgers were made with, and it wasnt seasoned at all.   Absolutely avoid any slider with a Turkey Burger inside, it smelled old and.....stale? rancid? The one shining point of my visits, and the only reason this place gets a second star is because of the cheese curds.  The breading was light and crisp, the cheese had substance, and best of all, they were even delicious re-heated the next day!  The sweet potato chips are also amazing.I want to like this restaurant, but I just cant. This restaurant will never be my suggestion for a C-U dinner option.",

My favorites are the Black Jack slider (pepperjack cheese, grilled onions and ancho aioli topped with fried jalapeos) and the Smokey BBQ slider (cheddar, bbq sauce, fried onion ring).  Good stuff.   The lunch combos are a pretty good deal, which offsets the price issue I mentioned earlier.  I usually get the slider + side + salad combo for lunch (which is about $10), and they have other combinations for that.  I've only had the Caesar salad, and it was fine.  Several of my co-workers have had the salmon slider and said it was good as well.I have tried the crinkle-cut sweet potato fries, which were good but not my personal favorite.  The cheese curds are great (as many others have posted), but you do feel a bit of guilt for eating batter-covered balls of cheese.  It's nearly the epitome of gluttony, and you can feel your arteries harden mid-bite.  We did order the Bavarian Pretzels once also and those were good.Service is usually average, at best, but not worth complaining about much.If it's cold outside, avoid the table near the door!   We went once in February when it was still pretty cold out, and even with a large curtain around the entrance way, we were constantly blasted by cold air when people came in the door.  Even in warm weather it's rather distracting.  We've been seated there twice (maybe it's their only pre-setup table for 8).  I'd recommend asking to sit somewhere away from the door if possible.We'll probably go back.  They have enough variety that it's a nice place to go occasionally.",

It's dark: too dark for any food picture. Feels old/vintage on the inside and has a very cool atmosphere.We started with the Bavarian pretzels and a black & blue salad. The pretzels were really warm and tasty, the salad was also wasn't bad, although kind of skimpy on the ribeye pieces. We each got one of the \"pick X, Y, and Z\" combos. I got an Asian slider with the chicken enchilada soup, and sweet potato fries. It was pretty good, the slider was small, as expected, not quite White Castle size or anything though. I really enjoyed the wasabi flavor of the slaw, but felt it needed more toppings. I did order it with everything on a typical burger (lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle) since the top of the menu said those items were available at your request, but I didn't get any of those items when my food was brought out. I did try my Dad's California turkey slider and thought that was pretty good, too. The soup wasn't bad, although it more resembled a chili in my opinion. Crinkle-cut sweet potato fries were awesome! Seven Saints has an extensive selection of alcohol. I really think they are a bar more so than a restaurant. Lots of exotic, small-batch, local, craft, etc. type liquors, cocktails and beers. I had something called a Dragon's Milk, which was an absolutely delicious stout but pricey at $7.50I forgot our server's name but she did a good job!Overall a little pricey for what it is, but I felt the food was definitely a step up from typical bar/pub food. In my opinion, they should diversify their menu by way of adding some non-sandwich options. I must note that they source most of their meet from Old Time Meat & Deli down the street, which is great, knowing things are a bit more local.I'll be back!",

A fairly interesting building.  Some history there.  But if I wanted history, I'd go downtown Urbana, sit at Blind Pig, or the old newspaper.  Favorites!  Seven Saints, as far as I was always concerned, was god-awful expensive.  And for food you could find pretty much anywhere.  Burgers, fries.  Simple standard sandwiches.  Hit or miss, but I'd say, especially for the money, hit up the diner a few blocks away.  You're going to get a much tastier experience, and service with smile.",

The waitstaff is EXTREMELY knowledgable on different liquors and beer.  They are particularly helpful on whiskey and beer, but more than adequate on just about anything else as well.  The only negative thing I can say is they have changed my thoughts on what to expect out of waitstaff, and I have found many other bars/restaurants lacking.The drink list is huge, and new things are constantly being added.  Its very common for there to be a few \"off the list\" specials, particularly on Wednesday nights.  Wednesdays are a great night to go since 1/4 of the whiskey is half off that night in rotation.  I have tasted a ton of different whiskeys I never would have tried if it wasn't for this night.  The waitstaff is always glad to recommend something new based off your criteria, and I have ended up purchasing several bottles from my home bar after trying them at Seven Saints.The food is good, and always comes out quick.  I am particularly fond of the cheese curds, waffle fries, and sweet potato fries.  Most sandwiches are sliders, so don't expect a large sandwich.  They have a deal where you can split soup, salad, and a slider for a good price, that's normally what I choose.  Their caesar salad is great!",

When we first walked in, I wasn't sure if I was underdressed, was it a dinner only place, the dark lighting, the fancy decorations, I couldn't tell.  But the maitre d' was totally welcoming, and when I asked \"Are you food only or can we get drinks?\" he laughed and said it was no problem, and asked where we wanted to sit. We sat at the bar, and the bartender was very nice and got us our drinks fast.  After we sat down, we realized we should have sat outside because of the beautiful weather, but didn't feel like moving.  I didn't look at the food menu, but a few people I was with ordered food.  Unfortunately, 2 of the 3 orders were wrong.  One friend doesn't red meat, and ordered chicken in her salad, only to bite into a piece of steak.  Another friend said her food was just okay.They had some nice beer choices, and after several years in CA, the prices seemed reasonable.  And actually, I ordered a beer on tap that I didn't end up liking.  The bartender saw that I wasn't drinking it, and asked if I wanted something else.  No problems, no extra charges- it was very considerate.  Granted, I should have asked for a taste before I bought it, but I would have eventually drank it.  It was just an extra bonus that I was able to get something else that I really enjoyed.  Overall, a pleasant experience, and I would recommend it.",

They really know their whiskey so this is a great place to try something new of you have discriminating taste. This is possibly my favorite feature of any bar in the area.They always have a nice selection of beer on tap too (at a nice range of prices) and have recently started \"Brewsdays\" with some nice beer specials.Seven Saints has some quality food too. Sliders, salads, sides, desserts... It's all delicious. Definitely try the sweet potato fries or beet chips. My only complaint about the menu is that, since I tend to order vegetarian, the options can get a little stale (though you can sub in a veggie burger on any of their sliders).My favorite meal? California Turkey Slider (sub a veggie burger, hold the bacon), waffle fries, and the Southwest Chipotle Salad.And last, but not least, the atmosphere: Seven Saints feels classy, but not so classy that you'll feel underdressed if you show up in a t0shirt and jeans. It's a darker feel and the furniture and decorations are detailed and thought-out. Even when it's busy, they bar doesn't get too terribly loud so it's great for a date or a night out with friends if you'd like to be able to have a conversation at the table.",

A bit generic, but comfortable.The bartenders are friendly and on top of things.  A handful of taps, some good micros like Ballast Point and Dogfish Head.  The requisite Macros and a full bar as well.  All things to all people on the booze front.They have a good reuben sandwich, and some specials every once in a while.  The pork tenderloin sandwich was decent, nothing special.  Overall, a nice spot to drink with slightly generic vibe and pub grub.  Not bad as a neighborhood joint, or for a drink after a round of golf.",

The first thing you notice when you step in is the numerous large-screen TVs. There was nothing interesting showing when I came, but I imagine this would be a great place to watch major sports events like NFL games and the NCAA basketball tournament. The restaurant is located within a nice clubhouse, so the place is clean, well-lit, and pretty spacious. In terms of atmosphere and setting, there's nothing to complain about at all.The problems I had were with the food. To start, the water had funny taste to it. Moving on to the nachos, the ratio of ingredients didn't impress me. They overdo the cheese, and skimp on the pico de gallo. The cheese is melted, but the chips are cold. The wings weren't great, being both small and overly fried. But they're just 40 cents each on Sunday so they're still not a bad deal. I wouldn't order these on any other day of the week though. Sandwich wasn't bad, but took a really long time to arrive. We're talking ~45 minutes at 11 AM on a Sunday. For a sandwich and fries.I'll probably go back again to give the place a second chance, but I wouldn't do it without more coupons. My score breakdown looks something like this: 5/5 for the atmosphere, 2/5 for the food, 2/5 for the slow service, 3/5 overall.",

The fries were ho-hum and need to be kicked up a notch somehow.  We will try a different side dish next time around.   The service was outstanding.  Seating was a little too close for my tastes, next time we will request an out of the way table so folks wanting good TV viewing seats aren't crammed in next to us.Cost per person was very reasonable, we WILL be back!",

She had recommendations. We ordered beer and appetizers. Appetizer was the blue cheese chips. Not much flavor. Needed more seasoning. The other was the lime shrimp cocktail. It's warm which is weird. Good flavor though. Menu is burgers, wraps, salads (like ten different kinds), and grill items. Also have a gluten free menu that is a pick a protein and two veggies for 13.99 (steak salmon or chicken). Had the chicken, not a $14 meal but now I don't feel bad about what I ate. Molly had the chicken cease salad wrap. She took half home and claims it was good. Also got fries. She says they had steak seasoning on them. Service was fast and attentive. We were in and out in under an hour. Many tv screens and a few craft beers.",

If you are in the mood for that, you WILL have a good time.  But if you want to sit back and have a few beers and talk, then go to Murphys or Legends.Small dance floor that's crowded when a good hip hop or pop song comes on, but the minute they play country or something slow, it gets empty as can be, til the next good song comes on.  KAMS is always filled with student athletes with the throngs of girls surrounding them.  Drinks are cheap - find a frat guy and he'll buy you drinks all night long in hopes you'll go home with him.

My bells were ringing hard last night when I went to KAMS because those smells filled my nostrils with visions of joy and wonder from my childhood. There is a popular drink served at this pub called the \"Blue Boy.\" It is tasty and good and sweet to the tongue. It dulls all the bad senses and electrifies the good ones. It instills confidence where there was none, and reinvigorates the soul. Now, that being said, utopias such as KAMS can become dystopias if you aren't careful. For one, avoid the basement around the end of October, because it can get pretty scary down there with all the halloween decorations. However when it's not halloween, the basement can be a heaven away from the heaven upstairs.One suggestion is to start serving food. A Blue Boy sandwich, now that is something.*https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brain-babble/201501/smells-ring-bells-how-smell-triggers-memories-and-emotions",

Wow, this bar is more disgusting than ever (I think it gets worse and worse every year - or maybe I get older and older every year and have less tolerance for grossness...)!  When you first step foot into the bar, your feet just stick to the floor.  Do they ever mop???  If your shoes aren't sticking to the floor, they're in an inch of piss/booze/broken glass etc.  I saw a girl laying flat on her back with her hair and skirt in the gross wet mess, and she had lost a shoe.

My feet stuck to the floor throughout the entire bar. The tables probably hadn't been cleaned in years. I think it would have required a power washer and about 2000000 gallons of bleach to clean the place.The bathroom was the most disgusting bathroom I've ever been in other than one in China. That's saying something.The staff at this place was something else. The bar tender was so drunk she asked me to repeat my order of 3 bud lights 4 times in a row. She'd ask, turn around to get them, then turn around and ask what I ordered again...The only plus to this place was for some reason it was loaded with attractive girls (have to imagine it is the cheapest place to drink on campus) and the beer and alcohol was dirt cheap.Seriously, avoid this hole at all costs, or at least bring a clothes pin for your nose.",

My friend Bob and I would go, drink buckets (or jars, whatever) or Miller Lite, and watch \"Married With Children\" on TV.And then I realized that the KAM'S bartenders have decent memories, and so long as you aren't asking them for big fancy drinks with lots of parts, they'll remember you and your face and your drink. If you tip them nicely, they'll have your drink waiting for you when you return to the bar. Or maybe that was just me, I can never be sure. Hell, maybe I stole someone else's beer.Regardless - it's a dirty, dumpy little dive full of underdressed, underaged children with popped collars and excessive skin-baring.

I wanted to try them all!Sweet Moses! The only way they would sell me a sausage is if I paid 8 dollars for a \"meal\" and then they would \"add on\" a sausage for another 3 dollars! I saw massive piles of sausage sitting right behind the woman I was trying to order from. I just wanted a sausage or two and was willing to pay a premium for their sausages. But 8  dollars for one sausage?! Come on. This is a classic rip-off! Taking advantage of a community event to make a few extra bucks? Shame. Even the taste of champaign wasn't this blatant. I hope the organizers of Oktoberfest next year  are more judicious in their choice of vendors.",

You find 15 varieties to choose from sourced from a place in California that's the real deal (continental sausage Glendale CA) and the house made sauerkraut has a sharp vinegar bite, which balanced with the fizzy taste of fermented cabbage and is an awesome complement to the tubes of meat. Served with a German style mustard and German potato salad you have yourself an authentic experience.   At a very reasonable price you can have yourself a great German meal compared with the schlep to Gibson city for the bier stube, which is also amazing but pricey.  Go support these guys who are doing something cool and local!!",

But sitting outside was perfectly fine with me. Lots of space outside the restaurant letting many customers to enjoy the weather. They have daily deals on drinks and food, changing every day which is really cool and I would go back for the deals. We went on a Saturday which is when brunch is offered til 3pm. I ordered a Cajun omelet. It had this Mexican appeal to it because I got salsa & sour cream with it. And it had a kick. The omelet was large but thin. Not much to it although it was nice and cheesy and that's always important in omelets for me! The prices are cheap too so it works out.",

Whoa!  Great deal and the food wasn't half bad. So why two stars?  They were understaffed that day. That is something that I understand and can roll with. Not a problem.  It took 10-15 minutes before the server noticed my gesturing. Eventually I placed a dinner order.  I had ordered a beer and 15 minutes later I made mention of it to the server. I just thought she forgot. Her response was completely uncalled for. Harsh tone, reactionary word choice, scowl...  I asked the table if I came off rude or something. No, I was apparently quite nice. Not only did I feel like walking out, everyone at the table was looking around wondering what the heck just happened. Someone a few people down said \"oh, yeah. That's why we never come here.\"  We were a polite, hungry, and thirsty group with ages ranging between 20-60.  The staff made us feel like an intrusion as my simple question wasn't the only time we were snapped at and dumbfounded by our treatment. The tip was added into the bill. I still gave her a dollar on top of the included gratuity.  She ended up with a 30% tip from me. That is likely the only time I step foot in that place. I was treated like an inconvenience. Trash.  I would have ordered a few more beers. I stopped at one because of the ridiculousness. Food, drink, and price was great. The staff is the worst. The.  Worst.",

I used to have the thought of open a bar like this. Since there aren't any premium or high-class club here at CU. Shame it's still a thought to me but someone else make it real. This is my first comment, usually I'm too lazy to leave any but not this one! I'm telling u I'll seek for job there, maybe u will see me working there next time you go to A plus! At least I could be part of this club? l don't know lol",

We avoided this place for a long time because the only genuine reviews here were so negative and we didn't want to accidentally walk into an upscale version of Hooters. We ultimately decided to try it on an impulse while walking by to buy tickets for an upcoming event. Our experience was surprisingly average! Despite the odd claims that the waitresses  are \"super hot\" I was happy to find them to be very average and down to earth. Most importantly, I was happy to see that there were no stripper poles, blacked out windows,  or scantily clad bartenders. We decided that this place would be great to rent or reserve for a celebration or to come for karaoke. Let's be honest, it's Urbana. This place is never going to be a hopping dance club but I could see this place being a super fun karaoke place. They've got a big stage that's just perfect for it.There are definitely a few things to be desired. They're trying really hard to appear high end but the menu consists of low end bar food. The music doesn't fit the ambiance at all. They were playing a mix of classic rock and top 40 when the vibe is more suitable for r&b or jazz. There was also a lingering odor of deep fryer.In the end, we were happy this place wasn't as trashy as it sounded and will probably be back to check on updates and look into reservations for an upcoming special occasion.1/30/15 UPDATE I came here for the magic show and I was chewed out by the owner and security for 'blocking the view' of a man. I guess it was more important that the lazy guy behind me have a completely unincumbered view in his comfortable seat than it was for me, a petite girl and devoted yelper to enjoy the show. After the show was over, I guess the owner didn't want all the pesky customers to hang around and enjoy another drink while they talk about the magic show. It was probably a better idea to go back to blasting techno at full volume and to initiate a fully overstimulating light show for an empty room. I am being generous by maintaining 2 stars instead of dropping them down to one. They are so lucky this magic show was in their establishment. It was so entertaining, its the only reason I'd be caught dead at A Plus VIP Lounge.",

The issue with this place is that it's clearly owned by people who have not spent much time in a nightclub.  First, if you're going to buy bottles, there should be no cover charge.  Second, if you're asking about bottles at the door, there should be at least 2 hosts (and the owner if it's as slow as it was that night) greeting you and asking how they can help.  The drinks are under poured, the cups and under sized and I was less than impressed with the clientele.  If you want people to spend lots of money in your club, then you need to dress the part.  Sadly, this place isn't going to survive . . .",

I definitely need to go check the wine list myself! Maybe you should, too. One more thing to say, I have read other comments below and here's my thoughts: Walking into VIP zone or fled with unpayed bill, that's not the club's fault I guess? Let you stay the VIP zone is just been nice and charge before serve is just being cautious as far as I can tell. Anyway, check it out urself and prove whether I'm right or wrong!",

We decided to come at around midnight on a Saturday to give it a shot.We were pleasantly surprised to find there was no cover charge, but quickly found out perhaps why that was.... there was hardly anyone in the place, practically empty!We scoped the place out before ordering and I was actually impressed with the ambiance and dcor, it really has the look and feel of a city nightclub or lounge. It was extremely clean and well-kept which is a nice change of pace from the notoriously scummy campus bars. I asked for a menu to look at the cocktail list, I ordered a \"Taurus\" and my roommate got an \"Innocent Eyes\". I very much enjoyed mine, I thought it was a really tasty cocktail. He thought his may have been a little on the weak side. These were $8 each, a little expensive, but in all fairness it was a great cocktail I would order over and over. My only reservation about the price was because I could have sworn I seen the bartender(s) use the well liquor in my drink, and I would at least expect something a little better than wells for an $8 drink.  A cranberry vodka I had later was ~$5. Other friend was a little disappointed they didn't know how to make a \"Singapore Sling\", which perhaps might have been more likely at a nicer place like this, oh well, not a big deal. He did like the Mai Tai they mixed up though. The place uses the goofy iPad/tablet for when you close a tab or buy a drink with a card, which is a pet peeve of mine, especially when our intoxicated group can't figure out how to work the damn thing.They had a DJ that night and the music was typical mixed top 40 stuff, not necessarily my style, but I have heard worse and the volume was not entirely unbearable. The ~10 other people in there had taken spots up from closer to the DJ while our crew hung out towards the back and more or less watched. This girl, bless her heart, approached us and asked what it would take to get us up front dancing in terms of a song. Drunken me blurts out \"Stayin' Alive\" by the Bee Gees since the group kind of hesitated. It was the first thing that came to mind and it's a dancing classic for anyone who appreciates music of that style and vintage. She looked a little confused and didn't seem to know the song, but alas went up and requested the DJ play it, which after a quick dirty look he reluctantly did. We had our couple minutes of fame, embarrassed ourselves, and returned to our table and resumed observing everyone else.I really think this place has some potential to be awesome. Unfortunately, the location isn't on campus and I'd expect most students don't necessarily know about A Plus VIP Lounge. I would definitely say there is a customer base for this type of establishment at UIUC, students just don't seem to be aware of it and consequently draws more local people. They should do some campus advertising, maybe even have a one time (or more often) discounted Friday or Saturday drink special to get the ball rolling.Maybe we came on a bad night, it was a little rainy/drizzly so that could be a factor.I will definitely come back.",

The interior is pretty chic, the drinks are good (love their house strawberry infused vodka!), it's off campus (aka fewer undergrads, no offense), servers actually walk around with some semblance of regularity, and there's a bit more seating here than at other places.  It can get very crowded and loud especially on the weekends, but if you can manage to grab a booth/table it's a pretty fun place to be.",

There was nothing wrong with the dishes per se, but there was definitely not anything remarkable. For the portions they were definitely not worth the price. The flavors tended to be fairly bland, and I was really not impressed. The presentation was well done, however. On another note, the martinis were great, and reasonably priced. I got a dirty martini, and substituted Stolichnaya for the Svedka, and it turned out really well. The waiter forgot to specify the vodka change on the second round, and while service was slow, the food came fast once the order was in. The experience was not unpleasant, but I doubt I'll be back. There are better places elsewhere in downtown Champaign.",

Met up a couple of friends here for a drink and ehh it was alright. My mojito was too sour and the leaves are grinded up pretty good so you can sip up a herb and not even know it. I sipped an herb and chewed on it by accident and YACKCKK!! My friend's martini was too strong for her so she asked to have it re-mixed, the waiter said he was too busy but questioned her for 3 minutes about her drink saying he couldn't do it, and wadda-ya-know, he did it! He was friendly overall, however, but saying one thing and then the truth comes out is a slight pet-peeve for me.Environment was nice; music really cranked up at 10 on the dot. Good place to chill and have a few drinks, what i really liked were the prices. They were very moderate and not overpriced. I would come back again but next time i'll pre-drink so I can babysit another mojito that i don't enjoy. :).P.S. I received a follow up message; this goes to show that this restaurant really shows effort to tend to the comforts of the customers. Great service!",

                "review": "My idyllic memories of Boltini are almost assuredly the product of imperfect memory and undiscerning taste, reader beware.  But even the particulars I can recall still sound objectively wonderful.  Metal baby feet for door handles, internally-lit glass panes that trap splays of branches and project Tim Burtonesque shadows on the walls above the intimate circular booths and swank cushions in the recessed lounge, Bells on tap, a full array of top shelf liquors (not normally a special attraction, but it's in Central Illinois after all), and a martini list I used to adore.  This is really where the lovely memory gets shaky:  I was horribly fond of the \"Hollywood\": Absolute Mandarin, Chambord, and orange juice, which now just sounds heinously sweet and I seem to remember them costing far more than I ever wanted to pay for a drink in Champaign.  It makes me wonder if perhaps I would be disappointed were I to return, but I suspect that Boltini is still the only bar in Champaign that manages to be sort of hip, almost pulls off posh, even seems legitimately urbane.  And once in a while, in a college town, that's absolutely worth the slightly higher prices.   Light appetizers are available until 10pm, and the menu aspires to a cheese-plate and pesto bruschetta sort of class, but I never got there early enough to judge the execution.  Oh, and don't miss the doll's head in the banister....and it suddenly occurs to me that maybe I'm just squicky about the dismembered infant parts.  Regardless, four stars.",

Started by sharing a huge bowl of Roasted Red Pepper & Smoked Gouda soup. Towards the bottom of the bowl, it started to get spicy. The spice was nicely counterbalanced by bits of bacon.Next, we shared a generous cheese plate with baguettes and fresh fruits. We chose three cheeses that would not be incorporated into other portions of our meal. Porter Cheese, Goat Cheese, and Bacon-Encrusted Brie. The Brie was excellent. It might be related to my obsession with bacon. I will tell you that somehow I passed on ordering their 12 perfectly cooked pieces of bacon appetizer.Finally, we ordered three small plates. Mushroom crostinis, crab cakes and bacon-wrapped blue affine stuffed dates. Crab cakes had a tropical feel because of a light slaw with fruit incorporated. The dates were delicious but heavy and rich. The portion included six dates. That would be great for six people as one was enough.Great night with great service. However, we got the feeling that we needed to initially command the attention of a server. The restaurant's tables are first come first serve and that chaotic feeling carried over into getting a server's attention that we were at the restaurant to eat and not just drink. If you aren't assertive, you may find it hard to get a table and to get service.",

My two favorites were the artichoke dip and the ahi tuna wonton (but again, I like everything with ahi tuna). The sandwiches were also really good too. We also got all their desserts (they had like 3 to choose from), and I loved the creme brulees. Best of all, the price was surprisingly cheap!The drinks were mostly good. Their beer of the month was good and cheap at $3. Other than that, their drinks fall in the $6-9 range which is a little steep for a town like Champaign. However, they make their drinks really strong, so you kinda have to pace yourself through the drinks.Overall, I like this place a lot. Great ambient, great food, great drinks, reasonable price. It's quite a rarity in Champaign.4 stars if you want to go there for drinks5 stars if you want to go there for dinner (because it's a bargain for the quality of food you get, especially when you have a gift certificate from restaurant.com).",

So yes, Boltini is known for their martinis, but they have quite an awesome (and oft overlooked) beer list.  I got a Shipyard Pumpkin Ale - that stuff's hard to find in Chicago, so points to the C-U mini-metropolis on that one!For dinner, we went with the crab cake appetizer (as a Child of the Chesapeake, I am honor-bound to try any crab dish heralded as \"best in town\").  I must say, this appetizer held its own.  While these were not traditional Chesapeake cakes, they took on a sort of Asian flair with the sauce and the vegetable pairings (I had no idea what to expect when I read that this came with \"Asian Slaw\".  What is that?  Eh, I'm still not sure, but it was delicious).  We definitely cleaned the plate.For my entree, I ordered the Blue Crab salad.  It was basically the appetizer salad-ified.  Without my asking, the dressing was on the side (gold star!).Overall, everything was fresh, tasty, and a touch unexpected (you never know when it comes to \"bar food\").  While their drink menu far surpasses their dinner menu, Boltini is still a decent spot to grab a bite downtown.",

I didn't even know this place had a dinner menu since all their drinks have the spotlight, but it's not too bad, depending on what you get.  For a cold night like this, a selection from their 'hot drinks' looks perfect to warm you up, and someone ordered a 'Peppermint Patty.'  A bunch of others got their $4 specials of Razzmo's and Clementine Cosmo's.  I just stuck with water.But back the the food.  It is cheaper than most of their drinks!  Pastas started at $6.50 and sandwiches were up to $10.  The Liar's Club Sandwich caught my eye because of the raw ahi tuna, avacado, and sriracha aioli sauce.  Everything was tucked inside of a soft sun-dried tomato bun cushioned with a bed of sprouts.  They could have spiced the tuna a bit more, and added some more sriracha.  I was searching for more flavor with each bite and before I knew it the sandwich was gone.It was easy to eat because the softness of the sandwich, but needed a stronger punch ... and maybe some crunch.  My friend had to add hot pepper flakes to everything.  I'd say get the pizza or pesto pasta if you want something that is guaranteed to be good.  Their ahi tuna tacos and \"grown up grilled cheese\" looked interesting.  They have something called the 'Brownie Tower' which is self-explained heaven and served with a shot of chocolate milk.The ambiance is alright, they have cool names for everything and an endless list of classy drinks.  However it's funny I felt like the menu was trying to assure me that eating here made me \"grown up.\" Hence the \"grown up\" grilled cheese or a \"grown up\" shot of chocolate milk.  It's a creative twist to kiddish foods but thanks for the reminder.  A word of advice, order the things that are listed the most on the menu.  The 10 pages of drinks and 5 pages of cheese were no accident.",

It was mentioned to us by the beautiful bride to be to try this place. Wonderful high ceilings, comfy curled couches, interesting bar seats, cute bar staff, (well... okay the girls behind the bar), and a very mixed crowd. But what were we here for? Well, myself and the rest of the crowd wanted a beer, my friend wanted some girls he could hit on. I won. Were there girls he could hit on here? Yes, so don't get me wrong on that account, but not the skanky girls he was interested in. We sat at the bar, I poured over their menu, rather impressive. About 8 to 10 different dirty martinis as well as a multitude of drinks and wines. Plenty of imported and micro brews abound,  Food looked pretty good as well, but my stomach was full from munching earlier, but on the other hand if it wasn't, I would have chowed down. I do have to say the staff behind the bar was hustling their butts off, so I allow the waiting a bit to get some attention to slide. Yet, I didn't understand why the bartenders were also serving tables as well, perhaps some one called in sick. Yet, they were still friendly and even made sure my friend's martini was just right when he said it was too dirty for him.  Even a DJ was spinning some tracks. I do have a weird feeling that this place is trying to do too much, perhaps with the competition of bars in the area they are trying to serve an everything under the sun atmosphere in a more upscale college town. I really liked it and if I ever find myself in town again, I want to stop by here. However I need to find a driver for this town to whisk me away back to my hotel. Finding a cab is harder than finding a Michigan Wolverine fan here.",

We all, especially me, really liked the place itself; a loungey, chill vibe. I'm not a beer guy so I was very pleased with their great drink selections AND all 1/2 price! I thought this was a sure winner. It was kinda slow, and the main reason we left that time after only one drink was that the demographics threw us off. After some shifting during the 20mins. or so, there ended up being 5 couples there: all same-sex, 4 of the 5 were guys. Being new to the area, we didn't know if we found ourselves in a gay bar. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that, but it's just not conducive to keeping single straight guys around.This past week we came back because I was assured that it was a place open to all, so I talked the others into trying it again. On this, our second attempt (and third; we ended up coming back later), we got there around 10pm. It was later than the last time so I expected a bit more of a crowd. I guess that's my only complaint about this place. We gave it more of a chance, sticking around for just under an hour. It was worthwhile, but just not getting as active as we hoped. It did seem to start to shift as we were heading out, but he others had decided to move on.We ended up back there an hour later. The scene was about the same as when we were leaving; still just on the brink of happenin'. We stayed for about 45min, and I easily could have spent the rest of the night there but the others wanted to go back to the clubby place we closed at on our previous night.When we go back next week I think I WILL be sticking around if the vibe is right letting the others move on. I really want to love this place cuz it has all the right attributes for me (almost). Here's to hoping my next review will be 5 stars!",

I went out with the ladies, and was a few drinks in by the time we got to boltini. I had the strawberry gimlet, which was a homemade mixture of strawberry puree and vodka, topped off with a healthy pour of chambord ($7.25). I don't usually like paying this much for a cocktail but you really do get what you pay for! The drink did not taste of sugar or artificial strawberries... it tasted fresh and was absolutely fantastic! Also, the drinks are strong. They really aren't messing around. All of the employees were nice and accommodating too! I might not bring the boy for a quiet night out, but for me and my girls, boltini is a nice treat :)",

The one on their website doesn't even scratch the surface.I had something called a lime ku-ade and it was solid, if unremarkable.  I hit a home run with my second drink, a lemonade concoction that was equal parts boozy and smooth.  I expected to find it on their website, but it's not there.Our server was nice and prompt and had several recommendations for our group.Wasn't a fan of the layout.  It's just a long bar with a few booths.  Our booth faced the door to the kitchen, so the dark atmosphere was frequently punctured by the bright light of the kitchen.  That's a small drawback.If you're in this part of town, it's worth dropping in for a killer cocktail.",

We came with a huge group for a friend's birthday and even though all the round tables were taken, the manager sat us at a bar height table and provided us all with barstools to wait for an open table. The manager was AMAZING - so friendly. Even though the bar was completely packed, he still came to check on us throughout the night even after he found us a round table. My wine was delicious and well-priced and after trying a few of my friends specialty cocktails, I will definitely try a martini next time. Also, the decor and atmosphere is extremely stylish and chic. It's a nice little escape from the sometimes ho-hum Champaign-Urbana atmosphere. It would be amazing for a girls night out.",

My favorite is the \"adult\" grilled cheeses because the cheese they use is amazing. Smoked gouda and bacon alongside shots of vodka tomato soup? Heaven. However, the cheese plates themselves are less satisfying. I wish they had more cheese and fewer garnishes.",

Inside is dimly lit with strategically placed candles and intriguing local artwork hung throughout. Intimate booths up front for a date night and plush couches in the back for larger groups - I'm a fan of both. Drinks are priced relatively high for Champaign-Urbana standards at around $7-10 a cocktail, but they are made strong and well so it's worth it in my opinion. Food there is alright - I'm trying hard to remember it but failing ... which means it must not have been that spectacular.Summary: Go to Boltini if you want to get away and relax in an intimate setting. Not if you wanna get wasted and start dancing on the tables. Go to Joe's or Murphy's for that.",

Why a place that is usually as top-notch as Boltini would just dump a sauce into a cardboard container, I don't know.",

My brother is newly 21, so why not go somewhere with an amazing looking drink menu as well as an amazing looking menu?We got there relatively early on a Saturday, roughly 645pm. There were only a few individuals when we got there. We started the night with drinks, continued the night with drinks, and ended the night with drinks. Oh, and maybe some food. We each had martinis to start and were fairly pleased. Then I stumbled upon this gem of a mojito - strawberry basil. There were no mint mojitos due to the seasonality of mint - I love when restaurants acknowledge this fact. However, strawberries are in season, and made the most delicious drink. Maybe this is why I had 3.Oh, yeah, there's food. Do yourself a favor and order a cheese plate. A lot of the cheeses are from local farms and DELICIOUS. I continued the cheese parade with the Mac and Cheese. Cheddar and strong blue cheese? YUM. By the time we left (about 9:45pm - we take our time!) this place was PACKED, and much louder.Maybe since I'm used to paying Chicago prices for drinks, I found this place to be very reasonable. My mojitos were $8. We spent $95 on drinks, $50 on food, and were stuffed and well \"hydrated\" and very pleased.  Very pleasant service, although as Boltini got busier, we saw our waitress less (she was also doubling as a bartender). I will be back, Boltini.",

Boltini is pretty much the bar you go to when you \"graduate\" from C Street so I'm always bound to run into someone I know.  Sitting outside isn't as amusing as it used to be when \"Three Dollar Margaret\" used to roam Neil Street hitting people up for money, but it's still fun to watch everyone thinking Downtown Champaign is Chicago....it's not.  If you're in Champaign and want to avoid Highdive (do so at ALL costs) and don't want to deal with the high school reunion at Guido's go to Boltini.  You'll leave broke but you'll have a great time!",

Do not come here if you are looking to be ignored and having to hunt down staff/bartenders.I understand that Champaign is a small town with literally nothing to do but come on now! My boyfriend and I drove down to visit his son that attends UIUC. After having a horrible dinner we decided to stop at this place. The only reason we stopped here was because it looked cozy from the outside and it was right next to our hotel. Now I liked the decor and the people that were in there were just \"ok\". This is were this place screwed up and pissed me off !!!!!!!!1. We sat at the bar and it was a pretty slow night. WE WERE IGNORED BY THE RUDE A$$ BARTENDER!2. I had to catch an attitude to get his attention and after that he was still a d&#%!3. He SNATCHED my credit card out of my hand to open a tab - NO! DONT EVER SNATCH ANYTHING THATS MINE OUT OF MY HAND4. He was pissed because I requested Titos vodka in my Cosmopolitan - how do I know? He looked at me, rolled his eyes, threw cup the old vodka was in, looked at me again, said something bitchy under his breath, aggressively grabbed the Titos bottle and then charged me for drinking a Cosmopolitan that tasted like baby juice. 5.  HIS NAME IS VERY INSIGNIFICANT AND IRRELEVANT BUT HE WAS WORKING (Saturday, March 8th at 9:30 pm)I can't believe the nasty attitudes and horrible customer service I have received in this place. I wasn't asking to have my ass kissed; all I wanted was a drink and enjoy my time. What really surprised me was that another PAYING client wanted to order a drink and he had to literally get nasty with the staff and bartenders to get anyone's attention. I thought I was nasty and bitchy but clearly this is what they do at this bar. Every single person that was behind this bar on March 8th, needs to be severely disciplined. You work in the service industry and should never act towards your clients the way they've acted this night. I will never ever come back to this place and I will tell everyone!",

The servers are as good or better than any other bar in CU that comes to mind (and, for better or worse, I drink nearly everywhere).The place where Boltini really stands apart (for me) are their martinis and mixed drinks. If you order a dirty martini, for example, but specify that you want it only a little dirty they'll get it just right. Their Old Fashioned is quite a production. I forget what all Robb (mgr) put in it, but it was delightful. My absolute favorite mixed drink at Boltini is their Sugar Plum. It sounds pretty froofy, and it is indeed delightfully delish, but this straight arrow stands behind this very strong and very purple (tasting) beverage. I am not sure if the fact that I order mine without sugar on the rim of the glass makes my Sugar Plum swilling any less emasculating, but I do want that fact noted for the record.Lastly, Boltini's hosts 'Tuesday Night Trivia', starting every Tuesday night at 7pm. It is a lot of fun and all you have to do is come with a friend or two or 4 (I think 5 is the max, but it may be 6) and let them know your team name. At this trivia night, as opposed to Canopy Club's, which takes place at the exact same time, team names are punny, but not perverse. The host(s) pass out answer sheets for you to fill in and ask several rounds of questions over the PA. Dont be afraid to ask questions if you are curious. Competition is fun, and the whole thing lasts about 2-2.5 hours. Winners get prizes, including free drinks, appetizers, and even massages. The crowd is good: think professionals, teachers, librarians, grad students and profs. I don't go regularly anymore because it is just a 'lil too dear and also a 'lil to slow. Canopy Club's questions come faster. NTN trivia at BW3's is faster still.Park behind Boltini's in the lot.",

We sat down at one of the small tables and it was much smaller than we thought so I asked her if she had a bigger table...she pointed to her left and looked that way pretty much saying \"that way\"...okay fine...our entire service she seemed really standoffish and not willing to get into the service. We asked her questions about a certain dish, she just stared at us as though we should know what it was and said \"its just 6 pieces on there\"....Then everything came out nice that we ordered, except my friends tapas dish. It wasnt even hot at all. So he told the waitress that he no longer wanted it and if he could order something else (this is when the attitude sparked ALL the way up). She began to question him as to why he didnt like it, and what he didnt like about it and this and that. After he stated that it was cold (for the 10th time) she said we can reheat it in the oven but he cannot have anything else. I got the manager. (Come on now, Ive been to OLIVE GARDEN, and had better service...they are always willing to switch something out if its cold or you do not like it, even though the reason he didnt want it was because it came out cold and unappetizing)When I got the manager she was really nice to me at the bar, but before she could get back to our table, our waitress talked to her. Which resulted in the manager now having an attitude with us. Mind you, it was 5 of us so they can all attest to this and will NOT be returning either, and we have told all of our friends as well. Why the manager was arguing with us, I WILL NEVER KNOW. very long story short, good drinks, terrible service, and even worse management. Honestly, servers can act that way, hey you never know who is having a bad night,  but management SHOULD NEVER EVER act that way.",

The food's only okay (I liked the chicken quesadila but not a lot), but it's pretty cheap and, honestly, you don't come to Boltini for the food. You come for the cocktails. The martinis are great, and if you don't like vodka martinis, there are plenty of great drinks on the menu (personally, I get dirty martinis and Old Fashioned when I don't want to drink sugary stuff). The bar is gorgeous, and they almost always have some sort of music, whether it's a live DJ or a guy and a keyboard (okay, that's not always the best sort of thing). The specials are also fantastic; Wednesdays feature half-price cocktails, and Thursdays feature half price martinis. While I wish they'd tell me what qualifies as a \"martini,\" I'm not going to complain. $15 can get you three really good drinks and a very strong buzz.",

I have never been as insulted by a waiter in my life as I was last night, when our waiter threw our checks at us and then went to the trouble of getting cash out of the register to RETURN OUR TIP, also throwing it at us, even though we paid with credit card.  Not only was this guy completely out of line, when I began reciting this story to friends later in the night \"We almost got in a fight with our waiter...\" everyone I told it to knew which waiter I was talking about from previous experience.  I won't be going back to Boltini for a while, and it gets demoted to 2 stars.  That kind of treatment is unacceptable.I think Boltini is my favorite bar in CU since it is essentially the only one that does not pander to Illini sports and skeezy undergrad men trying to get 18 year old sorority girls drunk, but it's hard to get my friends to go there because they think this makes it \"pretentious\" and \"snobby,\" preferring to get barfed upon at Mike and Molly's or wherever.  Personally I do not think it is pretentious, and I tend to think that the staff are only snobby when the patrons are acting like they are at a kegger and not like normal human beings trying to enjoy a non-Keystone Beverage.  Notably, when I first visited Boltini on a grad school visit whileI was living in Boston, I was SHOCKED at how cheap the drinks were.  I did not expect such low prices from such a well-appointed bar.I would EXPECT Boltini to have the best cocktails of any place downtown but I think that award , bizzarely, goes instead to Guido's.  The other factor contributing to the four star rating is the terrible, omnipresent, cigar-doused in ammonia smell that is even detectable out on the patio.  Perhaps this will improve when Champaign becomes smoke-free.",

We noticed there were reserved signs on all the tables that had daylight on them so we were directed to the back where they have creepy crescent shaped booths.They have daily specials and the special was $5 cosmos so we all ordered one.  It was really good and really strong!  One is all you need.  We also ordered the margherita pizza, artichoke dip & the fancy mac & cheese.  The pizza was good, the dip was fabulous and the mac & cheese was gross. I do not know why they called it fancy mac & cheese.  The noodles were too big and chewy and the cheese did not have any flavor.  It was bland and boring and sticky.  Nothing fancy about it all so that was misleading.The dip had some hotness to it and had good flavor and consistency.  None of the food came out hot.  The pizza cheese was luke warm at best so I think it was sitting in the kitchen waiting to be brought out for a while.Our waitress was really nice and very helpful with helping us select menu items.Would I go back?  Yes, I would go back and try something different and hopefully we could sit somewhere towards the front and the light of day.  This place is really dark.",

Think black leather semi-circle booths with high backs in the middle of the room. Towards the back of the room are black leather rectangular IKEA couches with glass tables and candlelight everywhere.The drinks are large, mixed well, strong, and tasty. Personally, I prefer a perfect (half dry, half sweet vermouth) gin martini, shaken.You CANNOT go wrong with the cheese plates here. Make sure to come at least in a group of four so you can order the 3 cheese plate. You choose from a cheese list and it is brought out with sliced baguettes (toasted and non-toasted), fruit (green apple slices, grapes), and olives. I would highly recommend the gueyere, euro cream, and the cheese infused with port wine. But seriously, pick and choose to your hearts content because the pairing of great cheese with great drinks will make you feel reallll sexy.I exposed my friends for the first time to Boltinis last weekend and they were highly impressed with the classy setting, quick servers, and amazing cheese and drinks. Even on a hectic Saturday night, we found a nice seating area in the back of the pit for all 8 of us.Boltini Lounge is a place that should stay hidden (thank God it's in dtown Champaign and not on campus) for its adventurous, sick-of-underage-teenybopper-gangsta-wannabes, discriminating clientele. I tell my friends that Boltini Lounge is where the people sick of the same scene at Joe's, Fubar, or even SoMa turn to.We will be there again tomorrow night for a birthday :)EDIT:Only downside is that they don't serve wine... So unfortunately you can't bring your own bottle of nice wine to enjoy here. But I guess you're supposed to be here for the martinis right?",

We shared a mushroom/goat cheese crostini appetizer. The mushrooms and cheese were sort of creamed together, which I wasn't happy with at first, but liked it once I tasted it. I had the lobster bisque, which was a special, and it was a nice price (I think $5 for a nicely sized bowl). The drinks will kick your ass... in a good way. Our waiter was SO FUN. Only downside is that we were checked on a little too often, and weren't really given enough privacy to chow down.",

If you like laid back beer-bars like Esquire or Mike and Molly's, you'll be confronted with something entirely different at Boltini. If you're interested in paying a bit more for girly, froo-froo cocktails, food that looks like food only smaller, or an entirely different experience this is the place for you. My most memorable moment at Boltini: asking for a Blue Moon and being handed a bottle (it's on draft everywhere else), and nearly spitting it out when I was told it would cost $4.75! (UPDATE: Blue Moon's are $4.25, not $4.75). They also assigned a single waitress to a group of over 20. When the clearly over-worked waitress couldn't keep up with the groups demands for drinks, I went to bar, and was rudely told by the snobby bartender woman that she couldn't add my beer to my tab because I had started the tab with the waitress. Again, I feel this would be an easy request for any other downtown pub to fill; but Boltini staff are too good to add one number to another number. That being said, if you're interested in fancy cocktails and fancy food--and are willing to pay extra for it--you'll probably like this place. If you're not a cocktail drinker, then skip this place.UPDATE: Thanks to Robb for responding to my concerns. Like I said, it's not my taste, but many people seem to like it. I'd rather have a diverse downtown than have everything the same.",

I've been here a couple times and I will say that going in warmer weather is so much better because of their nice patio.  The inside is nice, too, but can get incredibly loud after 10ish on the weekends and cancels my original statement of being able to have a nice conversation.  However, before the music gets turned way up and it gets packed with college students, the inside has a really great ambiance.I've only tasted a few small bites on the menu, but they seem to have a really great offering, including desserts.  I'd recommend Boltini for a date night or a night out with the girls.",

                "review": "Bacaro is a restaurant that I would reserve for a special occasion....or just to treat yourself to something a little different.  My favorite is the Market Monday prix fixe menu with ingredients selected from the saturday farmers market.  to go from fresh local ingredients on saturday morning to a full 5 course meal and wine pairings by monday night is pretty spectacular.  The last couple market night meals that i have been to have been around 40 dollars, and for an additional 25, you can get some awesome wines (highly recommended). The courses are so elegantly prepared with amazing presentation and you won't go home hungry.  I've noticed the dishes are a little too salty for my taste... actually, they're consistently salty to me (but then again this is coming from someone who barely ever salts their food) but i think you can get around it by indulging less in the amazing sauces.  and the desserts-- so delicious.  the desserts truly capture the seasons and the feel of the weather so perfectly.  I honestly don't know a better way to start the week!  if you have a bad case of the mondays, treat yourself to some bacaro.  and your spirits will be lifted. I have gone several times and enjoyed several of the menu items, and a few market nights (i hear they're introducing an occasional VEGETARIAN!!!! market menu!!) and i have never been disappointed.  The service is great, and they are very attentive.  Some servers are more knowledgeable about the wines and others know a little more about the food and preparation, but overall, they are a pleasant and fun to talk to group.  If you ask them a question and they don't know the answer, they are probably equally curious to know the answer as well-- meaning they will find you an answer even if it means hounding the chef :-) I think you definitely get what you pay for.  and for a city like champaign, bacaro is definitely a lovely gem.",

Great atmosphere, dimly lit, very nice.Service: 5 stars... we found the service to be extremely high caliber without being snooty.  We ate at NOMI in Chicago a few weeks ago and the service was comparable.  Quality and Kind... just the kind of service we adore.Food: PERFECT.  I'm not a \"foody\" but I adore good food.  The octopus was the best I've ever had.  The gnocchi was incredibly savory.  My husband tried the steak and I had the lamb special.  Both were FANTASTIC.  Wine suggestion: 4.5 Stars.  Wine was good, not great.  I'm not sure if we failed to describe what we wanted.  Would be nice to have some descriptions in the wine menu.  We've been to several nice restaurants in Chicago that provided descriptions of at least a subset of wine choices.  This is such a minor point though.We did not eat dessert as we were stuffed.I can't say enough good things about this very very special restaurant.  I'm just disappointed we took so long to finally get around to eating there.  We will be back... this is now my favorite restaurant in Champaign Urbana!!",

The Pinot Noir was delightful and the Cab Sauv was decent as well.With wine, we had a cheese plate with 5 cheeses and plenty of bread.For dinner, the risotto with rabbit was tasty.Dessert was a red velvet ice cream cake.  It was okay.  Bacaro used to have a panna cotta that was memorable to the point where, it was the one item I truly wanted to have again when returning to this spot.  Oh well, maybe next time.Overall, a great spot for good food and drink.",

The soup was merely OK and the spaghetti completely underwhelming (bland, in a runny sauce) and a huge disappointment.  I also felt that I was missing a spoon to easier roll the spaghetti in, and I don't really see the point of being given a knife instead.  Finally the Malbec I ordered (by the glass) simply shouldn't be on the menu in a fine dining restaurant.To complete my negative experience, everything on the menu was 2 to 4 dollars more expensive than the already high prices posted on their \"sample menu\" online.   To be fair, the service was fine (although not extraordinary) but obviously couldn't compensate for the rest.",

Not enough to send it back but one more grain of salt and I would have refused to eat it.  My companion suffered the same fate.  The wine list was either very expensive, they did not have it or Slovenian, not sure what's up with that.  We ended up drinking beer because we could not find anything we liked.

                "review": "Food was excellent but did not have a great experience with waitress. Table of 8, we all ordered tasting menu with wine pairings.  Wine came out about 10 min after our food on a few courses which left us unable to experience the \"pairing\" as you should. We politely and discreetly asked her to bring wine out with or right before food and I think that ticked her off. After that, she was aloof, barely explained the wine or the dishes we were being served. Water was slow to be refilled. The real kicker was the 20% automatic gratuity she added after tax on our bill! When we asked to speak to the manager, she told us \" he's busy dining with a client\". Say what??? I believe your customers are your priority! We asked a different waiter to see if he could find the manager and low and behold, out he came!  Tainted our experience and maybe our waitress was just having a bad day but when you are dropping that kind of money on dinner- you had better train your wait staff on how to properly serve and deal with customers.  It was a shame because from the chef end- he did a great job of making delicious and interesting food- it's just too bad no one explained it well or delivered it professionally.Just wanted to post an update. We received a very kind letter from owner/ manager apologizing for our experience and gave us a generous gift certificate to try them again.  We definitely will give them another chance. Again- the food is amazing and we want to see them succeed.",

I've been to Italy, and this ISN'T Italian...I suppose the entire visit was lackluster. The decor had a lot to be desired, but the wait staff were great. However, once we ordered wine (and, by the old menu at least, were supposed to receive the standard 4oz glass) things went downhill. While we were savoring the tiny portion in our glasses, the bartender was doing his best to overfill the glasses of the pretty girls at the bar. When questioned, we were told \"they asked for doubles.\" Who orders a double Merlot? We chose what appeared to be a special at the time: a smoked duck panini. What arrived at the table was a glorified ham and cheese sandwich. No, I'm not complaining about the sandwich itself, but they had substituted ham instead of smoked duck, then claimed that I wouldn't know the difference. I'm not sure if it was just this visit or the one that followed that biased me, but I'll never return.",

The servers and bartenders were knowledgeable and attentive.  We were there on a Monday so we were able to enjoy the Market Monday tasting menu, and I have to say, each dish was delicious.  Each dish was seasonal and had a great blend of flavors; I couldn't pick a dish that I didn't like.  We opted for the wine pairing and each wine matched the dish it was served with very well.  Wine has been a hobby of mine for a number of years but my wife is just getting into it, and she was blown away by the taste difference the pairings made.  I think the reviews stating that this restaurant was 'snooty' or that the service was slow are from people who don't truly understand what this restaurant is.  We spent 2 hours eating our 5 course meal.  It's a place where dining is an experience.  Come here expecting that, and come hungry.  Any complaints about small portion sizes must be coming from people ordering a la carte.  We'll be back the next time we want to have a fancy date night, without question.",

If you put the restaurant together as a whole package including the ambiance, the uniqueness of the food, and culinary innovation you would get a 3 star restaurant, however the flip side is that the culinary flavors do not resemble anything like the gastronomic experience you get when you dine at Next in Chicago or Charlie Trotters when it was still open. You pay quite a premium for the dish that are notably small. Our dinner meeting was held at this location. There is plenty of meter parking, just remember to not go over or you will likely be ticketed. I started my meal with the wagyu beef stew which had smoked potato and a bone marrow crostini. I can honestly say the crostini was amazing with bone marrow that offered an amazing umami flavoring, however the actual stew was salty, the beef was not tender by any means sort of tasting like a dinty moore stew. This cost 13 dollars and the portion size was very small. My main entree for 33 dollars was the grilled lobster tail with kale, crispy black truffle polenta, and additional lobster claw and pieces of lobster on the side with a acidic lemon tasting sauce. Once again the portion size was quite small as you see from my picture. I don't believe you get the whole lobster tail as it looked like 1/2 of a lobster tail. There was a piece of claw meat on the side and the other side was shredded lobster meat. The lobster was cooked well, tender and well flavored with the black truffle polenta balancing the seafood, however the attempt at the different texture from the arugula/kale along with the soft polenta and the lobster did not work. Our meal ended with a flourless chocolate cake with blood orange champagne foam and pomegranate jelly. The grapefruit foam hit the spot, but again the cake was a sliver and for that cost you would think the portion would be bigger. Due to the long wait for the waiter to bring the dessert menu, I ended up getting my first parking ticket in Champaign. So I agree the flavors and small portion size at this price do not make this a place that I will frequent. As another yelper said, if you want to impress your date this maybe an interesting place to try, however I am going to try to find another culinary gem elsewhere.Pros: local sustained food, changing menuCons: VERY expensive, small portion size- I left hungry, taste and texture just does not work for some dishesHidden deals:If you really want to impress your date, try the 7 course tasting menu at 85 dollars. I don' t know if that is a deal but at least you get to try everything for $$$",

Yes, despite the fact that there is a lot of mediocre food in the area, it's not the area's fault. Champaign-Urbana has fantastic terroir. There are many producers nearby making food that is world-class and Bacaro uses these ingredients to great effect. I LOVED the goat cheese salad and my rich creamy risotto. Fried sweetbreads were luscious. My boyfriend's chicken with chicken liver was delicious. I guess the only complaint is that the prices here are the same as in NYC...",

The servers are among the most professional in the C-U area. The food is genuinely sophisticated. However Bacaro's commitment to local, seasonal ingredients, while being one of its strengths, is also one of its greatest weaknesses. The menu at Bacaro is constantly changing based on what ingredients they stock. This tends to result in inconsistent dishes whose preparations are constantly changing. Of three visits I've eaten some bad, ok and great meals.Visit 1:Had halibut with some kind of crust in a mint-gazpacho. The fish was fresh and of excellent quality. This was frustrating however because the fish was coated in a greasy crust that became soggy from the fish sitting in the mint gazpacho. The gazpacho was also greasy and was not pleasantly minty. What could have been a complex, herbaceous broth, wound up tasting like greasy mouthwash. Fantastic ingredients but badly executed prep.Visit 2:Valentine's Day prix-fixe. Three courses all of which were delicious. The appetizer was some kind mediterranean type salad if I recall with olives and I think preserved lemon. Delicious and fresh! My main was halibut again, with some kind of vanilla saffron sauce. The fish was perfectly cooked and the sauce was complex and homey. My girlfriend got the steak and it was of great quality with a strong preparation to match. The dessert was a chocolate torte with blood orange sorbet- good flavors that were well-executed.Visit 3:Pork loin with mustard spaetzle. The spaetzle were delicious! I could eat that spaetzle every day. The pork however was DRY. Really, really dry. I was trying to conserve the mustard sauce on the plate in order to make sure there was enough to get on each slice of pork. It was that dry. So in closing out of three, expensive visits, the food has been good maybe 1.5 times- with me being able to say I enjoyed one complete meal (valentine's day) and the side of one of my mains (the spaetzle). If the food was consistent, Bacaro would be an easy 5-stars. Hopefully they can strike a balance moving forward between rotating fresh, seasonal ingredients and maintaining a consistently-executed menu.",

In fact, I'm happy to say that my dinner there was on a par with my best dining experiences in NYC.First and foremost: the food. My boyfriend and I decided to share a bunch of dishes. For appetizers, we ordered the fresh mozzarella with heirloom tomatoes and pesto, as well as the roasted suckling pig with homemade sauerkraut: they were both absolutely delicious (don't miss the suckling pig!). We then shared one entree: we got the braised pork shank, which came with sauteed spinach, mushrooms, bacon, and fig sauce: soooo good! The portions are not huge, but two appetizers and one entree turned out to be enough food. For dessert, we got the panna cotta with fresh fruit: simple but just as outstanding. That was some seriously great food!!As Bacaro is also a wine lounge, their wine selection is quite extensive. We got a sampler of three wines by the glass for $14, all of which were pretty good. Not to forget the 10yo port we got with our dessert (very generous pour...), which was good also.Service was great, ambiance was great (although it's a shame that the place was so empty)... it was really a great dinner (sure, it was not cheap, but entirely worth it!). By far the restaurant in Champaign, in my opinion. I'll definitely be back.",

Second, my gnocchi tasted like it came out of a Bertolli bag in the frozen section at a supermarket and the sauce was inundated with salt. After trying some parmesan, which was freshly grated (about the only positive), and pepper flakes, I realized that nothing could save the dish. If you want to pay Chicago prices to impress a date, you can try Bocaro, but don't expect more than oversalted Champaign food.",

                "review": "This is my favorite place to dine in Champaign-Urbana. On our most recent visit, we ordered a few things from the new menu, all of which seemed fantastic--it was hard to choose. We had greens, octopus salad, gnocchi, and the scallop entree. Each course was just as delicious as the last. The scallop entree is so clever and very well executed--it's such a treat to have perfectly cooked, high quality seafood in the middle of Illinois. Chef Drew worked his magic with this dish. There are \"scallop potatoes\" on the plate, which blend in and look just like the actual scallop next to it. Biting into the potato is an experience, especially if you're expecting a scallop! They are divine. I could eat a whole plate of just the potatoes, I swear.We were too full to order dessert, but everything I've had in the past from the dessert menu has been phenomenal--creative, elegant and fun at the same time. Their pastry chef Lindsey is awesome! As for wine, I didn't have anything beyond Prosecco on my last visit, but I usually just allow the staff to select something for me. It's always on the money.The service is always impeccable as well--smooth, engaging when it needs to be and with a huge attention to detail. Connor took care of us on our most recent visit. He's a truce service professional--knowledgable, eager to offer suggestions and advice with the menu, but allows the experience to flow naturally. We had such a nice time with him! Plus, Julie is always there to make sure everyone is having a perfect experience.I highly recommend bacaro to anyone who is visiting CU who is looking for a polished, smooth, fine-dining experience. I would also steer visitors that way if they are just looking for a place to relax with a glass of wine. And for those of you who live in this community and have yet to try bacaro, I would say do yourself a favor and go! Treat yourself!",

We chose to do the tasting menu which was about 6 courses, complete with a cheese course and dessert.  I paired it with the wines too. The wine list was definitely impressive.  Lots of interesting wines at very fair prices. They are considered a wine bar, so I was hoping for a good list.  But I was impressed with the prices, there were many bottles on the list for under $30 which is always great to me.  It's easy to fill a list with great expensive bottles, but it is indeed very difficult to pick a variety of great wines at reasonable prices. The wines paired perfectly with each dish, I was so happy.  About the food... I was just so impressed.  The octopus over german potato salad was unlike anything I've ever had, and just so delicious.  Yes, it does sound strange but it was so well done, and the octopus was cooked just perfectly, it was so tender.  I was so thrilled the chef has decided to include this as one of the courses.  We had a big scallop seared and served over corn salsa which was almost sweet but just delicious.  We also had braised rabbit, which again was tender and also quite flavorful sitting in a pool of broth, with some tomatoes, and homemade pasta.  The rib eye for the main course was flavorful and again very tender.  The cheese course was fun.  And I loved thin very rich slice of chocolate dessert.  To be honest, I was simply amazed at the quality of these dishes.  Sure it is a more expensive dinner out, but for the quality and caliber of the dishes, it is a steal!! This is easily one of my most memorable and favorite dining experiences.  Easily 5 stars for Bacaro!!",

Really kudos there. Portions are small - you probably would expect that in this sort of establishment. We opted for a la carte options.  I don't mind paying top dollar for great food, but the total for two people prix fixe with wine substitution is $240 before tip.  Now again, I don't mind paying, but there are michelin starred restaurants in fabulous cities that are not -this- expensive.  This is Champaign, a small but charming place in central Illinois.  Wife and I had a bottle of wine, two pasta entrees, and two desserts to the tune of about $110 after a nice tip (20-25%) - You can eat reasonably here if you avoid the prix fixe menu. The food was great.  Everything was jam packed with flavor, perfectly cooked, and elegantly presented. Would definitely return for another 'date night' or special occasion.  Definitely not a place to go for dinner if you're looking for grub, though.",

Either way you should call ahead and see.  I have no complaints about oversalting like other reviewers, perhaps they listened?  The malbec we drank with dinner was a nice random choice.The bad:  Our waitress was new.  At least I hope she was new.  The service was great but she wasn't as familiar with the menu or wine list as someone working at that caliber of restaurant should be.The manhattans were terrible.  I suspect Bacaro of being yet another restaurant who thinks they should have their own special manhattan, with exotic bitters and cherry juice and... do you think you're going to save me from scurvy or something?  I want bourbon, bitters, and sweet vermouth, and go easy on everything but the bourbon.  This is no time for creativity.The dessert menu is stupid.  Who follows octopus and rabbit with banana bread and ice cream?  Hire a dessert chef.I would totally recommend Bacaro if you need \"fancy dinner out.\" Sometimes I do.  Sometimes I have parents who need impressing.",

On the whole, the food was very good, but the overall experience fell short of my expectations for other dinners of similar quality that I have had elsewhere.   First, the atmosphere of the restaurant, while nice, did not strike me as anything special.  That said, this could be a product of where I sat.   Even though I placed a reservation close to a week in advance, I found myself sitting at the table nearest to the kitchen with my date.  While she had a view of downtown Champaign and the restaurant's interior, my own view was of a row of temperature controlled wine racks and a junky-looking electrical socket near the kitchen's entrance.     For the appetizer, we had the pizzetta, which didn't strike me as anything special:  just bread, cheese, grape tomatoes, onion, and bacon.   Our entrees-- the braised rabbit and the grouper-- were better, but as others have mentioned, the portions were quite small, even for a restaurant focused on contemporary fine-dining.  Thanks to a bottle of wine and a second helping of bread, nobody left hungry, but with the final bill clocking in at close to $120, it was hard not to walk away with a sense that some of that money could be better spent elsewhere.         Ultimately, in giving Bacaro three stars, I am rating it in the context of other \"fine-dining\" establishments.  The restaurant's chefs clearly know how to cook, and their wait staff is very well trained, but I don't think that either the food nor the space warrants the price that they have set on it.",

I always preferred Radio Maria, Escobar or some other place for a nice meal. So before we set out on a Friday night for Bacaro, I decided to Yelp it and I was (and still am) very suspicious of a few of the reviews.  Here was a place with lots of 1 & 2 star reviews and yet a couple of 5 star reviews, written in great length and gushing detail by Yelpers for whom this was their only review.  So who writes their first and only review in great length and never mentions anything they ordered, just summarizing it as an excellent restaurant, then never subsequently reviews any other restaurant?  I may be a cynic, but it raises red flags....So, we set off to do our own independent research:  Three people on a Friday night.  The place is full, we get one of a couple of available tables, with no reservations.  The waitress was wonderful.  My first requirement to enjoy a restaurant experience is good service, and she was great.  She knew the menu, she was unequivocal when we asked her what she liked.  She kept her distance and watched us for cues, never interrupting a conversation and never rushing us nor ever making us wait.The wine list is huge, the drink list is equally huge, but both are very pricey by Champaign standards. My wife's martini was a very full glass, all the way up to the \"c\" section as we Assembly Hall fans would say.We had a risotto special with fish \"for the table\", one mixed green salad, and one fried pork belly starter.  The pork belly was $10 and was the size of a large marshmallow in the center of a 12 inch plate, humorous by its dinkyness. But good, like a chunk of fried bacon fat.Then we had three entrees, all were very good.  Mine was the grouper ($28) and frankly I don't recall my companion's meals because we also knocked down one martini and two bottles of Cote D' Rhone between the three of us.  The Cote D' Rhone was $28/bottle and the lowest price wine on the list.  Several other wines could be had in the high $30's, and then the rest of the list was north of $40.One apple pie ala mode later and the three of us were out of there for $192 before tip; and she was worth the $40 tip we left, so by the end of the day it approached $77 per person.So if you start a Yelp review at a three, this place gets one more star for having a great server, one star for being in DT Champaign and being beautiful inside & out, including cloth hand towels in the loo.  Then I'll knock one star off for being too pricey for the market, but if Yelp allowed half-stars I'd give Bacaro 4.5.",

We didn't go for the menu tasting but instead we ordered a couple of entrees. My wife had the chicken and I had the ribeye. Both were cooked very nicely and the unique ingredients made the meals slightly different, but for the prices they charge the taste of each was really just average. My steak wasn't very tender or all that flavorful. Her chicken was cooked decently enough but again the flavor was really just average. I thought maybe because we were there on the Sunday before Labor Day, that maybe it was an off night. But I just couldn't get past the fact that when a place must such a high price on their menu, there really shouldn't be such a thing as an \"Off Night\". The atmosphere and the waiter we had were very nice. So here is my take. Wait staff 3-4 starsAtmosphere 4-5 starsWine list 4-5 StarsBeer list 3-4 starsMenu 4-5 stars Food 2-3 stars I probably wouldn't go here again just because its priced to high to take a chance on a very average meal.

We were forced to listen to a guest M.D. present a PowerPoint talk on male sexual dysfunction for almost an hour while we were having dinner. It was so loud that we couldn't have a conversation at our own table. It was a very unpleasant dinner. A good restaurant is not just about food, but also about ambience. The atmosphere was absolutely horrible for the customers who were not part of the conference. The soup was also extremely salty. This place tries to be fancy, certainly in price, but it is only mediocre in both taste and atmosphere.",

The food however was just a bit too out of the ordinary for me. I prefer classic dishes done to a high standard over the creative and stronger-flavored inventions they had here. I found the food more interesting than delicious, which in the end left me a little disappointed.If your palette is bored, adventurous, and experienced you might like Bacaro, I'm not quite there yet.",

They seem to be particular to detail, which is a plus to me!The wine is top notch too.Honestly, anyone who finds Bacaro pretentious must be insecure, or needs to be more social.

We shared a couple of appetizers and entrees and everyone loved every dish we had.  The resounding favorite was the octopus appetizer which was tender and flavor- full.   The beef tenderloin was charred nicely on the exterior and was cooked to a perfect pink.  The seared scallops with Myers Lemon were refreshing and light.  The gnocci was a showstopper as was the risotto with black truffles and the duck breast.  We asked Thad, the chef, to choose a bottle of wine based on our menu selections which enhanced the experience!  The entrees run between $25-$32 and makes a great choice for a special occasion.",

We ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, and, because I wasn't feeling very adventurous, chose the oven roasted chicken as my entre.  Overall, I found both these dishes a little too salty (maybe the chef was just having an off night?).  The portions are modest, but you would probably expect a little more for the price you're paying.  They did have a decent cheesecake and the check came out with a couple yummy chocolate chip meringues, but overall I guess I was a little disappointed.In consensus with what many others have said, service was very attentive, but I felt it was almost to the point of pretentiousness.  Based on this experience alone, I would most likely not recommend Bacaro's nor dine here again, but I really don't want to dislike this establishment and would like to come back again sometime in the future and give it another chance.  Until then, I say stick with Radio Maria.",

Just when I thought I couldn't eat any thing more fabulous, I had the peanut butter ice cream, which was amazing. I went to Bacaro again tonight (Tuesday April 7) and started with the octopus appetizer, which was startling in a fantastic way in its tomato sauce with shaved chorizo sausage--who knew such flavors could brilliantly mix? I followed this with the strip steak, which exceeded expectations in its deliciousness and perfect serving preparation and size. Although full, I had to finish this outstanding meal with the never-to-disappoint, peanut butter ice cream. It is velvety smooth.

Overall, it is a consistently good restaurant in terms of service.  However, there are certain dishes that are more tasty than others.  I would definitely recommend trying Bacaro at least twice in an attempt to determine the types of dishes you like and don't like.",

Food ranges from very good to amazing.  We've never had a bad meal at bacaro.You can throw down a lot of money here, but you don't need to.  The bar is great, they have reasonable and interesting wines by the glass, and you can have a few appetizers or smaller courses and leave without spending too much and but still feeling like you had a special night out.Highly recommended.",

The pairing was correct and the wine went well with our meals.  It was somewhat amazing also the fact that it wasn't a very expensive wine that was suggested.This is a very good place to eat in the Champaign area.  The reason I gave it 5/5 (instead of 4/5) is because even though the food is a little over priced in my mind, the service, atmosphere, and location lend to it receiving a 5/5.",

Venue used to be a hookah bar, and it hasn't been updated much since. In the front area they still have large booths utilized for hookah smoking.  Went in on a Tuesday night. Had about 5 people sitting outside, 10 in the back karaoke / dance floor area, and another 15 or so lingering around the bar. The space felt really big for the crowd size. Bartender was prompt and friendly. Limited beers on tap selection (I think I saw 2-3 taps). The patio seemed like it could be a really fun spot. I'd be open to going back and try to catch it at an earlier time to see what the crowd would be like.",

                "review": "Clark Bar is a casual, neighborhood bar.  Don't expect much of a college scene here.  And because the bar is off the main strip for downtown Champaign, you won't find the modern urban socialite scene, either.  Most nights are relatively low-key, though they do host live music from time to time.   The place is deceptively large as rooms are sectioned off to allow for cozy, private settings for small groups.  I love to sit in their patio area in the summer, which also has a layout that allows for some privacy among groups, including a small screened porch (for people who fear insects).The alcohol selection here is probably not indie rock enough to impress beer elitists.  They offer standard beers and well drinks, but there are no obscure microbrews.For some confusing reason, Clark Bar is listed as a \"tapas bar\" on Yelp.  I think that this classification is somewhat misleading as tapas evoke a distinctly trendy, European sensibility.  While the tone of the food verges into tapas territory at times, the ambiance at Clark Bar probably wouldn't be suitable for an elegant dinner date.  The menu ranges from standard fare (burger and fries) to surprisingly exotic.  My carnivorous friends rave about the ribs, which are served exclusively on Wednesday and Friday.  Once I stopped by and found fried ALLIGATOR on the menu, an exceedingly rare delicacy outside of the deep south (ESPECIALLY in Champaign, IL).  Any appetizer they make with shrimp is absolutely perfect.  As a fair warning, some dishes are only offered seasonally.The variation you see in terms of food might also apply to the clientele you meet here.  Most nights the bars is populated by absolutely ordinary local people.  However, during one surreal visit, I watched as a stream of people dressed in Victorian hoop skirts and silk waistcoats marched in.  Not an experience you'd run across at most bars.  Apparently Clark Bar was hosting a meeting of the local steam punk club that evening.I'd recommend Clark Bar for anyone who isn't scared of a bar with a \"townie\" vibe.  This unassuming establishment serves some of the most interesting food in town, depending on the cook's mood.  For those who love to people-watch, there are fewer prime locations in the area.",

Clark Bar is truly one of those places. The building itself is sort of hidden from the rest of the downtown bar scene. The building is actually a Victorian-styled house that was remodeled into a bar. I can't really speak about the drink selections... I'm a simple beer and whiskey man. The domestic drafts are $1 on Thursdays, but might actually the special every day.

There are a ton of rooms, a kind of living-room type space with couches for relaxed conversation and live music, a somewhat crowded and annoyingly narrow bar area for boozing it up, and a music room with a stage and some peripheral seating for karaoke, music and dancing.Great prices for beer ($3 Blue Moon!), clean bathrooms, and a great time for my first karaoke experience! If I lived in Champaign/Urbana, I could see making this a frequent stop on my Friday night circuit.",

I wouldn't call it the most visually appealing of the late-night scene, but there's definitely fun to be had there, and if pool tables and dart boards aren't you thing, give Clark a shot.

I ordered the bulgogi bento box and boy was he right!  It was excellent!   I inhaled everything in a matter of minutes.... Not sure what everything was (bulgogi, tempura, rice, a macaroni type of salad and then these gelatinous type of things) but it was great!   I also ordered the kimchi soup and that was great too but it took me a while to finish because it was almost too spicy for me.  Everything came out to $11.  A welcome addition to Champaign!

Suffice it to say with one exception, the food was excellent and I'll definitely be returning often to eat here.  Review is based upon taste, service, and value metrics.First taste.  We ordered a boodae jungol, corn pahjun, egg jjim, and some spicy dahk bbq stuff.  I'm going to go ahead and mention the \"exception\" mentioned earlier.  Anything on their menu which is a hot plate or whatever, with spicy bulgogi, pork or chicken... I would stay away from all of those items.  Our dahk bbq hot dish thing was an abomination.  The chicken was not cleaned, so we were eating huge pieces of fat, unrendered skin.  And on top of that, they cooked the chicken, but they did not get rid of the grisly cooked chicken blood.  It should be a standard practice to clean the chicken, and once its cooked to skim off any grisly cooked blood so that the customer isn't eating that.  But every mouthful of it is either fat and skin, paired with a goopy, and grisly cooked chicken blood consistency.  It was basically inedible.  I'll go ahead and throw in the value aspect of these dishes as well.  At the 14 dollar price point, everything in that section of the menu is the biggest rip off.  Portion size did not at all justify the price point, paired with the horrible blandness, fat, unrendered skin, and grisly chicken blood... if I could give a 0/5 on the basis of this dish alone I would.  But the fact of the matter is, everything in that submenu of hot dishes is a complete rip off, and until they double the portion sizes of all of those dishes, and remedy their preparation issues, I would stay far away from all of those items.NOW, with that horrible exception out of the way... the good news is, the corn pahjun, egg jjim, and all of the ban chan they gave us was absolutely perfect and excellent.  The Corn pahjun, where it looked WAY overdressed and oversauced, it was actually quite balanced.  A little more acid in the sauce would have been nice, but it was delicious nonetheless.  The egg jjim was more or less a test of execution of a classic ban chan, which they did well.  It was delicious and well prepared.  The boodae jungol was also quite excellent.  I think my defacto standard for boodae jungol is at san soo gab san in Chicago.  And on the basis of taste, Yori Q's interpretation of it was right on par.  It was just enough spicy.  They did put a bunch of \"cheap meat\" in it like spam, and hotdogs, and didn't put any premium meat in it, like chadulbaegee, and put VERY LITTLE samgyepsahl, so it didn't really meet expectations as far as ingredients both in protein and veggies, but it at least tasted good.  So aside from the exception that is that dahk bbq, (which should get a -50 out of 5), I will give the rest of the meal a 5/5.  Very delicious.Service.  Service was great.  A guy named Andrew was our server.  He was excellent, warranting a giant tip.  If you go to Yori Q, request that Andrew be your server, he was excellent, knowledgeable, and friendly.  He will no doubt make your dining experience improve on his demeanor, and excellence as a server alone.  In general the food was ordered, and came out in a short time.  Our server was attentive, refilling our drinks and ban chan, and being receptive to our comments on the food.  5/5 easily on service.Some things they could have done better with our boodae jungol is to cut the ramen noodles, and provided a better array of veggies, and premium meats in it.  The extremely long ramen noodles made it impossible to serve out the boodae into smaller cups without lifting your arm 5 feet above the wok, all the while hot boodae juice is falling and splashing all over your clothes.  Value.  So again, with the hot dishes as an exception, meaning the dahk bbq we got, and every other item in that submenu, I easily give Yori Q a 5/5 on value.  Though I will say, if they do not correct the portion sizes and preparation problems with those dishes the next time we go, their overall rating will drop on this review to a 2/5.  But the boodae jungol was reasonably priced since it was delicious, and the appetizers were not terribly overpriced.  Even with the horrible dahk bbq, our ticket was $52 before tip, which, if you remove the dahk bbq from the equation, it was very reasonable.  So again, aside from the hot dishes, bbq dishes sub menu, Yori Q gets a 5/5 on value.  All in all a 4/5 experience I think.  They will get repeat business from us.  And we'll see if they lower the prices on the hot dishes, double the portion sizes, and correct the preparation issues.  Hopefully I won't be coming back to this review and stamping a 2/5 stars on it.  All things considered, Yori Q is a good place to go, just be sure you ask people what to get before you go, lest you end up with a mouth full of creamy cooked chicken blood, unrendered chicken skin, and chicken fat to eat with your rice.",

After trying all the korean restaurants in town, I must say I was used to having to settle for restaurants with positive aspects and mediocre aspects, food wise, service, ambiance, price. Tried this place twice before leaving and both times I had a great experience. Having lived in Los Angeles I know the standards for korean restaurants pretty well. This place excelled in all aspects. For being a brand new restaurant the service was very attentive and fast, which is unusual for restaurants with training staff. They made sure we were satisfied with our meal. The ambiance hasn't change much since the last asian restaurant in the location but was given a rather simple but clean facelift. Ive tried the spicy chicken stew, naegmyon and other dishes and all of them where very flavourful and generous portions, especially considering other korean restaurants in town. If the service and food quality persist in this restaurant it will definitely be the go to place for everyone in town craving korean food.",

I had the dolsat bibambap for my entree and it wasn't the best. I don't eat a lot of bibambap but this one had way too much rice and not enough stuff. There were also only about 4 or 5 very small pieces of bulgogi. I know bibambap is vegetable focused, but this was just disappointing. The worst part was the fried egg in the bibambap. It arrived at our table with a completely rock solid yolk. Even worse, the bowl next to mine's yolk was not only rock solid, but also broken, leaving a dried up trail around the bowl. Not good. However, the pork neck bone soup was well received and pleasantly spicy. The bulgogi entree was also very good, generous portion of beef to make up for the complete lack of beef in the bibambap. I didn't try the hot pot which they are supposedly known for. I'd recommend this place for bulgogi or soups/hot pot, but I'd stay away from the bibambap.",

Everything tasted great and, most importantly, the service was amazing. I was there for maybe 45 minutes and I was asked if I needed anything at least 6 times.The bad:While everything was great, the bibimbap left more to desire in regards to the bulgogi. It was one of those instances where I felt like I took 3 bites of meat and the rest was rice and veggies. But it was only $10, so can't complain too much. Overall, Yori Q is a great Korean food option in the area and I'll definitely be back eventually.",

On the bright side, their corn jeon is delicious. Also, their seulong tang is delicious. My cousin got the ramen last time and I think they put cheese in the ramen. He said it was okay - probably not recommended.  I would recommend this place for certain dishes and hopefully the recipe does not change.",

Second time went for a cheaper choice bearing in mind that sometimes price does not justify quality.

Don't expect anything very healthy here..there are a few salads and a veggie wrap, but all have cheese or dressing (which I guess you could get on the side...).  Onion rings are good, I've heard the mac-n-cheese is tasty, and many of the burgers are on wonderful pretzel rolls.  As a note, they have something called \"haus sauce\", which is just their buffalo sauce, so don't be fooled.  Never been here during peak evening hours, so I can't comment on that, but an ok place for lunch and a beer.",

                "review": "I dunno if it was just me and my spiritual ora while in Firehaus, but I always got hit on by a random girl on the weekends here. I felt kind of bad because I was already in a very committed relationship aka married. But really, I wasn't sending misleading creepy signals or being charming either. For the longest time I thought it was the smell of my hair wax I was using to style my bed hair when I would go out to socialize with friends. But I tested this theory numerous times in other cities and no dice. Yes, the wife was not with me at other venues.Investigatively (not a real word)... I think on certain weekends, the local gals come here to find their knight and shining armor to take them away from the small town. But here is the thing, u will never know if she is a local until she tells you. But I came here enough to observe and identify how to spot these rare and undiscovered people. First off, they are extremely beautiful, like the tone of their skin was almost natural and organic... unmanipulated by the city or fake UV rays. They dress differently, no labels and no blig. And here is the kicker, they talk differently. Their topics of discussion are not layered from the dry vocabulary of the bullshit literary material University students are being brain washed in (this includes myself). One big clue seemed to be the type of questions they asked. University girls typically asked questions like what are you studying, where have you interned, what year in school are you? But I noticed the local asked a key differentiating question: where are you originally from?---if you decode this question, it's underlying motive is can you take her away from her boring hometown.Keep in mind, this place is not swarming with these type of treasures. A treasure is a treasure to be found. I write this review because I hope to read or hear about somebody finding their future other half at Firehaus. A smart city kid that swoops a small town gal off her feet and make a ton of babies after graduating.So best wishes to you bachelors, go to Firehaus with new purpose. Cheers! I'll be expecting a wedding invitation shortly. LOL...",

Now what really attracted me today was it's deal! For $4.99 you can get 10 delicious wings that matches that if Buffalo Wild Wings! Of course, the deals do Cary day to day so you may just have to swing by the place very now and them to see if the daily special flows your boat. But when it does, boy is it worth it!The waitresses are extremely fast to react and the food also comes with speed. Their bottles and draft selection are humongous, and their prices are pretty decent too! Definitely checkout the place!",

Based purely on food alone - I give this place 3-stars - it's average. However, it deserves an extra star for its service.

We loved the somewhat clean feel to Firehaus and the cheap drinks.  I went back this weekend for my brothers graduation and it is now an absolute madhouse on the weekends.  It's still a pretty solid place, but it has become more of your typical Champaign bar.",

Luckily we stumbled around and found this place open for dinner. Most of the students had gone home for the holidays so it was a perfect fit as this is not really a \"family restaurant\" but a bar with bar food. We ordered the cheese curds which for 5.99 was very little cheese curds and not really that good. They taste like they came from the freezer. The royale burger was a lot burger with double meat patty topped with egg, cheese, bacon, and a pretzel roll. It is definitely not a steak house burger but it was juicy and with good meat flavors. Overall it was good, but not very memorable. The one major plus is if you drink they have quite an extensive bar menu with daily drink specials.Pros: daily drink specials, lots of bar foodCons: the food is okay, I can't say that it is the best bar food I have ever had. The cheese curds were a big let downHidden deals:Daily drink specials check out my picture of that menuDaily 10% discount for lunch for UI students and faculty Mon-Friday",

In our time at the Firehaus, we observed an incompetent management team. While the bartenders became busy trying to fill orders for their servers you could see patrons at the bar with empty glasses including ourselves.  Management was sitting at the end of the bar sipping on their sodas and barking orders at employees. At no time did the manager  attempt to help the bartenders and clear their backlog. As we were getting ready to leave we observed a member of the management team chewing out a member of the waitstaff to where she was in tears. This was done in front of a very crowded bar for all patrons to observe. Personally, I think this is a horrible time (middle of a shift) and place (in front of a crowded bar) for a reprimand to occur.   I think their management team is extremely unprofessional and feel for the employees under their leadership.",

Very attentive to us and made sure we got drinks and everything was accurate and super good. The downside is that we put in one appetizer, the pretzel bites.... and then 10 minutes later put in 2 other appetizers and out second order came out first. While we waited we were told multiple times that the kitchen staff misplaced the order and or it got put under another person's order. It took us almost an hour to get pretzel bites, a little crazy. Also we were stuck watching a 21-0 blowout game on one TV while an amazing game (not shown on any TVs) was on. We asked that they change the blowout game and the first guy we asked gave us an answer that screamed \"I don't care enough to make the change for you\". Super disappointing. All in all if/when I get back to Champaign for another game, I will not even have this place on my radar of places to stop at.",

The food is better than most other places on campus as far as bar and grill is concerned. Their best options are half priced wings on Sundays/Mondays, the Hazmat or FDNY wrap (1/2 priced on Saturdays), and their chili. Some things to note are that the waiting staff is usually new during the summer and leading into the fall. Give them some time to learn and adjust to the bar. It can be easy to get aggravated if you're there with a huge group drinking but everyone wants separate checks and the waiter mixes up drinks. Also, the appetizers aren't really worth it omitting the Firehaus fries. Most portions are simply to small for the list price. Side note: When the upstairs bar is open it really opens up the establishment. There is a second story outside deck as well as an outside alleyway (paved and meant to serve as a patio) to sit and dine outside.",

Whether that's a good or bad thing is up to you, but it was kind of a pain that I couldn't hear any of my friends from across the table.  I've been there a few times earlier in the week when it's less crowded, and it's been pretty enjoyable.Last word of advice:  avoid the amaretto stone sours.  Unless the person making mine messed something up, it just wasn't good.  It was bland and syrupy,",

I'd eat here probably once a week if not more and switch off between wings, salad, chicken tenders, or spinach artichoke dip. It was all amazing, every time.But sadly, my old stomping grounds have become disappointing.I came here back in May for a random visit and saw they added an AMAZING sandwich to the menu, the Southwest Chicken. Grilled chicken, provolone, pepper and onions, and avocado? YUM. Paired with onion rings and I knew this would be my new go-to on their menu.Flash forward to a couple weeks ago when I came down for Homecoming. My friends and I literally parked the car in a garage a block away and went straight to Firehaus. Ah, the nostalgia! The memories! THE GOOD FOOD!I ordered the Southwest Chicken with a side of onion rings, like I had been dreaming about all day. When it came out I was immediately disappointed to see they had replaced the fresh avocado slices with some sort of avocado PASTE. Yuck! It smelled and tasted bizarre so I scraped it off. Bye, delicious chicken sandwich! Now you are merely of slightly-above-average taste.The next day I came in for lunch, because who actually goes to Illini football games anymore? I decided to get a side salad and wings, and everyone at the table ordered a drink with their food. The waitress brought out everyone's drinks except mine, which I found strange since I had just ordered a bottle of Bud Light Platinum. After another server brought out everyone's food and not mine, I flagged down our server and the look on her face when I asked about my food was one of, \"Oh shit.\" So she ran away and came back a couple minutes later explaining she forgot to put in my order originally. Well, duh, I kind of got that. She apologized profusely and said I'd get a discount on my bill.The wings were worth the wait, honestly, and the salad was as good as I remembered. But then the part where my bill came? No discount. At this point we were rushing off to go to another bar and my friend was nice enough to just pay for my tab, but come on. If you're going to screw up my order and then promise a discount, deliver on it.Maybe I'm just picky, or maybe I expected more from a place I used to frequent. Or maybe it lost its shine. It pains me, Firehaus, but you only get 3 stars from me.",

I also subbed the house bun for a pretzel bun to kick this burger up a notch. The result is a mouthwatering combination of sauce, meat, cheese, and bun that is first-rate. If the beef was only a little more flavorful and juicy this campustown burger would be amongst some of the better I've had. Firehaus gets major points for being a campus bar that sports some gourmet grub, great drinks, and a fun atmosphere. If you're ever in home of the Illini Firehaus is a must.",

Our group of 10 was seated promptly and the waitress did an awesome job in accommodating our group. We came on a Thursday I think which meant $3 burger with AMAZINGGGGGG fries. Their fries are double fried so they have a great crispy crust. On top of that, they have a good selection of beer on tap to complement your meal.

But now, it's kicking ass and taking names and has a whole lot of loyal customers, and for that, I give this bar all sorts of props.Also, I just said \"props.\" Ew.Anyway, the really excellent thing about this bar is that it is CLEAN. Clean clean clean. Even on Unofficial, which is arguably the dirtiest day on campus all year, the bathrooms at Firehaus will be clean. The layout isn't my favorite as there aren't a whole lot of places to sit, but the beer garden is excellent, and the buffalo chicken sandwich (with pasta salad!) was pretty damned good.Of all the Cochrane bars on campus, this one is without a doubt. the best.",

I've always liked Firehaus but it was never one of my haunts.  I like how they have large tables, and how the front is open-air.  They have lots of daily drink specials, and the atmosphere isn't sketchy.  Dim lighting, very red in there.  Well I guess it is a firehouse.  Despite it \"looking\" nicer than some other campus bars (it's really just that it's newer, I'm sure), you are still going to run into some silly silly people.  Last time we were here, a drunk guy was talking to us and wouldn't leave, so we took his flip flops and hid them in the girls bathroom.  So you know, it's not a total class act of a bar, but it's pretty clean and well-maintaned compared to some of the other options.",

It's right on campus, huge inside and out, and full of people just wanting to have a good time. Prices were absurdly cheap, and drinks were not watered down. My only, minor complaint was the lack of bartenders making waits for drinks very long (sometimes nearing a half hour). If I come back to the Illinois campus, I'll for sure be stopping at Firehaus for a drink to start the night.",

                "review": "Party of 12 on a Saturday? Lets try BW in Savoy... oh wait, it's a UFC night. They didn't even offer a wait time, just sort of laughed and were like \"yeah right\". So, we're like \"where do you want to go?\" looked around (while standing outside bw) and there's restaurants all over the place. How about the BBQ place right next to Tucks... \"i don't like bbq\" why not \"i don't like bbq\" THEY HAVE OTHER THINGS!!! Applebees? It's right there... no... geebus... how about... (name every restaurant)... finally... BRIXX. She calls, yes, we can get in. Whoo hoo a decision!!!Drive down the street, drive around the building a couple times, hoping to find a parking spot. That may be the worst thing about BRIXX, is the parking is terrible. Go inside, seated right away. Oddly, only know 1 person who was working there, and she was the hostess (i believe). Menu's are passed. Beer list is perused. Hey, look, there's always a Triptych on tap. That's great. The draft list is all craft, and that's awesome. There are no macros on tap. I assume this is upsetting to many people the first (maybe only?) time they go there. \"What do you mean you don't have bud light on tap???\" I'd assume is asked by crusty old people. \"Back in my day, a restaurant would have Budweiser, Miller, Coors AND Pabst on tap! I suppose I can't even get a HAMM'S in here?!?!?!\" Hey, whaddyaknow, they have macros in bottles. \"Well, why didn't you tell me that?\"  Craft food deserves craft beer. The lady and I both order the Triptych, the Blue and the Gold. She believes it tastes better than when it was at the brewery, so that's odd. Beer is promptly served. It doesn't appear that it was in a frosty pint glass either, so that's good too. There is also craft rootbeer on tap, so that's cool. They seem to have some staples in intro craft, like Fat Tire, Sam Adams, but the list is nice. It's not going to be a place to go to for \"I've never even HEARD of this beer\" (from the craft beer drinkers) but the BMC drinkers will be exclaiming that, except in anger. I order the 4x4. So does the lady. The manager brings over a Mediterranean salad, apparently an extra one had been made, and he decided to bring it to our table (he must know i'm a yelper!... or maybe he's just nice). Bill eats the salad. Courtney eats the bread, she seemed to like the bread. Others at the table ordered other things. Court got the ravioli, the waitress was awesome and asked if she wanted the tomatoes on it, and court was like no. The waitress was awesome, did i mention that. She was like \"i'm a picky eater too, and you look like you'd be a picky eater\" which was really nice. There were 2 young boys in our group, and they went over and drew on the chalkboard, and one of the bussers brought them out extra chalk to draw with, and that was really nice. Man, those people were really nice. The pizzas come out. I devour mine. Apparently, the reason i don't really like pizza is the sauce. The 4x4 doesn't have red sauce, it's an olive oil. So, maybe that's why i don't like pizza. Who knew? I remember as a kid, eating some frozen pizzas, every now and then, one of those Tino's (or similar) would have a sauce that we would call \"watermelon pizza\". I also hate pizza hut. As a youth, when John and I would drive around Pontiac, we'd sometimes eat at pizza hut. Well, we'd drink... sometimes too much. It was then that i discovered the acidity in the pizza hut sauce is almost exactly the same acidity that is regularly in my stomach. So, when i'd throw up from drinking too much, it would taste exactly the same. As an adult, I don't drink to that point. So, the 4x4 was amazing. I don't do desert. Kansas was losing the first half of the game while I was there. I leave and they win by like 20, wtf? Tres Tinkle was having a great first half. I leave and suddenly Kansas remembers how to play?The 3 bean salad was great. Not a typical three bean salad either. Red beans, black beans and garbanzos (i realize everyone poops, but that doesn't mean i want to see chick pee's!)",

First, we were seated at a table directly in front of the swinging kitchen door. Upon being seated an emplyeed barreled out the door and smack into me. Then we ordered the Brixx Sticks and got them after about 20 minutes, first we thought they were cheese filled because the middle was gooey, then we realized our Brizz Sticks were basically raw. Sent them back and asked for new, upon waiting another 20 minutes we got our pizza...still no Brixx Sticks. We told our server just take them off the bill, the woman training our server did not like that and tried to convince us to take them to go even though we told her we didnt want them anymore as we already got our meal. Lastly, the pizza was undercooked and dry. My husbands pizza was significantly smaller than mine, all the pizzas are supposed to be 10\". He order his pizza without goat cheese and they put in on the pizza anyway. A friend of our was supposed to be running this place but passed away shortly before open. We really wanted to love this place, but we will probably never go back. The staff seamed nice but the food just wasn't cooked.",

                "review": "For being a pizza-rich town, we've been surprisingly short of wood-fired options. Now all of a sudden there are two, maybe a third on its way in downtown. This one is a franchise and doesn't surprise me that it's a bit mediocre. We tried it out after its first month of being open, figuring the kinks would be shaken out by then. It was a busy football night, but late, after the initial dinner crowd was winding down. We were seated by the hostess then abandoned for about 20 minutes, even though the place was not so busy that all the tables were filled. She was just distracted yakking with a pal. When finally discovered about to leave, we were assigned a harried but competent waitress (who was tipped well for catching up for us). No obvious manager around, and certainly not the type that would pitch in and clean the messed-up bathroom or pick up paper or other droppings on the floor near us.Anyway, the whole premise of a wood-fired oven seems like false advertising, because it looks like there's a gas flame burning in the back of that oven, with a small pile of wood thrown on the side to dress it up. And the results are not really up to what one expects from this style of preparation. The crust is not as thin and lightly prepared as classic neopolitan, and of the two pizzas we ordered, one was decently charred, the other pale an unfinished. That was the margherita, which can be excused for its drab tomatoes for this region and season, but the cheese should have been closer to a fresh buffala style rather than low moisture and stretchy/chewy.The appetizers were fine, really enjoyed the hummus and crust \"chips\", and the caesar salad was also fine. But overall this is not the wood-fired pizza destination I wish it would be. Sure, we can't expect a Pizzeria Bianco in this sized town, but something as good as Settebello Pizzeria Napoletana (Henderson NV) should be possible. So far, the best option is actually the Dragonfire pizza truck, but they also have some issues with not quite \"getting it\". But they do have a really good crust going, and you can't go wrong with their basic pepperoni pizza.",

This is a shared parking lot with Moe's.... it's kind of like that parking lot up at the Starbucks on Prospect.... small and narrow.... so you have two fairly middle-of-the-road chain restaurants sharing a one lane parking row.   I'm already off to a bad experience here.   As you walk in, it is actually very nice.... lots of seating and a clear view of the wood-burning oven.  The menu is fairly large --- lots of choices for all types of palettes -- salads, appetizers, pastas and pizzas.   The waitresses are friendly and they were hamming it up with my five-year old son, who was supplied with crayons and a little booklet.   He loves pineapple on his pizza so he put in the order for a Hawaiian pizza and I ordered a greek-like salad.     The waitress brought water and my first sip, there was a little piece of clear plastic floating in it... yuck.  Don't know what that was about but it seemed harmless.  The food came about 10 minutes later and the salad was huge.... with a huge chunk of bread.   I ate about half of it and took the rest home.   The pizza came out --- it was about 10 inches, cut into six slices.   The crust was thin and foldable....which I like, but it was fairly tasteless.... there wasn't any tomato sauce on it, and am not sure if the description said it was a sauce-less pie or not... but my son didn't seem to mind it.... he was just happy about having pineapple and ham (or prosciutto to be more specific) on his pizza!   My real gripe about this pizza was the amount of cheese.... it was so much.   It was gooey and melty which was a good thing, but there was this layer of grease sitting on top of the pie which was off-putting and made it very salty....We easily finished it because we were pretty hungry and frankly, it isn't that much better than Papa John's or Jet's.... just lighter (in terms of crust and texture) but just the same amount of greasiness.   I would choose this place over Monical's...but it still ranks in the low-mid range of pizza places in town.    My top 5 list is still:  Dragon Fire, Antica Pizza, Pizza M, Jet's and Papa Del's.   I still haven't tried Azzip so that's why it's not on the list..... the bottom 3 of my list are in no particular order, it just depends on what style of pizza I want.",

                "review": "Our small family tried Brixx tonight. We love wood-fire brick-oven pizza. Two of us had the pizza and one of us tried the meatball sub with black bean salad. We also tried the Korean bbq meatball appetizer, and I had a Brixx house salad as a side. Neither pizza lover gave Brixx pizza top marks. The crust was not especially crispy. The blackening on the bottom lent a bitter flavor. To the good, the ingredients were high quality. I loved the pear-gorgonzola topping with walnuts and carmelized onions, although the onions were sauteed at best and not at all carmelized (they were out of the butternut squash-goat cheese pizza, so this was my second pick). The more traditional cheese pizza was just passable. The Korean bbq meatball appetizer did not taste Korean (and I'm a Korean food lover), and came with pineapples chopped up as a garnish -- it didn't go with the flavor profile of the meatballs, but it didn't fight against it either. The meatballs were tender and tasty in a generic way. The side salad was good, too, with goat cheese and pistachios. It hadn't been seasoned and the dressing wasn't balanced (too little acid in the vinaigrette). The meatball sub could not be held, and that's a pet peeve of ours. If you can't pick it up, it's not a sandwich. The toppings were somewhat off-putting in terms of texture, but the meatballs were good, with Italian seasoning. The bean salad side received a 7.2 out of 10. Good but not great.The music was on too loud and the tables were not well cleared or cleaned. Our waitress was the only one on duty when we arrived and the place was filling up, but there seemed to be a lot of other staff. She was good and friendly, but overtaxed. The place has double sets of doors, but the inside doors were open. Hard to know why. Restaurant staff should be aware that this lets in flies, and sure enough, it did.We didn't feel cheated, but we probably won't be back.",

We both ordered water and a pizza. I got the artichoke hearts veggie option and my husband got the Caribbean jerk pizza. We then sat there unattended until a different server brought out our pizzas. I asked him to bring our drinks and he apologized and got them. The pizzas looked good visually when delivered but there was a lot of crust as I ate and my toppings were not evenly spread. Two of the pieces literally had no artichoke on them. My husband said his was not much better. The sauce on the Caribbean jerk pizza was not evenly spread so not every bite was flavorful. The crust was not good by itself so we both had a pile of crust at the end. We did not see our server again, but the waiter that delivered our food and drinks stopped to see if we needed anything else. I asked for the check and he asked who our server was. I told him I did not know. The server then reappeared and the checks aid his name was Sam G. We paid and left. Truly disappointed in the food and service.",

The price was right. I got the lunch special, 1/2 pizza and 1/2 salad, which is available Monday-Friday between 11am-3pm for $7.95. Great value. I had the mediterranean salad and rustica pizza. Both were outstanding! Definitely recommend. Some reviewers seem to be complaining that there wasn't any sauce on the pizza.. Read the menu before you order. If there is a hollow yellow circle next to the item, the crust is brushed with olive oil. If there is a red filled in circle, the crust has traditional red pizza sauce. The manager was very visible and friendly. My only complaint, and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is where we were seated. The place was virtually empty, but we were seated in a booth right next to the entrance. The restaurant phone kept ringing quite loudly directly behind me. Something to keep in mind for those in charge.",

I had the rustica pizza without olives, which was tasty. Pretty generous on the toppings but I do think the mushrooms were underdone and they appeared almost raw to the eye. I also thought the whole cloves of garlic were a little excessive even though I love garlic. The Bronx bomber pizza was pretty good as well and again, generous with toppings. They have a really wide variety of different pizzas so pretty much anyone can find something they like. Aside from the food, our server was extremely friendly and helpful. Overall a good experience, don't know if I would make an effort to go back, but it's definitely not a bad choice if you're in the mood for pizza.",

Their Left Hand Stout is also excellent. A local micro brew also supplies great offerings. Champaign has some great pizza offerings. Brixx thin crust brick oven pizza is unique.

Out of all those times Sam has been out server at least 3. He was honest, helpful, friendly, fast and just all around a great server. One time we went and the kitchen was having a struggle bus day. They messed up both our pizzas! Mine was remade once and still they forgot the goat cheese. My husbands was remade 4 TIMES And still wasn't right... We ordered menus items with no customization, so I think the kitchen was just having a bad day. They were very nice about it and so where we. The manager was there that day, but we didn't talk to him. I have tried almost all the meat free options and all are amazing! My husband loves the 4x4, which is sauce free, but surprisingly good. They make the mozzarella in house and it's so good!!! The beer selection is pretty good too. We trie the root beer on tap too. I would highly recommend that!

The kids menu was very good, and my kiddos just love their pizza and pasta at Brixx. What is more, they will give each kid a ball of dough that they can shape to their pleasing and they will throw it in the oven, and out comes their own creation! Great idea!I have not found Brixx to be overwhelmingly busy. The ambience is outstanding!The only thing I might grade them down on was that getting to their parking wasn't easy, given construction.

Azzip pizza is basically identical for 1/2 the price.I will go back, but they have work to do.",

Either that or I was starving - probably the latter. The server was a bit pushy and had an attitude. After we ate, we played a few rounds of pool. At this point I probably would've gave this place 3 stars but it's what happened at the end of the night that completely turned my night sour. As we were leaving, a staff member came and started screaming bloody murder at us. I was stunned and asked my friends what was going on. From how she was acting you would've thought someone had gotten killed. Turns out my friend forgot to pay for pool. She was out her damn mind yelling at us like she was crazy! The way this woman acted was completely rude and unprofessional. There are numerous ways she could've dealt with this situation and the way she chose was completely and utterly unacceptable. Honestly don't know how this place is still in business. Wish I could give this place 0 stars. Yeah, it's THAT bad. I will NOT be coming back!!",

We ordered the Hawaiian although we substituted BBQ sauce for regular pizza tomato sauce.There are fun pool tables and other arcade games. A jukebox for your favorite tunes can be found near the bar, i think.This place seems to be a staple of downtown champaign.",

So my main complaint about the lunch dining experience is sanitation. I ordered the burger the first time and a hot dog the second. I guess some people don't mind having a communal condiments station but I have a problem with this. The fresh produce like pickles, onions, and lettuce are not refrigerated at all at the communal condiments station. I mean at least puts some cold ice under the box of pickles, lettuce, and onions at least! The ketchup bottle and mustard container all looked like it was ready for the dump. The tips were hardened and crustified and it just looked out of date because no one bothered to keep em clean. Stickyness galore. Wash your hands if you still decide to go. Anyway, minus food but fun joint. Proceed with caution cuz after a few beers you might just make a drunk order of food and realize you got yourself into a bigger mess then you had planned.",

On more than one occasion this man acts as if we are in his way rather than welcoming us as guests. Last time we were there he was in a particularly bad mood, being nasty to his fellow workers and acting as if the patrons were in his way. I come to a bar to have a relaxed fun evening, Rich has more than once made the evening very uncomfortable.I have been in the bar when Rich wasn't working, and when he is not there the people behind the bar are relaxed, they smile, and seem to have fun, but when Rich is there everyone is on edge and grumpy. God forbid anyone does anything in his \"territory\", they get a nasty look. This man is more worried about making sure that everything behind the bar is in its place and perfect, than he is about giving good service to his customers, he will walk by an empty glass many times without asking if you need another drink, you have to flag him down.I think he has been there much too long, and has lost the knowledge that the customer comes first.",

Plus, the deals! 18 Asian dumplings for around 5-6 dollars? Delicious black bean burger for about 5 bucks? Gin and tonic (my standard drink) for less than 4 bucks? What is not to love?Add in the great service, the nice sized televisions for sporting events, pool tables that I am dying to try, and quiet music so we can actually talk to each other and hear ourselves think, and I'm still kicking myself for only checking this place out now. Plus free peanuts! I LOVE FREE PEANUTS. Now, granted, this was a rather quiet Thursday, so we'll have to see what happens if/when it gets busy. But so far, all systems go.",

Even though I have not lived in Chamaign for about 10 years, I can still find people I know, and bartenders that remember me.When I was little I would order kiddy cocktails from the bar, then get change to play on the only pinball machine.  Then stomp on all the peanut shells on the floor.  I have seen expansion many times.  Originally from one bar and a few booths, to a wrap around bar, then finally to the pool hall and extra bar area that you see now.  I have met U of I basketball coaches here, there are pictures of former Cubs players kissing my Mom (wait, what).  My parents originally met here.  It is safe to say my family has a mullti generational history here.Anyway, beyond the nostalgia, it is one of the best pubs to visit in the downtown area.  Just a great place to relax and have a few drinks.  Along with the evolution of the bar, so has the menu.  Now there is a mix of pub grub like burgers, fish sandwiches, etc.  Which I don't think are that great.  Though the various pizzas are very good.  As are the wings, which I am not typically a fan of.  Though these are baked, not fried and battered like most.  The Asian Dumplings are great as well.  The service can be hit or miss.  Depending on the time you come, and where you order.  Bar service is pretty good, but the waitresses can be a bit confused when trying to find you after you place the order.  Though they work hard, and always take care of anything that might be wrong.Drinks are pretty standard.  There are a handful of good micros on tap.  Usually something from Two Brothers or Dark Horse as the main micros available on tap.  A bit more extensive selection in bottles.  The rest is typical drinks for a neighborhood bar.Overall, not perfect.  Though the goods far out way the bad.  An institution in the downtown Champaign area, and a place I will always love.",

They're just shots of pineapple infused tequila and even my friends who hate tequila seem to love them.I also really like this bar because they have some good bar food (lots of fried stuff) and they serve fried food pretty late. This place is also big, so it can feel busy without being shoulder-to-shoulder like some bars. It's just an all around nice place for a chill night or a party with a big group. Probably one of my favorite bars in Champaign. Just make sure you have your ID because they WILL card you!UPDATE: The jukebox is now gone. I am not happy.",

I would not put Esquire on that list.The decor is uninteresting at best. There is no personality. It's designed to appeal to a crowd that just wants a nice bright place to hang out and drink.Not being a drinker, I can't rate the Esquire on that, but I can rate them on the food, and the food is so forgettable, I forgot to review it. Our group had a couple of burgers, some wings, and a chicken sandwich. I was told the burgers were good. The chicken must be avoided at all costs.The sandwich is one of those strange creations that takes chicken strips and puts them on a bun. I'm not entirely sure why, as this makes an awkward eating experience. The strips were nearly tasteless. Thank goodness for mayonaise. My wife had the wings. After one or two, she was trying to figure out why they didn't seem right. I was going to eat them, but I couldn't, and I LOVE wings. These things had enough salt to turn Lake Michigan into a salt lake. They were awful.  I would not go back at all. I'll eat diner food, fast food, and other kinds of food, but not Esquire Food. Meh.",

It's a great place to watch sports games and the prices are quite reasonable for the amount of food they serve.

It was a Saturday night, when the bar is super crowded.  We were a group of 4, and as always finding parking spots on downtown Champaign can be a such a chore in weekends. Anyway, you order your food to the bartenders. Waiting for the bartender to notice you in a crowded bar could be ok if you want to order a beer or shot, but for food? I don't like the idea. I ordered a Greek Pizza, while the aforementioned friend ordered a garden pizza (I can't remember the name now, but it was their vegetarian pizza) . To be honest, I dodn't like either of them. The Greek one was a disaster. It had clusters of feta cheese spread over a thin crust, and almost nothing else. It was supposed to have sausage, but I couldn't taste any. The vegetarian one, although being the better one, was kind of juicy. A juicy pizza is NOT my favorite. I'm not against non-American-style thin crust pizzas. As a matter of fact, I love Jupiter's pizzas. But these ones, well, you heard me. There should be a reason these were so cheap (I guess around $7), and I now know it.",

This place is right across the street from the station. I sat by myself at the bar, but there were plenty of others riding solo as well. It was THAT kind of place - where the locals can come and drown away their sorrows. Actually, it was much more than that - this place seems to have a little bit of everything. There are pool tables in the back, so you can get that sort of crowd. There are larger tables as well, so you can see some large groups of students gabbing away. There are a good amount of TV's, so there were some people watching the evening college football games. There are decent sized booths, so I saw a couple people typing away on laptops. And there's a jukebox, so some people are silently rocking out to the classics. And perhaps best of all, there were plenty of townies around for some great people watching. At one point of the locals who had clearly had too much to drink began serenading a nearby booth with the Canadian National Anthem. Although he didn't get the words right, I gave him an A+ for effort. The bartenders called the guy a cab and made sure he got home okay. It felt like I was inside some sort of insider club where everybody is friends, and even the students are cool with the townies.The beer selection was surprisingly good. There were a lot of good import options available, although I stuck with $2.25 Bud Light drafts. Remember, I was taking the Amtrak home, so that shows you how much money I wanted to spend.... They have $1.50 PBR drafts too, which is what the locals stuck to. The food was pretty good as well. I had a simple cheeseburger and fries. Although not my favorite burger/fries combo, it was definitely worth the $4.50 I paid. The \"fixin's table\" they have is nothing more than onions, pickles, and tomatoes next to some condiments and sauces - Nothing special there. But there was something cool about being able to put that stuff on yourself, I guess.The charm of this place lies in the characters that visit, and for that alone, I am giving a 5 star rating. The cheap food and beer is an added bonus. And I almost forgot, free peanuts! If I return to Champaign any time soon, I will definitely be back to this place.",

The main problem is that it doesn't have great beer.  It is pretty townie and older for the most part, which is actually kind of nice coming from the Pig or M+Ms, and it does have a decent unpretentious neighborhood vibe (despite not being in a neighborhood).  They do have pineapple infused tequila they make themselves, which is delicious, so make sure to order a contusion.It's a fairly versatile place, good for happy hours.",

Cheap drinks, good service, pool, and TVs everywhere; what more could you ask for?!I love the peanuts thing they do, and I love the whole feel of throwing the shells on the floor! I feel like a rebel for making a mess, hehe. Their fries are wonderful to chow down on when you're feeling pretty happy, and their honey mustard is ridiculously good (not sure what kind they use, but I need that in my life!). I was a little disappointed they didn't have Bulleit bourbon, but it could just be a southern thing. I got over it quickly, Makers is a good substitution in my Old Fashioneds. Two thumbs up for Esquire! Will definitely be back next time I'm visiting Champaign",

I ordered the portabella mushroom sandwich (super bland), my sister got the chicken salad (she said it was pretty good), and my mom ordered the salmon.Overall the food was nothing special to me however coming from the city to this little suburb area the price for the food was pretty amazing. The salmon only cost $7 and it was a fairly big portion. The servers were nice but the atmosphere was too load. I wont be back here but that mostly has to do with the lack of food options.",

Esquire has grown and changed (a bit) over the years to accomodate the changes in downtown Champaign, but it still retains much of its original character.  I think it and the Brass Rail are the only two places left where you can really hang with the hardcore downtown alcoholics.  I mean HARDCORE!  Esquire is awesome!",

Its journeyman efforts will win friends and a few high fives, but it is not the flashy varsity letterman. Food here is just fine, and very reasonably priced. I have been disappointed with the size of their appetizers once or twice, but their entrees are a solid value, cooked dependably to be exactly what you expect in pub grub. Prices are very good for downtown Champaign, but they lack the booze selection of a Radio Maria or Blind Pig. The gross looking jar on the bar is infused vodka.Service is always friendly, and fastest at the bar. If you sit at their pretty awesome outside tables, the trade off is that you're gonna get ignored. You can order lunch ahead and pick up 15 minutes later. The free peanuts are priceless, as are the friendly patrons who are more likely than other crowds in town to strike up a convo with you. All this sounds pretty complimentary, but the fact is that this place is not stand-out awesome in any particular way. If you want to take your friends from Chicago to visit 4 places in downtown Champaign that are all different from each other, to give them an idea of what the \"new\" Champaign has to offer, you aren't going to stop at Esquire. Of course, that's just fine with me. I'll at the end of the bar eating peanuts and saying to some dude I just met holy shit the White Sox sure are Cubbing it hard this September.",

It somehow manages to straddle the line in such a way that nobody really seems to feel out of place there.  The burgers are some of the best in Champaign.  They have a good char-grilled taste to them that so many other, more pretentious, places lack.  There are a large number of sides to select from, including fried mushrooms, onion rings, french fries, potato chips (which, sadly, just come from a bag), fried broccoli, and Asian dumplings (which my friends tell me are fantastic).  I've had the polish sausage once, and it was passable, but nothing special.  The pizza is good and comes in a number of varieties.The one complaint I have is that the service can be especially hit-and-miss.  There have been times I've been served wonderfully, and there have been times I've been ignored for a half-hour just to refill my drink.Overall, Esquire is a down-to-earth place with good prices and good food.",

I have traveled from Coast to Coast - my dad loved tasking me to a place in chicago and spending upwards of 80.00 on what is known as Chicago's Famous Pizza ... Can't touch Esquire Lounge Pizza --- Too Bad I don't drink... So (5) Star!   When I walked in the female bar attendant ingnored me TOTALY - Then a kind gentleman from the back came over drying his hands - all smiles and was California Kind! Sorry I did't tip him... But the female waitress had me SHOCKED! This is 2015 -  THIS PLACE WILL SEE ME AS OFTEN AS I WANT A SNACK! LOL! HAPPY !",

The place is dirt cheap and the food is simple and good. 1.50 pints of old style and 3 dollar grilled cheese sandwiches make this place my cheap go to in Champaign. They also have free peanuts which are good when you are too cheap to buy the cheap food, like I am sometimes. It's a bit of an old man bar but the cheapness makes up for it in my mind. Also, they have a number of large pool tables. The place can be pretty packed on a Fri or Sat night as well so it makes for a good time.",

Otherwise, the spirits and beer selections are okay. It's about on par with the rest of the downtown bars (similar to Jupiters, for instance). The pool space is nice and open as well. I'm not a huge fan of the aesthetic (my inner OCD hates the peanut shell on the floor schtick) but it's a pretty good bar.The food, on the other hand, has been consistently underwhelming. I haven't tried the pizza yet, but that's because I've been unimpressed by the other stuff I have tried. The appetizers tend to be greasy, and the chicken fingers were weak. Plus food normally takes forever to come out of the oven.In short, come for the booze, but eat beforehand.",

It's also the place I had my first legal drink, the place I arranged my first (extremely underwhelming) one-night stand, the place I had my first post-breakup talk ... the list goes on and on. In short, the Esquire is a place of firsts for me, and for that reason it holds an unimpeachable place in my heart.It's a good place, even taking none of the above into account. The prices are reasonable, the service is friendly, the drinks are stiff, the food is tasty, the jukebox kicks much ass (except on one night a few years back when some doucherocket fed about a million dollars into the machine and played Pogues records all night, but I am willing to let bygones be bygones). There's a nice array of seating options: small tables, mid-size tables, large booths, and the bar itself, which is the best place to sit if you want super-fast service and a good vantage point for eavesdropping and people-watching. There are also some tables outside, which are nice places to park your ass if you're a smoker or like keeping an eye on the goings-on along Walnut. The outdoors is heated during chilly weather, and although it doesn't too a ton of good in the dead of winter, it's lovely on brisk autumn nights.The people who frequent this place are an interesting mix. Some townies, some students, some regulars, some noobs. You're just as likely to see a gaggle of hipsters looking vaguely out of place as you are to see a group of middle-aged business types in dad jeans. Every once in a while some truly fresh and interesting personalities will be present, such as a trio of cackling cougars sipping pineapple margaritas and flirting with any male under the age of 26, or two sharply-dressed men having a snappy but ultimately friendly conversation you ache to be a part of, or a crusty old man with a walrus mustache who will pound your table with a hammy fist and yell something that sounds friendly but is completely unintelligible. Oh, and every once in a while Tim Lash of Hum fame will be hanging around, which I think we can all agree is pretty delightful. (I do not advocate drunkenly pestering him, of course, but if you do want to say hi be assured that he's about the nicest dude on earth and will receive your attention with much grace and warmth.)One of the best, most endearing things about this bar is its all-around friendliness. I often go here by myself in the evening with whatever book I'm currently reading, fold myself into a corner, and order a few beers. Not once has any patron or staff member given me grief over this, and for that I am truly grateful. Yes, the linoleum is hideous and yes, the bathrooms are a little iffy, but all the bartenders remember my name, and that's something that can't be beat.",

You could say I grew up throwing peanut shells on the floor and stomping on them. (For the record, I still throw the shells on the floor, but I no longer do the accompanying dance--that stopped being cute around age eight.) Before my family moved away from Champaign, this was the number one place we would take out of town relatives visiting. Even as objectively yummier, cooler places opened up around town, Aunt So-and-so and Uncle Whatshisface would always demand to be taken back to Esquire, and we were always happy to oblige. It's a comfortable, unpretentious bar, and that's what you needs sometimes.It's all about the ambiance, really. There are better burgers in town, but at Esquire it's the whole package that keeps me coming back. That and those peanuts. For real.",

She had been to Esquire before and said the burgers were good.  I really like the place.  I had the chicken tender sandwich with fries, and it was FABULOUS.  Everything a fried chicken finger sandwich could be.  At first it was delivered to the table empty, just a bun and chicken fingers.  But then I was told of the \"Fixin's Table\" where I got to add my own lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, and a sauce(s) of my choosing. I enjoyed sitting outside and watching the people walk by.  And when my other friend showed up with her dogs, they didn't mind at all.  And she loved that they had Fat Tire on tap.Overall, I would definitely recommend this place.  The only problem with sitting outside is that you do not get to throw your peanut shells on the floor- you have to bring a bowl outside for the shells... ah well...  On those cold winter nights I can throw my shells on the floor inside.",

It can be quiet enough to have lots of talking with friends, loud enough to chill by yourself and have some food.One drawback is it's hard to find seating on weekends, but with two rooms and two bars, it just takes a bit of time but not too long, and that happens with any bar in downtown on the weekend.",

We were also looking for something with a \"college\" feel considering its a college town and we are about 10 years out of college. Nostalgia gets me every time. This place had a much older crowd (on a Monday)...think 45 year old regulars, but what do you expect on a Monday night? The draft beer selection was ok. They have one Bell's, Guiness and Harp on tap, but that's as \"crafty\" as it gets at the front bar (the back bar was closed and may have had more available). The food was only OK. We got a small personal pizza and a steak sandwich. Neither one was that great. The staff was super friendly and GREAT with the kids. The price was also right.",

When we got to the coffee shop, it was inexplicably closed. So as we sadly walked back to our desks, we pondered \"where can we get a black bean burger from?\" He mentioned \"doesn't guido's have them\" and I'm like \"yeah\". But we also wanted to get the fried mushrooms, and sadly, guido's doesn't have fried mushrooms. On a happy note, they have eggplant fries. So, we drive to downtown Champaign. Walk into Guidos. I  attempt to sit at the bar (as I'm bar folk) but he doesn't prefer that (he gets plumbers crack sometimes and doesn't like to sit in exposed back chairs... tmi?) So we grab a booth. Immediately a server comes to take our drink order, mountain dew for me, diet for him. Drinks arrived momentarily. She asks if we need some time to look at the menu. As we knew what we were in for, we said \"nope\". Both ordered the black bean burger, his with fries, mine a side of the eggplant fries and toppings on the side. I go to do outside things. I come inside, sit down, we chat about office things. Food arrives shortly thereafter.Black bean burger is as good as a black bean burger can be (and that's pretty good). Eggplant fries are both eggplant and fried. He tries one, as he's never heard of such a thing, he becomes a fan. She refills his diet. Food is done, she asks if we are ready to pay, we say yes. She drops the checks. She comes back a minute later when we've pulled out our cards. She runs them. She brings it back. We sign. We go.It's about as perfect a blackbean burger and eggplant fries lunch as you could ask for.  I managed to not go play the devil boxes.",

If you have a fancy drink request or want a specialty cocktail, perhaps you shouldn't go to a sports bar in a college town.That said, I've never been here late at night, and I could completely see this as begin a place that would have a vibe I'd hate at that time (again - college town, people, know what you're getting into), but coming here on a weekend during the day or right after work is nice, especially if you want to watch some games.",

Totally friendly and personable, she took good care of us [wish I could remember her name!]. The five of us were catching up and she seemed to have perfect timing for when to come by for drink refills/seeing how we're doing.I ended up with the Western burger and eggplant fries [thanks be to Yelp]. Totally in love with the entire meal. I'd never had an eggplant fry before and would come back just for a basket of those suckers. Definitely a cool place in an area that seems to be getting fairly hip.",

I have to say that the waitress was extremely nice and very apologetic about the wait, but it was seriously ridiculous.  It's probably a good place to go if you've had a couple drinks already, aren't in ANY hurry and just want bar food.

                "review": "Over the course of a week, there comes a time in a college student's life when the dining hall food is not an option and cooking a meal requires too much effort. On this particular Thursday, that is exactly what my roommate and I were going through. We typically go for our favorite restaurants (usually the ones within a short drive), however, we tasked ourselves with trying new restaurants in the Champaign-Urbana area this semester. And that is how we ended up at Guido's Bar & Grill. Menu: Big font for the name and smaller font for food description; Subtle colors of maroon, black, goldish yellow, brownI am the type of person that usually is able to find something right away no matter what the menu offers. However, this time was difficult because the menu did not have as much as I expected. I was in the mood for a sandwich and decided to get the Buffalo Chicken. This consisted chicken breasts battered and deep fried, spicy sauce, melted Swiss cheese, ranch or bleu cheese dressing (I chose bleu cheese)! I honestly only chose this option because it came with all toppings and a choice of a side item. Might as well get the most out of my money, right? For my side choice, I chose my favorite of tater tots. Restaurant: Spacious room with the bar in the center and surrounded with multiple booths with low lighting. My roommate and I decided on takeout and were surprised at the amount of people in the restaurant who were studying and networking. When we walked in, we simply walked to the bar and were asked if we ordered takeout. When we said yes, the bartender simply gave us our receipts and then our food with minimal taste. Food: This is where it gets real. Nothing is more terrifying than a hungry college student and unfortunately, Guido's did not meet the mark to satisfy my needs. The food was not as tasty as I expected and it might have been to the combination of the spice as well as the condiments. Also, on a sad note, the sandwich lacked the bleu cheese, which may have aided in the taste. For some reason, the blend of all the ingredients actually made the food quite bland. On a plus note, the tater tots were the perfect combination of crunch on the outside and softness on the inside. Overall, I do not think that I would return for any of the entrees at this restaurant. Yet, I do think that that their sides would be a great snack on a late night of studying!",

I think their food is fine, I've taken my dad there before and we've definitely had worse meals in CU over the years.  Hell-- I even think that some of their martinis are better than those at Boltini-- blasphemy, right?  The bartenders have always been very nice, but I had one interaction with a waitress that was less than ideal-- I ordered La Fin du Monde, she brought me Lindeman's Framboise, I pointed out the error (they're polar opposites of the bottled alcohol spectrum, I didn't want to pay $8 for raspberry stuff) and she made a comment about how it's not like they could give it to someone else.. trend in DT champaign? But, she did bring me the right beer after I questioned her initial decision.  Overall, I like going there to play pool on the quiet nights... on the weekends, I'd rather go somewhere else.",

Typical greasy food, but the western burger was just really good.Surprisingly though the eggplant fries were amazingly delicious!. This was my first time trying eggplant fries, so good my friends and I had to get a second order! I would go here again, the prices aren't bad and the service could have been better, but when you're with people who make you laugh, it overshadows that. Go & try it out, even if it is just for the eggplant fries!",

Even more egregious than her dress was her lack of awareness and concern for our dining experience. We waited for more than 45 minutes for our food, even though there were few customers at the restaurant. We had to acquire our own silverware and our own napkins. She did not ask once if we enjoyed our meal or if we needed anything else. It's very disappointing that so many restaurants fail due to the cancerous threat of poor service.",

I still go along, but my heels drag on the way there, and my feet get itchy after half a beer.There are a million places just like Guido's on the North Side of Chicago, and I think that a high proportion of the patrons here represent next year's crop of Chads and LP Trixies. Guido's isn't 100% a Campustown bar, but its on the way. Teej T.'s observation re: the crowd is 100% accurate, and unfortunately asshats like this are more the rule than the exception. Food is pretty decent, prices a little on the high side for pub grub, but a good value for lunch. The place gets pretty crowded on Thurs-Sat nites, and the service gets understandably slow then. Good, but stingily-portioned onion ring sides. I say if you're gonna upcharge me for onion rings, I want a lot of 'em.Objectively, the place is 'fine' in a ho-hum way. Subjectively, the intangible anti-culture, anti-intellectualism, anti-anything that is novel, interesting, and unique in favor of everything that is popular, faux-hawked, slutty, and top-40 brings this place down a peg.",

The grilled chicken I got was really juicy and tasty - not the dry, flavorless, just out of the freezer stuff you'd usually find at other bars, and the nachos and quesadillas are yummy, cheesy, goodness.It's clean, spacious, great ambiance, and they have an outdoor patio for additional seating.

Their southwestern quesadilla with the cajun chicken is amazing. I don't usually like things with corn, roasted or no, but the whole thing is delicious and not laden with grease. The grilled tortilla is flavorful, as is the side cup of southwestern sour cream they give you to dip each bite in. Other good eats are their onion rings, Cobb salad (and it's under $9--cheap by my book), and Buffalo chicken. Bottom line, I dig Guido's.",

Clean, fairly spacious and a cool atmosphere. We looked over the menus and started with quesadillas. The menu is pretty basic, most of your standard bar food, plus a few salads and a few other options. Nothing too crazy, but we really weren't looking for anything too different tonight so it was all good.The quesadillas were pretty tasty. The cheese was melty and the corn and other contents were tasty as well. Not 5 minutes after our quesedillas came, so did our sandwiches. I ordered the (only available on Friday) beer battered cod sandwich and she got a buffalo chicken sandwich. Mine was pretty tasty. Very messy to eat but I think anything beer-battered is pretty good. The fish was a decent portion, too. I got tater tots for my side and these were pretty standard, as most tater tots are. She said she liked her buffalo chicken sandwich, and that's all I can say for that.Our server was nice, but the entire experience seemed a little rushed. We got our sandwiches a bit too quickly after our appetizer came out. I wasn't even 75% done with my sandwich when we were asked if we wanted anything else, and when we said no she asked if we wanted the check. I'm not the fastest eater, but the whole sit down experience couldn't have been longer than 20 minutes, it was a little too rushed especially since there wasn't really anyone waiting to be seated.My other qualm was the price. Our entire meal, 2 sandwiches and 1 appetizer, without drinks, came out to nearly $28. After tip, we were at nearly $35, for bar food, with just water as our drinks. I just think this was way too expensive for what it was. At nearly $20/person there are definitely better options in the area. I also remember the one time I came here last semester, the drinks were pretty expensive too.Overall, it was expensive for what it was, I felt a little rushed, but the food wasn't bad.",

You would think paying $8 for a bacon burger, they would put more than 2 skimpy slices of bacon on it.  The fries were good though.  They were the super skinny ones, sort of like Murphy's.  I did not check out their beer selection, not because it was a business meeting, but I had serious studying to do after wards, so I can't comment on that aspect.  I can see it being a good place for groups to go.  Not sure what the night crowd is like.  It's maybe a little fancy, but not required.  Like, if you wanted to \"go out\" and \"dress up\" you could probably go here, but if you were in jeans and a t-shirt that would be okay too.  Know what I mean?The waitress was nice, it has a large, open area, I think a pool table, and booths and tables along the perimeter.  And outdoor seating.",

Nachos were out of this world. My wife had a Guido grilled cheese that was suggested and she loved it. The six year old had one of the best burgers I have ever had. Our next trip to ChampBana will include this place just to try an adult milkshake. Thank you for doing things the right way!",

There's a handful of appetizers, a few salads, and the rest is sandwiches and burgers. Nothing on the menu really stands out as being that special. I got the Reuben sandwich and it was fine. The bonus was the eggplant fries, they were pretty good. There's a decent beer selection (mostly in bottles, with some on tap). With its apparent shortcomings I plan on going back. This is the kind of place I could see myself hanging out at and having a few beers before moving on to other places for the night.",

Most of the fun, for me, is people watching. There are lots of locals, and they are all hilarious. My favorite experience was learning video poker from three kindly gentlemen.

They have six taps, and 5 have some variety of mass produced light lager with one serving guinness. They do have more variety in bottles. The past couple of weekends, they've had fat tire and sierra nevada pale ale in bottles but that's probably going to be the most variety you'll find there.",

I got deep fried mushrooms instead of fries which were cooked very well but kind of small.  The \"bloody gary\" was excellent but expensive for just one cause it had alot of ice in the glass.  Its called a bloody gary because its garys recipe.  The drink has beef broth in it which gives it a different taste.  Overall i enjoyed the meal but kind of expensive.  They need to clean up the outdoor eating area by remodeling some things but nice to have an area that big.",

Hidden off of Main Street, it has a collection of regulars on the bar stools drinking beer, but I would not hesitate to bring a child or senior citizen in for a sandwich.  One TV is likely to have a Cubs game playing and the other TV might have CNN.

Just sitting in those chairs, pulling the lever, over and over and over again...Quite the people watching place if you ask me which I love.The drinks are cheap here, they have a big outdoor patio and BBQ they use in the warmer months which seems fun, and it is definitely a laid back atmosphere where clearly no one really cares about anything. A mix of different types of people, and granted we were there on a weekday night on one of the coldest nights of winter, and this place still had people in it, so that should say something about this charm of a dive bar for sure!",

The inside was nicer than I expected for a tavern, so that was a pleasant surprise. Lots of locals inside, I think we were the only students there. They have slot machines which I elected to try and lost $3.They have a decent selection of bottled beer, but only a few common ones on tap, Guinness included so I was happy to be able to get one of those.The bartender seemed nice, although I don't think he knew how to properly pour a Guinness. Not a big deal.I didn't feel that Bunny's was by any means inexpensive though, at least for me. Both of my beers were $4.50, my friends Jim Beam and coke was $3.50. The campus bars are probably cheaper though if you're really just looking to save $.Overall an A-OK experience, I'd come back again and would like to try the food.",

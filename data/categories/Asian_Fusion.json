After fifty visits here, I have never seen either one in an apparent bad mood. They're just happy people, and happy people make great food.FYI: Whilst observing the magic behind the curtain one day, I did see them cooking the vegetables by blanching them in a deep fat fryer along with the egg rolls. -- And that's why Chinese food tastes good, folks!",

The owners are extremely nice and accommodating and best of all, the food is very inexpensive. Every time family comes into town or I have friends over, we make our way to cravings for a great meal. You order at the counter and they call your number when you food is ready and all you do is go and pick it up yourself. No fuss dining. There is also free water, hot tea and plastic utensils in the front - server yourself.Here are some dishes I love:-spicy fried chili chicken: fried chicken pieces that are stir fried with scallions, spicy chili and sweet yellow onions (spicy and delicious! - all time fav!)-salt an pepper squid: fried strips of squid stir fried with green peppers and onions (crispy and irresistible)-masala fish: battered fish stir fried with masala spice and veggies-eggplant with ground pork: the eggplant is soft and tender, which is well balanced with the rice ground pork-pork belly-clams with black bean sauce-mapo tofuThe staff is super friendly and have great recommendations if you're not sure what to get. Overall, great food! This place gets packed pretty quickly so make sure you snag a table!",

The line is usually long, it's crowded, and the huge menu is scattered in about 5 different places, making it a little weird the first time you go. But you will be back. I don't know what they put in their food here, but everything is just really, really tasty. It's not going to win any culinary awards any time soon, but for the cheap price, you get a lot of downright delicious chinese food. I've probably been here at least a hundred times over my years on campus, so I'll try to keep this review condensed. Go to Cravings. Order the hot and spicy diced chicken. And never look back.",

They are spiced pretty heavily, so only order if you know you can handle it. Additionally I find their food a tad salty. for around 7 bucks a meal. Actually like many said the portions are enough for two meals. Cravings definitely has great value. Make sure to ask for more rice after you finish your first bowl, and pack it go to!I'll be back here many times.",

Additionally, it wasn't sweet, and there were a lot of onions in the dish.  A lot!The ingredients (rice, beef and onions) were fine, but I can't eat something that has been sitting around for awhile and isn't fresh and hot.I'll try this place again because the owner is a nice guy, but my first experience wasn't a good one.",

Like many of the people writing 5 star reviews, I was impressed by the large menu, the frequently cheerful staff, and the mostly reasonable prices.  But as I went to other Chinese places in town, my opinion began to change.  I noticed that most of the dishes at Cravings were really heavy and oily.  And that most of the specials were very similar to one another.  And that some of the menu options .. didn't really match what was being described.  I don't mind some innovation, and I know you can't really get a Japanese style bowl of Ramen anywhere in Champaign, but Cravings' offering is nowhere close.The last three times I went I ended up throwing out my leftovers.  I absolutely hate wasting food, but I couldn't finish them.  One was a squid special; the squid was extremely chewy and seemed overcooked.  The plate was mostly green peppers in a salty sauce, in any case.  Another was a \"coconut shrimp\" plate.  This translated to fried shrimp with (very sweet) uncooked coconut milk simply poured over them.  Unhealthy and not even tasty.  The last was Gado Gado Fish, which I remembered getting and enjoying in the past.  It was still really heavy - lots of breading with an oily, thick sauce.  If you want to spend a little more money, I highly recommend Golden Harbor instead.  But the food is much better.If you want to spend about the same or just a little more, I'd check out Lai Lai Wok instead - which I think is overrated, too, but is a bit better than Cravings.  Or you could get take-out from Rainbow Garden, which is pretty solid.  If you want to spend less, you could try out Empire or Bo Bo China.  (Bo Bo China is all you can eat if you really want to maximize your calories/dollar.)",

Sure, it's not the swankiest of places, but if that bothers you so much take your food to go!First of all, the guy running the place is so cool. I told him I wasn't feeling well and wanted some soup. He was like, I have JUST the thing. Not long after, I picked up a huge bowl of soup with big ol' chunks of fish cakes, squid and shrimp. It was a hot and sour seafood soup with noodles, and it was nice and spicy. At most places, when they talk about spicy food, it's not really that hot. Not so at Cravings. I am used to eating spicy food and I was wiping my nose.Gross, I know.Anyway, the ingredients taste fresh and the portions are huge. They provide water and tea for free, which is great when it's cold outside. And they give great takeout containers for soups. I know, it's the little things. I'll definitely be back to try more on the extensive menu. Hm, I wonder if they deliver...",

It must have been a seriously high concentration because I've never had this bad of a reaction to MSG in food before. I was feeling so sick that I threw the rest of the food away and went home. I woke up later in the middle of the night with intense head pain and stomach pain, got about 3 hours of sleep.If you value your stomach, and mental health please don't go here!",

My favorites are the General Tso's Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Jakarta Fried Rice, and the Hot and Spicy chicken. The food is delicious. The prices are great. You always get more than enough meat and a side of rice. That said, the place is kind of sketchy. There are rumors that it was closed for a few days in Spring 2013 due to health violations. And I'll admit, I have seen a bug or two crawl around right on the menu. But with the delicious, greasy food that comes out of here, I'm willing to eat a couple bugs. Definitely worth it. Pro Tip: Call in your order for pick up and start walking there. By the time you get there, your order will be ready to go and all you have to do is pay. Boom.",

The flavors are amazing here and the service is amazing, the food comes out quickly.  It's feel-good, home-away-from-home cooking.  It's no wonder there's always a lot of international students and a few home-grown midwesterners eating here - they've discovered one of the best spots for Asian food in Champaign.  (And the engineering quad is also right across the street!)It's not a fancy place.  You'll clean your own plates when you're finished and when you order, you'll be given a number which they will call out from the counter.  You can grab your own silverware, napkins and cups of water/tea from the big kettles near the cash register and clear your own dishes when you're finished.  But what they lack in pomp and panache they make up for with good food and cheerful service.  Simple as that.If I had to choose to order one thing consistenlty, it would be their crispy tofu.  Hefty wedges of soft tofu are lightly breaded and fried.  It's served topped with strings of fresh green onion and this incredible thick garlic dipping sauce, which I would eat with plain rice.  It's that good!  And it's my favorite.The Indonesian Fried Rice comes with a fried egg on top and their MaPo Tofu comes spicy (chilis bring it on), in a very sharable portion.  Our dishes also came with the soup of the day, something along the lines of egg drop soup with tomotoes.  Here you will get an affordable meal with amazing Taiwanese-Indonesian-Chinese flavors.When i was a student here, I would mostly order take-out and the portions would last me at least two meals.  Come here if you want a filling, hearty meal that will nourish your heart and soul.  Dining in is great to eat family style since the dishes are shareable.  If you come consistently enough, I think you'll find your favorite dish that you'll want to order every time.  The owners are incredible people who take great pride in their restaurant.  They know they are a beloved spot on campus and treat their patrons in the same way.",

I had this like everyday last spring); -mapo tofu (really good, spicy, and only 6.50 for a very generous portion); -gado gado chicken (nutty and sweet);-masala fish (crispy and spicy fish fillet); -beef pan fried chow fun (stir-fried beef with large noodle, really good);-Sizzling chicken pot (I have to stress it. it's SIZZLING chicken cooked with basil and onion);-Pepper and Salt Squid (apparently everything starts with \"Pepper and Salt ___\" is really good. Try pepper and salt fish also).Some more Chinese dishes that I like:-black mush room & tofu w/ groundpork;-basil pork with rice;-bean noodles with ground pork (a lot of people asked me what I had when I ordered this dish);-hot & sour seafood noodle soup (tom yum based, with LOTS of seafood, perfectly for a cold day);(these 4 dishes above can be found on the white board near the counter).The Mongolian beef is good but it's not consistent. I like it to be a bit overcooked, but sometimes it's still a little rare to my liking, especially during peak hours.These dishes are all from the Chinese menu since i'm not a big fan of Americanized dishes in general.",

Only knock on this place the food is a little oily and I wouldn't consider it healthy eating haha. But when the food is this good who cares!Long Story Short: There have been several times where I was bashing my head at the computer lab working on an engineering project and just said \"Screw this, I'm going to Cravings\". Nothing saved the day like food from Cravings. Shop Notes: Pretty small shop and gets packed pretty quickly around lunch and dinner. Service is very quick and efficient, take out is always a good option. Very reasonably priced with pretty large portions.Sentence Summary: Is the food entirely healthy? Not really. Is it delicious and authentic? Absolutely.",

It almost seems like you're part of the family when you come in. There's free tea and water to drink while you wait for your food which is also awesome. While the building is big with lots of seating, due to the popularity it can get crowded, especially after classes get out in the evening.

I wish I had more time to decide, but we were in a hurry.  The menu was much larger than I was expecting, divided into different regions, and I would love to come back and try something else.Total, including tax, came to around $13, which is pretty good for the amount of food I got.  Even though I was warned to be ready for a wait, and it was the dinner rush, we got out in probably about 15 minutes.  My udon ended up being good, if a bit plain.  The crab rangoon was good, and I wish I had more of it, but it was not spectacular.  I was told the fried rice was very good, though a bit on the salty side.  Looking at the other reviews, I suspect I will have to give this place another try and order something different.  Maybe it will blow me away next time.",

Unfortunately, the summer hours aren't updated on Yelp and the place was closed early on Sunday night. Oh well, Monday night, I returned and boy, was I glad I did.This place is about as dive as you can get. But we all know, good Chinese restaurants are all about the food...so I dove into the menu. I was happy to see they had a \"Chinese\" menu for the real authentic dishes. I ordered the mushroom and tofu curry. It came with a small bowl of seaweed soup and rice. Extra rice was free (which is always should be!) as was the hot tea and ice cold water. The curry and the soup were both delicious.I returned the next time to try their famous hot and spicy chicken. WOW! The servings are enormous. There is a reason why this is the most popular dish...it was amazing.Cravings is a must try for Asian food lovers. I highly recommend it.",

It's a very lively place and I really like the owner - he's fluent in multiple languages and is overall a pretty cool guy. The food is really cheap and you get a lot for what you pay. One nuisance is the long lines and crowds because they're so popular, but they have a good ticket system to make sure you get your order.My favorite item is the Jakarta fried rice! I've also ordered the wonton noodles in miso soup which have lasted me for lunch, dinner, and impromptu midnight snack. Their menu is really diverse and offers home-made meals from China, India, Indonesia, and many more Asian countries. If you're from outside of the U.S. and missing home, a meal here will soothe your aching heart like chicken lo mein for the soul.",

I'm from Los Angeles, where we claim Monterrey Park and Alhambra as the official China Town of America, at least cuisine-wise, but I find that Cravings beats out most of the places I've eaten at out here.During the year I spent living in Urbana, I frequented Cravings almost every week, and during that time I have tasted almost half the items on the menu.Most students coming grab a lunch-sized dish for $5 or $6, but ordering the $8 or $9 full dishes pays off if you plan to be out studying all day. You get so much food that you can easily take half of it with you to go, so you can finish it later while studying at the library or wherever.Menu highlights include the Mongolian Beef, the Marsala Fish (careful, very spicy!), the spicy crunch chicken, or if you want healthy, the seaweed seafood dishes.If you're just a beginner, you might want to just stick with the Mongolian Beef, General Tso's chicken, or Kung Pao just to experience how they do the classics so well and full of flavor, then move on to other items in subsequent visits.My biggest regret in leaving Urbana is being able to taste the food that this wonderful Malaysian family has brought to corn-field country!",

I went in during the lunch hour, and it was jammed, mostly with Asian students and staff. The owner was very friendly, and even with a packed house he offered me complimentary Chinese or chrysanthemum tea. My test of a good Chinese restaurant is to first order some Americanized dish, and if they make that well, then the authentic dishes have to be good. I ordered sesame chicken to go. The aroma driving back to the office told me something good was in the styrofoam container. I opened it, and there was the delicious smell of toasted sesame. The flavor was quite nice, but the dish was ruined by too heavy a coating of cornstarch and overcooking.Most of the pieces were very dry and hard to chew. I'll go there again, but next time it will be noodle soup or fried tofu.",

Good Chinese food is awesome; bad Chinese food is one of the nastiest things on earth. So I rarely go to a new Chinese place without someone telling me that it's worth trying.A couple of my husband's co-workers (who were very in-the-know about Chinese food) told him that Cravings was one of the best in town. We tried it, and it became one of our mainstays. We usually order the crispy beef, which is lightly breaded and fried (I think) and then tossed in this incredible sweet-spicy sauce. One order is enough for both of us, and unlike other places that do not use the best part of the cow when they are breading and frying it and tossing it in a delicious sauce, the beef is usually really good--not tough and stringy and fatty and gross.The man who owns Cravings is very nice, and I'm always happy to see crowds eating there. They seem to have authentic dishes along with the Americanized stuff, so if you want a steamed whole fish, you can get one here. I would try other things, but I am too addicted to the crispy beef to move on.",

For their Chinese food, they have separate English and Chinese menus (with American Chinese food on one, and real Chinese food on the other).The girl at the counter was very enthusiastic about explaining the menu to us. She made several recommendations and she knew everything that was in every dish on the menu. Totally different from most Chinese restaurants.*Update: The food was great. My tofu in the stir fry tofu with black fungus could've been crisper, but the seasoning was perfect. The whole dinner portion comes with unlimited rice, unlimited side soup, and hot tea for under $8! I will definitely be back again to try other things on the menu.",

They have a very extensive menu with something for everyone, they have lunch specials for even cheaper chow, and the owner is very friendly (yay for discounts, especially if you go often).  I would recommend any of their noodle or rice dishes (I frequently go with Ma Po Tofu or anything with chicken ^^) and they cater all people from those on special diets, vegetarians, Americanized Chinese food (think orange chicken), to the more traditional dishes.You can take-out as with most Chinese restaurants, but I've always sat down with friends when I eat here.

The options are pretty limited for vegetarians, but I loved the cheap price and large portions(unlimited rice!) as well as the complimentary hot tea. The ma po tofu is the classic vegetarian option that everyone orders here, but in my opinion, the real gem is the tofu in chili oil sauce. The ma po tofu was certainly good, but it was not spicy enough for me, and wasn't layered enough in various flavors. The tofu in chili oil sauce on the other hand, has the classic bite of the Sichuan peppercorn, and is actually spicy, with the varied flavor profile I look for in spicy dishes. Overall, it's definitely my favorite Chinese restaurant on campus.",

Try the chili chicken and the eggplant.",

Unfortunately they do not deliver and I don't even think they know how to use a phone. The last time I was there the man was so busy he picked up the phone and put them on hold and never picked it back up. I found it funny, but I'm sure that customer did not. And, you know, if they opt out of delivery they should really clean the place up a bit. I get worried what the kitchen looks like and have peeked back there a few times to see complete chaos (mostly because there's 8 or 9 women cooking for too many customers to handle). I love the food, but this place is great to go to maybe a few times per semester. It's just too crowded for my liking.",

My roommates and I decided to order from Cravings after realizing the Golden Harbor might be too expensive. This was probably a bad decision as we had moved from probably middle tier Chinese to low tier Chinese food in terms of price and quality.The General Tso's chicken was just OK, I've had better and it honestly more resembled orange chicken in both taste and looks.Others got a beef dish and a seafood combination which was on the Chinese menu. I had no clue many of these restaurants have Chinese menus that are often more authentic and probably better quality and tasting than the regular menus. I need to order off those menus and not the Americanized ones for future reference.The fried rice was pretty bland as well. Eggrolls not very good, either.They forgot to include a side order of crab Rangoon and when we called back they said next time we are in the Rangoon will be free. I wasn't impressed with the food but in all fairness it was like $6.50 for a large portion so at least I wasn't hungry afterwards.I still want to try some of the other Chinese places in Champaign as well as ordering off the non-Americanized menus. I think the cuisine is interesting but the quality just hasn't been there at the last couple places I've tried.",

The more American orange/General Tso's/sweet and sour/etc. chicken dishes are $5.25. The owner guy behind the counter most of the time is one of the friendliest restaurant workers I have ever met. Tips:-They make Chinese food the best. If you're unsure of what to get, your best bet is to get something Chinese instead of Japanese/Thai/etc. -Be sure to look at the white board on the floor to the left of the counter! -Explore the Chinese menu sitting on the counter (it has English translations) These are some of my favorites: Basil pork egg rice, Jakarta fried rice, Pork with preserved vegetables, Crispy beef, Fried fish fillets with bok choy, Beef stew eggplant pot, Spicy fried chicken, Mapo tofu, Sizzling chicken pot.",

Speaking of casual the music is very weird - distractingly so.Honestly, it is too expensive for what it is.  I had the tempura ($10) and it was more deep fried than tempura.  The $ sushi sampler was okay, but will get worn very fast (a little like the champaign $ sushi that gets boring after a while) and the sushi roll was more mayo than fish for $14.All in all not worth the time or price.",

It's conveniently located right next to an apartment complex on campus and its employees are composed of college students. The whole environment exudes a very simple and clean style. The food is quite fantastic. The stir fry is superb and the sushi is delicious. Its major fault is that it's definitely too expensive. The specialty rolls go from $13-$15 for 8 rolls and the rolls are smaller than other sushi places. However, they have a unique \"create your own sushi\" menu item for $9 for 8 rolls. This place would be perfect if the main entrees were $2 cheaper.",

I think with the lack or marketing it was confusing when the new spot opened but it was the express version. This place has a completely different feel from the one downtown which is fine. I like that it's quick and I don't feel weird eating alone between classes because everyone else is doing the same. Sushi was good. Nothing amazing I only got cooked seafood so I can't say on freshness of the fish. However their set up for cooking is going to lose them money. I ordered three BIG roll pieces and I watched him pull them out from under a heat lamp. Obviously they have to make the whole roll and not waste money but I don't want to see that process.  Not the chefs fault just the layout.  Maybe once it's consistently busy that won't happen as much but definitely takes away from the idea of fresh sushi. But I still ate it and it didn't taste dried out so I can't really complain. It's a clear your own plates place or its implied with the dirty bins out next to the trash which I hate but whatever everyone does it. This is a quick place for sushi and I think the pros out weight the cons. If you want a more sit down experience go downtown.",

The popularity of the $1 sushi day has led to two locations, with this one being on campus. I actually prefer this location to the other one. It doesn't have outdoor seating like the Neil St. location but it's always extremely clean, the staff is very courteous and helpful, and it is just the right temperature for dining (I don't why some restaurants insist on being -4F). The sushi is very Americanized so expect a lot of cream cheese, beef, and other more accepted ingredients. I've had a lot of $1 sushi in the past so I tried the chicken stir fry with udon noodles. It was good, piping hot and came with a good broth. There wasn't any particular seasoning or teriyaki flavoring. The meal was about $10. Overall, a good experience for a quick lunch for less than $10.",

The $0.80/piece Hooked deal was the perfect excuse to get take-out on a weekday!It's really clean on the inside and the dcor was spot on for a quick-service campus place like this.I decided to get one of everything and doubled up on a couple that I thought sounded good to fulfill the 10 piece limit on the Hooked deal. It was hard to tell which one was which on my plate, so I'll just say that I know for sure the Big, Popper, and Coconut stuck out the most to me. I felt the Cali was a bit lacking/plain and in general the rolls labeled \"spicy\" on the menu had little to no kick to them. I couldn't seem to pick up the jalapeno in any of the pieces either, maybe it was accidently omitted?The people behind the counter are more than likely students and were very pleasant.I would say that it does seem to be a little overpriced due to the pieces being considerably smaller than the rolls I'm used to, both in physical size and the amount of fish versus rice.Do not get me wrong though, it is definitely a good option with the Hooked discounts, and would be a relaxing atmosphere to bring a virgin sushi friend to try it for the first time, since they could just order the sample pieces.I will for sure give the house rolls and other entrees a try since Ko Fusion is in a great location.",

The menu isn't as big as the one downtown BUT if you ask (and they have the resources) they will make you pretty much anything from the downtown menu. Still have a wide variety of things on their smaller menu and a great on-the-go sushi option for students on campus. This is my fave sushi place on campus :)",

It was, hands down, the best restaurant experience I have ever had in Champaign-Urbana. First off, the atmosphere is an easy 10/10. The inside of the restaurant is absolutely gorgeous and and top-notch. The service was also amazing. Our waitress was super friendly, answered any questions we had regarding the menu, and checked in with us enough to ensure that we were doing okay and had our refills. It did not feel like she was checking in on us because it was her job; she really made us feel like she enjoyed making sure we were enjoying our meal. Even the general manager stopped at our table to see how we were doing. The food itself was also quite impressive. For such an expensive restaurant, we were expecting small portions, but all of our dishes were huge and had gorgeous presentation. Most importantly, the food was delicious. At some point during our visit, we informed the waitress that it was my roommate's birthday and she was more than happy to take photos for us. The icing on the cake was that she brought my roommate a birthday card signed by the staff as we prepared to leave the restaurant. Miga exceeded every single expectation I had for the night. Not only did my roommate enjoy his birthday dinner, but every one of us who attended enjoyed the experience and we all had a great time. I highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a higher end place to do dinner and drinks. This place can hold its own with the best in Chicago. I can't wait to go back again.",

When my companion and I arrived, we were seated and waited about 5 minutes for the server. When the server visited the table for the first time, I told him I would need some assistance with the menu as I had a gluten allergy. The server, a bit hostilely, told me that the the chef and the restaurant would not serve anyone with celiac disease and if I had a problem with that he would have the manager come speak with me. I let him know that I had made my allergy clearly known on the reservation request and that I was unclear why the restaurant had not notified me. My companion and I left, feeling angry and embarrassed. We walked past the hostess station where he was conferring with the hostess and manager. None of them spoke to us as we walked through the door. There is nothing on Miga's website to indicate this limitation. If there were, I would not have chosen to dine there.",

It's creamy and a little spicy..it's good when u start eating it but I feel oily when I have the third,fourth bite...so I didn't finish it. My cousin ordered salmon bibimbap..it was a big plate but the food in the container is very small...I have to mention the rice..as my cousin told the waitress the rice is so little that she can't even feel full..then waitress give her extra rice and it turn out to a little rice in a pudding sized bowl...so......lol...",

An open dinning area with a long bar towards the back. I really like the set up, with old black and white movies projected on one of the walls...this night it was Rebecca, the 1940's film noir with Laurence Olivier.  My Mom could have narrated the entire movie for everyone if the restaurant would let her :)This is Asian/Korean fusion from the people that brought you Sakanaya.  They are true locals within the Chambana community.  The menu here is a bit more streamlined, unique, and at times more pricy.  While certain things you scratch your head at, like a scallop appetizer with only one scallop, though you cannot help but be in aw of how enjoyable it is.  Which comes with amazingly tender and flavorful pork belly as well.  Then there is the Wasabi Caesar Salad, which my thought is they just put a Caesar Salad on the menu just because.  Then you realize that everything is so well integrated and amazing.  The oven dried cherry tomatoes, the great salty anchovies, and the spicy wasabi salad dressing.  It all works perfectly.  The dumplings are really good as well, even though I did not find anything particularly special about them, They were very enjoyable.The mains included the Soy Cream Chicken Pasta, which my Mom and Dad both swear by.  Then my Miga Bold Noodle Pasta, which is amazeballs.  A spicy stir fry with bell peppers, bonito flakes, and chili pepper mixed with other veggies, chicken, and shrimp.  Yeah, this made me sweat a little, in the best way.  There is shaved salmon on top, which is so hot the flakes literally vibrate, a really unique presentation (don't ask me to explain, just get it and enjoy). The noodles are incredibly tasty by the way. Both dishes are around $15, and they are more than enough to make your stomach pop.  They have more expensive entrees, which may or may not be worth the cost.  It is hard to tell which appetizers are worth the price.  Some, like the scallops are not worth it (though very tasty) others like the salads can feed an army.  With the dumplings being in the middle, which is well made and what you would expect for a starter.  Drinks are enjoyable as well.  Some well made cocktails, with a Migroni that is what you would expect for this spin and on point.  Also plenty of wine, and even a well thought out beer selection in bottles.  La Fin Du Monde pairs perfectly with any spicy dish they put out.Service was impeccable.  The waiter new the menu, with recommendations, and was Johnny on the spot with any needs.  Overall, this is a really well thought out restaurant, everything is fresh a tasty with the right amount innovation along with traditional tastes thrown in for good measure.  While not 100% perfect, another really good option in downtown Champaign.",

                "review": "I went with a group of friends for a birthday dinner. The birthday girl wanted to try out this new place. One friend was a bit reserved because she had previously tried to dine here and left because no one came to their table for a long time. So we didn't know what to expect this time.When you walk into the restaurant, it is absolutely beautiful. The ambiance is wonderful (candles, low lighting, modern). The tables were all preset with place mats, silverware, and with centerpieces (oil burners). The menu is simple. Starters, main dishes, sides. Drink menu is extensive. Everyone ordered cocktails/beer. We enjoyed them all. The drinks were strong.We had a variety of starters: Mandu (potstickers with a reduction), chasu bun, sea scallop (came with slices of pork belly). The starters were on point. My sea scallop melted in my mouth and the pork belly was a nice chaser. Then our meals came out: Bi Bim Bap, MIGA noodles, Salmon dishes...The portions for some of my friends looked small while others looks overwhelming (bi bim bap comes in a huge wooden bowl). My noodles were too spicy. We asked if the spice could be toned down but we were informed that the sauce was made in the morning and it could not be reduced. My lips were on fire and were numb the rest of the evening before dessert.There isn't a dessert menu, but our server shared with us a list from off the top of his head: Apple Pie with a Sour Cream Ice Cream and Miso sauce (amazing), Red bean Mochi Ice Cream, and Expresso Mochi Ice Cream. All of the desserts were great.Everyone enjoyed their meal (taste-wise). I liked my dish, but it was too spicy for me. If you get a starter, a drink and a main entree..it all adds up. One of my friends didn't get a starter and she still paid $50 (food and drink). I had a drink entree, and got one of each dessert to share and ended up paying $54 (included gratuity). So it just depends on what you get.Parties of 6+ have an automatic 18% gratuity...fyi. Overall, I liked my experience. Will I be going back? Not sure. Maybe for a special occasion. For me, it's a once every 6-8 months kind of place...",

Though I still have to say I prefer Sakanaya, which I believe is owned by the same folks.Right off the bat, the environment is great. You don't feel like you're in downtown Champaign. Everything is very modern and trendy. The dishes and glassware look beautiful and when I've been there, they had old black and white movies playing. The only downfall here is that some awful music (Michael Bolton, really?!) was playing.The prices are decent I guess, they're a little on the high end, especially for the portions that you get. But I think overall, the flavor was great. We've sampled the scallops, dumplings, filet, and noodles before and I thought everything was delicious. I will say though that the mochi was very pricy for how much you got, especially after being spoiled in Hawaii and going to bubbies and getting a piece for a couple of bucks if that.Another thing, I never once had an issue with service. I thought both times that I went there, we were treated wonderfully.Overall, the prices are a bit steep, but its refreshing to have this place downtown as an option and I will be going back.",

I would like to dispel that myth! Sure, it's a nice place and I wouldn't come here expecting a cheap meal but each of our entrees were under $20. I ordered the noodle bowl and it was about $15 which is only a couple dollars more than a pasta dish at Olive Garden. My co-worker ordered the bibimbop which was close to $20 but huge! In fact, both of our entrees could have been split amongst 3 people....each! So, if you want to save a few bucks, I highly recommend sharing! We ordered the bao buns as appetizers which were $4 a piece and VERY delicious. I was slightly disappointed to see that these weren't stuffed like traditional bao buns. They were more like sandwiches but I guess its fusion so they can get away with it. I will also say that while I really enjoyed the noodle dish, I could see why some folks might not like it. It was labelled with 3 pepper symbols so I was expecting spicy. But, instead of spicy, I would more accurately use the word peppery. It tasted heavily of black pepper. I LOVE the taste of black pepper but I also know that I tend to put way too much in my cooking so, I know that if I am made aware of the peppery taste, that there's a possibility that it's too peppery for most people.I will also add that I wish that they had lunch hours or at least were open for longer hours. I came by with my mom today and I noticed they have very limited hours and weren't open at the time. I feel like if they're only going to be open for dinner then they should have longer dinner hours available.",

The fries were delicious. Very crunchy as advertised, and the homemade ketchup was unique and tasty. The Parmesan wasn't really necessary though. The ceviche was delicious, really enjoyed that. Great variety of fish/seafood too. The chashu bun was also yummy, and one bun is definitely big enough to split in half. The Caesar salad was a tad overdressed, but the house salad dressing was very good. For my entree, I ordered the Kalbi ribeye steak. The steak was very tender and flavorful, all around a good piece of meat. There was a pile of very mild kimchi on top which was good, even though I'm not a huge kimchi fan. The rice pilaf that came with was also good. I tried the butter fish entree, which two people at my table ordered. One was slightly overcooked and one was perfect. Both were very tasty nonetheless, and thankfully butterfish is very forgiving and the overcooked-ness didn't completely ruin the dish. The scallops were good, although the portion was a little small and one scallop was on the rare side. After entrees, we decided to pass on dessert, though they sounded interesting. Only a few technical errors stopped this from being a solid 4 star meal, but it's a new restaurant and they should tighten things up in the future. Service was also extremely friendly. I definitely wouldn't hesitate to give them another try!",

Chashu Bun was also far below my expectation, at least that's not as the traditional Chinese bun as it should be. We all agreed that the dishes with beef would be the greatest, no matter the appetizer or the entree Bi Bim Bap with beef. Anyway I don't think it deserved the high price.",

We arrived around 9pm on a Saturday and there were plenty of diners and the atmosphere was nice. We decided to sit at the bar since we were only going to have some light food and a drink. We sat and sat and sat for about 15 minutes at the bar where staff was coming and going constantly before anyone said anything to us. After we were finally acknowledged the staff person was nice and gave us menus. Then our actual waitress came to take our orders and give recommendations.  I had a cocktail called It's Seoul Good. The cocktail was tasty similar to a cosmo with soju.  We decided to share the Migu noodles which was very pretty and flavorful but VERY spicy. Even my boyfriend who loves spicy food thought this was a bit over the top. Admittedly they mentioned it was spicy but this still seemed a bit on the extreme side and I'm no wimp.  We finished our meal and as we finished our drinks I pulled out a credit card to pay and then the waiting began again. Another 15 minutes before anyone said anything or came to give us the check while the waitress stood less than 5 feet away chatting up someone the entire time. It's one thing to be super busy and the service be slow but there was plenty of staff that just were totally ignoring us or so busy chatting up one customer they couldn't be bothered to check if we needed anything.  A quick bite that should have taken at most 45 minutes took closer to an hour and a half. The food and drink were ok but still fairly pedestrian. I may give this place one more try but I'm not itching to get back for anything we experienced.",

I had a chicken pasta with red pepper. It was well priced and tasted great. Our wine was well selected by our waiter and the bartender came over to check that we were happy. He had a very extensive knowledge of wine! Very impressive. After this good experience, I actually recommend Miga to friends and shared it on my Facebook.The second time, I wanted to alter my order a little because of a food allergies. I guess this pissed the chef off and he said some pretty nasty things to our waiter. The manager was rude and snobby to us. Everything turned out fine, but there was a lot of tension going around and it ruined the night. You could hear the anger coming from the kitchen. Management problems are going to kill this place. They had none of the same staff when I went back and I asked about the waiter I had before and was told he no longer worker there, same for the bar tender. Wow. Only open a few month and can't hold staff. I tried one more time. And won't be back. My food was cold, I waited forever for drinks and honestly, my steak was way over priced for what I got. Unless you order pasta, plan on leaving broke and hungry. I love food and this was far from impressive. Champaign/Urbana has a lot to offer for a foodie... Miga is not a good example. The manager and and owners need to figure  out how to run a restaurant like this and get a new chef. Otherwise... I think Miga will be short lived.",

The flavors for this mixed in really well (I would probably not opt in for the mixed greens). Everyone had gotten the Bi bim bap which was really nicely presented in a large wooden bowl with a side burner that had the salmon/steak. Heard no complaints there! I got the orange glazed salmon steak. It was interestingly presented. Colorful dish. It has a medium rare salmon steak, roast herb bacon, fingerling potato, orange mango reduction, citrus beurre blanc, preserved apricots and oven dried tomato. On to the taste...I realllly wanted to fall in love with the dish but it wasn't hitting the spot. The textures and flavors weren't really super memorable for me (it didn't make me go \"wow!\"). The salmon tasted pretty ordinary so I was hoping the sauces would make it pop some more. It didn't. I'm going to try other dishes but don't think I'd get this one again. I don't think the potato goes well with it. I'd probably introduce a grain that has more texture (farro/quinoa?/wheat berries?). Overall, I liked my experience here (I'd give it a 3.5..). The drinks are pretty strong...get the It's Seoul Good. I want to try some other dishes (maybe the Bi Bim Bap) and see if it changes my mind a bit more.",

I do not like sweet drinks and this one does a really good job of not being too harsh but not too sweet as well.  It is an amazing drink, but watch out it will catch up to you!  My husband loves the Old fashions there.  They are probably the best we've ever had.  We go in sometimes just to get a drink at the bar because we know it will be amazing.For our dinner, we definitely went all out.  We shared the wasabi Caesar and the scallop as an appetizer.  The salad was sooooo unique and delicious.  The scallop came with bacon foam on top and this amazing thick cut bacon around it.  Even though it was only 1 scallop it was enough to share between two people for an appetizer.  For dinner I had the beef bi bim bap and my husband the tuna.   The tuna was awesome though I've had just as good other places.  The bi bim bap was quite large and also delicious.  I am new the Korean food so I have nothing to compare it to but I absolutely loved it!  The beef was marinated well and very tender.  The bowl was full of so many flavors and I actually had to take some home it was so big.  We did end with dessert as well which was Korean ice cream.  Also very very yummy!   Overall our experience at Miga was the best dinner we've ever had in the CU area.  Today we had brunch.  The Bloody Mary was awesome.  I got the the wasabi Caesar salmon salad which was amazing and my husband got the chashu bun Benedict was very good as well.  It's not a cheap place, but definitely worth the money for a special occasion and more affordable but still just as delicious at brunch. Update: We went to brunch again yesterday for my dad's birthday.  My parents aren't as adventurous with food but we insisted they would enjoy it and they absolutely loved it.  I loved the new Christmas tree they put up and Christmas music they were playing.   It felt very festive and cool in there. My mom and I got the galbi burrito and it was amazing. Husband got the omelette bowl and it was great as well.  My dad loved the wasabi Caesar salad of course.  Yet another solid and memorable trip to Miga.  I will continue to support this place as often as we can afford!  Hoping it sticks around for a long time!",

Definitely a great spot for any special occasion.  The prices may seem a bit much for Champaign, but you get far more than your money's worth!  Even the mid-priced menu items (i.e., $15-18) are still large portions and more than enough for a full meal.  I had the rib-eye ($34) and it was cooked to perfection.  Miga also has a great drink menu to pair with whatever food you decide on.  I will definitely be back again!",

I personally love foods at Sakanaya and also I have heard many great things about this restaurant so I thought it would be worth to check out the restaurant.First of all, I would say this restaurant has a nice atmosphere. The host was nice and also the waitress. However, that is probably the only good thing I found at this restaurant.I don't know if it is about the restaurant only has one chef but it took about almost 30 mins for the food to come and there were only 3 other people sitting in when we were there. My friends and I thought it was quite a long time to wait for the foods to come.The foods really fell short for my expectation. I got the Galbi Rib-Eye Steak and my friend for the Sea Scallops for dinner. We both agree that the foods were too \"heavy\". The steak came with a small portion of kimchi fried rice that was cooked with butter which does not really compliment the taste of kimchi. I, too, prefer to substitute butter for oil in some dish but I found that using butter for kimchi fried rice just makes dish overall imbalanced. And there is also some fried kimchi on top of the steak which was very oily. I couldn't even eat pass two scoops of the fried rice and 1/3 of the steak because it felt so greasy after few bites. My friend's dish tastes a bit bland for our preference but too creamy. They added one piece of fried fat pork next to each scallop and make the dish tastes so \"heavy\" overall. Both of us couldn't finish our dinner because we feel so bloated from the greasiness.For the food's price we have to pay, I feel like the chef could have made the seasoning stronger and cut out on the fattening ingredients that were used in the dishes. But again, according to many people, I am a picky eater. I don't think I will come back to this restaurant again because I feel like gaining 10 lbs from eating the foods.....",

And then the food really really impressed me, especially for a place like Chambana... it was probably the best meal I've ever had in my 4 years at UIUC. I highly recommend Miga to anyone who wants a memorable, well serviced meal. It's honestly worth the price. We came around May 2015 because my boyfriend was treating me and my 2 roommates to celebrate our graduation and I really wish I hadn't waited so long to try this place! The next time I come back to visit campus, this is definitely on the top of my list to revisit. We made a reservation and even got a call a day earlier to remind/confirm. When we got there, something was wrong with our table (the party was being awfully rude and refused to leave) and our hostess was so extremely apologetic. For some reason she felt personally liable (when it wasn't her fault at all) and told us to order anything we wanted from the bar on her tab. So right off the bat, I fell in love with Miga's service. I got the $11 Hana (loved the strawberry and cucumber hints) and it was delicious, and my roommate's Green Tea Mojito was pretty unique as well. My bf got the $15 MIGA Old Fashioned (Bulleit rye, muddled cherry, orange, sugar cube, bitters) and it came with those cool sphere ice cubes.When our table was ready (it was only maybe a 20 min wait, our hostess seriously was being so overly accommodating and sweet... gah I really wish I remembered her name. Kelly?). We started with the $16 Beef SSAM (wrap-it-yourself korean style marinated beef that you wrap with lettuce, rice, this delicious sauce and kimchi salsa). It's super fun since it comes on top of a small grill and it's perfect size to share with a table of 4. I got the $18 Salmon Bibimbap and the serving was enormous. The salmon comes on another cute personal grill and the bibimbap rice & veggies (sauteed bean sprouts, pickled cucumber, carrots, perfectly cooked giant slices of shiitake mushroom, crisp lettuce, all topped with a perfect sunny side up egg) comes a very, very large wooden bowl. I barely finished 1/3 of it even though it was so delicious; all the flavors and textures complimented each other so well. The chilli pepper sauce is perfect; make sure to indulge in it (don't worry it's not too spicy)! My roommates shared a Bibimbap and they didn't even finish theirs either. The bae got the $28 Galbi Rib-Eye Steak on top of kimchi cabbage, and it came with this extremely tasty side dish of kimchi bacon pilaf kind of fried rice topped with cute micro greens.",

Galbi rib-eye looked good, in fact everything looked pleasing to the eye.  I just thought there was too much effort to add fried kimchi on the main entree.  The young chef needs to figure this out a little more.  Otherwise it is still a well run restaurant, young and hip, and I would definitely go back again.",

Some exposed concrete balanced by beautiful wood accents, high ceilings, birch wood decor, and black and white classics being projected onto the back wall. An open air patio that allows inside diners to feel that they're eating al fresco with no fear of sun or rain or the darkness of nightfall. Even the table settings are artistic, the knives standing on their blade and woven placemats inlaid with the table.I already knew Miga was beautifully designed, but I came to put their food and service to the test.The waitress was knowledgeable and attentive without being intrusive. She  navigated our table with expertise and the help of a second waiter, each explaining the details of each dish as they were delivered. I can't have alcohol so she offered to make one of their signature green tea mojitos virgin for me.We ordered the wasabi Caesar salad, house salad, and the sashimi salad, as well as the chasu buns and Mandu dumplings for starters. The salad greens are very delicate and light and taste fresh as anything, as if they were picked from the restaurants own rooftop garden. They're topped with beautiful edible flowers and Parmesan. The sashimi one is served with two pieces of tuna and two of salmon, both top quality. They had that certain je ne sais pas quoi flavor that is pleasant  but can't put your finger on. Chasu buns were delicious as well, with cucumber and a creamy sauce w the delicate pork inside. Mandu were very delicate yet crisp, a flavorful oil brushing but nothing greasy. Tender meat inside that was lightly seasoned and a dab of soy-balsamic reduction to go along with each one.I had the orange glazed salmon for a main course. I do recommend against having it medium rare as it's written on the menu. The waitress even attested to this, recommending it be cooked medium. I did this and actually probably would have gone for medium well/well done. It seems that they were going for a seared tuna effect/half cooked half sushi style but it doesn't work well with salmon in my opinion unless it's straight cold sushi. Nevertheless that didn't stop me from loving this dish. It's served with a trio of colorful sauces, which work best in my opinion when blended together on each bite of fish. The orange mango sauce didn't have a lot of flavor on its own bit worked particularly well with the citrus beurre blanc. The fish is served atop a small pillow of roasted fingerling potato over a bed of mashed potatoes, as well as a scattering of fresh vegetables around the plate. There are roasted apricots and oven dried tomatoes which accent the fish in an unexpected but delicious way. Finally there is a bit of crispy not at all chewy bacon which is the best bacon I've ever had. I give Miga 5 stars for impeccable service, a thoughtful and beautiful design concept from floor to ceiling to table, and creative, modern artistic food that doesn't sacrifice taste or portion for its visuals.",

                "review": "Today a group of 7 couples traveled to Miga's for Brunch to celebrate our August Anniversaries.  We wanted to visit because of the wonderful reviews we read about dinner.  The Sunday Brunch has only been available for less than a month and at first glance, the food choices might startle you, but don't let that stop you.  With a party of 14, we tried 6 of their 10 choices and there was not one person who was disappointed!  I ordered the most expensive item on the menu--the NY Strip Steak & eggs and it was prepared superbly.  It was cooked in sweet rice wine and topped with bacon kimchi cabbage and kimchi salsa with sunny side up eggs for $21 and I ate all of it.  It went well with the mimosa prepared with pineapple and my husband's was prepared with cranberry juice.  The presentation was excellent and this was a great choice for such a celebration.  My husband had the Lemon Chicken Salad as well as the Omelet Bowl and was able to devour them both and he is not a salad eater! The shaved Parmesan Cheese on top just added to the presentation.  Those in the party who ordered the Galbi Burrito could not say enough about it.  When you add to that the accommodating staff--especially our patient waiter, Jeremiah, this turned out to be the perfect choice for such a celebration.  We brought a cake to the restaurant on Saturday, along with some flowers, and they were very accommodating.  I felt that the prices were very reasonable for something so special.  One of the couples in our party is already planning on returning next Sunday to try something new!",

The size of the space is good, the waitress was really nice (automatically gave us the student price - which itself wasn't terrible for a sit-down restaurant), and it all seemed to go as it should at Flat Top.The concept itself isn't bad; when I was younger I thought Flat Top was the ultimate in food fabulousness. Now that I've been in college and made more than enough \"let me throw every thing I can find into a pan with some rice and soy sauce and call it stir fry\" meals, the excitement has worn a little thin. Of course, the vegetables are much more varied and fresh, the sauce selection is massive (just don't think about Sauceman's from Tom Goes to the Mayor), and they give you lots of special options that most college students probably wouldn't be able to do. Plus, you know, not having to cook or clean dishes yourself.I like the place, I'd recommend it to people for what it is, and I'd certainly go again myself. Also, I've heard good things about their breakfast...maybe next time?",

Mongolian BBQ blows theirs out of the water. I also didn't like that cooking the food wasn't the \"experience\" that it is at Mongolian BBQ.  One of the women I was with did find a hair in her food so she had to make another bowl which took a long time to do so.

We usually do the one trip because of time constraints.FT has a very nice selection of veggies and unique sauces.  The protein choices are regular, but fresh.  Yes, you pay a little extra if you want shrimp, and then they only give you a skewer... so stick with the chicken if you're cheap.What sets FT apart from the Mongolian-type places in Michigan is that you choose how you want your final dish to turn out - in a hot and sour soup, in a vegetable soup, on top of a salad, moo shu style, or just regular stir-fry in a bowl.  I've gotten the veggie soup my last couple of trips because I think the broth goes very well with the sauces I choose (spicy hot and savory, not sweet).  And their flat bread is amazing.

The waiter forgot to bring water/drinks to the table several times, after walking by and reassuring us that he'll be right back with water.  The waiter never came to check up on us throughout the meal to see if we needed anything, and we needed more water at several points.  As for my food the last time, it was not that great.  The sauce combo that i made was not good, and i should have had one of the servers mix my sauces (make your own sauces can really be hit or miss).  Finally, when we asked for our check, it took our waiter another 20 minutes to bring it, then another 10 to bring a carry-out box.  Overall, the stir fry is decent, but i would recommend having a server prepare your sauce mixture (whenever I prepare it, it never comes out quite right), and prepare yourself for not-so-great service because the servers are mostly college students who are working for mediocre tips.",

Then the price went up, you had to pay extra for shrimps, so I started going there less frequently. I went back there again today for a quick late lunch. Flat top lunch used to be a bargain for lunch take out at $7.50. I went there today and upon paying I got a bill for $8.99 even though on the board it says lunch price is $7.99 for students. I talked to one of the waitresses there and she's like that's just how it is, we just raised the price up EVEN THOUGH on the board it clearly says $7.99. I said that's a shady business practice, you can't charge someone extra for something that's not stated on the menu, and she said she can't do anything about it, and that i'll have to go talk to the manager. I talked to the manager, and he said the price just went up. Again, the board (which displays the menu and the price), says $7.99. Once he found out that I was getting a take out, he said oh the student discount is only for dine in. Again, this is not stated anywhere on the board or in the menu. I used to come here a lot, and I always got student discount with take out. I was not pleased with the tone of the manager and his sketchy business practice, so I just decided to dine in. A new, very nice waiter came by and apologized for everything. she was really nice and was sorry for how I was being treated. She got me the dine in plate and asked if I want to box it to take it home, and that's what I did. The extra $1 doesn't mean much. I gave that away as a tip to my amazing waitress. I'm just against shady business practices.And the food? the food is great. Service is usually good. I've dealt with the manager two times, and I felt like he's a rude and shady person.",

However they charged us all for the multiple-plate deal even though I didn't partake in it, which wasn't really too much damage (just a dollar more), and we all got student discounts despite half of us being young looking alumni.I think it all evened out.Breakfast was interesting.  Couple of guys had omelets, the girls all got pancakes (which prove useful since they could try the lunch after), and I got an egg scramble with loads of veggies, which counteracted all the beer and fat sandwich tasting the night before.  Right?  Unlike lunch, they set out a bunch of sweet stuff to go in the pancakes, like chocolate chips and nuts.  You also get fresh fruit with the meal for free.Protip I did not know: all the little sticks for extras come with what you pay.  I wish I had got some sausage.  Also, I barely got any hash browns.Lunch came around but I was stuffed.  We did discover some things: if you use the soup stick, you don't get a side of soup; they turn your ingredients into a soup.  Also, they have longganisa!  They call it Filipino sausage, which it is, but I was extremely excited to see some love for some of the best Asian food no one's tried.  It's leaner than the kind I usually have, which makes it a bit less authentic, but probably healthier.Overall, service was ok, but we didn't receive much instruction despite it being the first time for most of us.  My breakfast turned out all right, though I can't see if they did anything special besides scrambling my  ingredients with eggs and serving it to me.  The lunch seemed a lot more interesting with all the sauces and longganisa, though I think we did the right thing by trying both in one seating.We were also pretty hungover, so that helped.",

Depending on what the screw up is, you'll have to remake your entire bowl and wait a good 30 minutes, made even worse if you are dining with people whose orders turned out fine and will either have to wait for you or just go on ahead without you. They'll usually comp your meal to some degree, but it's still not really worth it. The inside of the restaurant is terribly laid out. Some space is completely unused, whereas the food bar area where you create your bowl is so cramped it's uncomfortable.

The difference is that they have tonnes of raw vegetables and ingredients to choose from. Oh, not to mention, weird sauces and food combinations. My combo was okay (it was brown rice, clams, beef, vege, salmon and roti prata) but if you don't have a sense of what goes with what, then your dinner is going to be a disaster. It's clever of them to have this pick-your-own-ingredients kinda concept because if the food was bad and you complained, they can point their fingers back at you and say that you chose the ingredients. Then again, you are not the only culprit. The grill sensei is responsible as well. If he over-grilled your food, it will taste just as bad no matter how wonderful your selections are. My friend's moo shu was not wrapped very well and some of the rolls fell apart. Well, there goes your dinner. I think it is good to try it once but more that once? You decide. Still, the combo of rice, salmon and roti prata bothers me. Maybe I am just a stuck-up purist who thinks that chickpea dhal is the only way to go. Could this be a one-hit wonder like Bar Louie?

Unlike a few places I've been, Flattop doesn't make you wait - the bowl is marked with your name and table so it comes to you when ready.

                "review": "I've been here twice for dinner, and they have a rather... conspicuous approach to business.First, the food is arranged so that the granularity increases. That is, the line moves so that you have to fill your bowl with foods of smaller granularity before you can get foods of larger granularity. Basically that means that you won't be able to fill your bowl with as much food. Think of packing a jar with sand first and then with golf balls versus golf balls first and then sand. Bottom line: the deal you think you're getting by going to a place that lets you pile on food, is not a deal at all. Dinner is ~$13.20 with a student discount. If you want a commensurate amount of food for what you pay, just go through the line backwards. Or go out the door. You can get plenty more food with that amount than you can at Flat Top. Example: 2 giant Chipotle burritos. Flat Top would make more sense if it were $10 or less per bowl. But it's not. Second, they got rid of their unlimited bowls option. I guess they realized it wasn't a good business model. So if you want more food, you can pay $4 on top of the price of a bowl for one more bowl.When businesses make their profit visions as visible as this, I feel a little cast away. I like it better when I can ignorantly throw money at things.Anyway, Flat Top is probably one of the best places to eat vegan on Green St. I have never before in my life seen so many vegan \"meats\" of so many different kinds. They have seitan, tempeh, quorn, vicken, and a lot more. Some of these meats are curry or bbq flavor. They also got that quinoa for some protein. They also make it super clear which food items are vegan; there's a giant blackboard behind the counter that let's you know. It's so cool that a Midwest chain put so much care into providing vegan options. I never thought I'd have to opportunity to try so many kinds of vegan meats in such a short amount of time.",

I think one of the issues is that you can possibly make something that doesn't taste very good; but that's the fun with experimenting. I'll have to say that the meat was fairly subpar. However, the rest of the food and service was fairly good. It costs $11 for lunch.",

We arrived at 7 pm and did not leave until 9 pm because of the slow service. I ordered a cinnamon roti for dessert referring to the cinnamon fresh fruit roti (the only roti item on the dessert menu) and I ended up receiving burnt roti bread with cinnamon and ice cream and no fruit. I then told the waitress that was not what I ordered but she did not take it back or give it to me for free. Overall, a restaurant that I've always had great experiences with really ruined a birthday dinner.",

                "review": "Flat Top holds a very very special place in my heart. Back when we were in high school, groups of us would wheedle and deal in order to secure a car, pack it full (ah, the days before there were limits on teenage drivers and their passengers), and drive it 20 minutes over to the newly opened Flat Top by Northwestern. We totally felt cool because a) we were on a college campus, b) this do-your-own-stir-fry was a total novelty, and c) it was fun coming up with new combos...that we had made up.Fast forward the years. Flat Top has apparently now opened a location steps away from UIUC. And it sucks. It sucks pretty bad. I hope it's an anomaly rather than a decline of the chain as a whole. Or maybe it's always been this way and I've never noticed??I decided on Flat Top for lunch because some of the other places I wanted to try were closed in preparation for the upcoming school year. And I seemed to remember that Flat Top was pretty quick. I was wrong.*Waited awhile to be greeted. It seemed to be short-staffed, which I kind of understand because it's summer, plus they opened 40 minutes earlier. But noon was in 20 minutes...is this how you usually roll?*The hostess couldn't decide where to seat me...a lone diner all by myself. She veered from the front where there were several groups. She was going to seat me at the high-tops, but given that there were several pairs there, veered from the empty ones. She then seated me...in a corner...all the way around the back. Uh, ok.*Seriously, if you don't know what you're going to put in your stir fry, back up a little instead of blocking the area with your nose pressed up against the glass guard and your head whipping back and forth reading the sauces. Or loiter in that extra empty space to make a decision. I understand you're here for orientation for your kid or something...but some of us have power lunches.*No employees at the stir-fry station with four or five already on the grill and four or five lined up to be placed on the grill. However, they do let you go thru the line again to make another dish while you're enjoying the first one to save time if you're doing the unlimited option. *Needless to say, it took forever to get my first dish...15 minutes. And then my second dish came two minutes after...which was brought by the original hostess who said confusedly, \"I thought you were dining alone?\"*The ingredients were AWFUL. They just opened for the day...but it was so obvious that the ingredients weren't fresh! The baby corn and bamboo shoots had a distinctly sour taste to them. Green peppers in my stir fry when I never put in green peppers. Vegan meat dry, rubbery, and tasteless. Even the beef had the sour taste of it standing around being marinated in its own sweat for hours. The squid was rubbery. And I think they use egg substitutes because that definitely did not taste like normal egg. I have to say that the tofu was okay though.*If you're sitting back to back in the booth chairs, they're pretty flimsy. The kid behind me kept shifting and I could feel every thump he made. It drove me nuts.So. The only reason why this place didn't get one star? Julia, my waitress. She was calm, efficient, and kept up a running conversation as she moved from table to table. She's quite the lady...knows a lot about obscure UIUC stuff and is super friendly to boot. Once she realized that I was on a schedule, she even offered me the check early so I didn't have to wait for her in case she got held up. Really awesome...thanks! $8.99 for a one bowl lunch, $9.99 for the unlimited option. If you're a student, you get a $1 discount.Thanks, Flat Top, for shattering a high school memory.",

You put all your ingredients in a bowl, add some sauce, and perhaps pick a custom option such as having your stir-fry as soup or in a peking pancake. The variety of sauces and options allow you to experiment with fusions- Indian, Thai, and Chinese options are available.  I had snowpeas, spinach, cilantro, carrots, pork, and a heap of spicy vindaloo sauce with an Indian roti pancake, which was delicious and filling. However, quality varies...sometimes the grill will overcook the food or mix it with someone else's (yuck!). Overpriced stirfry? Maybe...most of us could do better at home. When your dish is done they bring it to you. Service is good and you can also get drinks and appetizers if your stir-fry isn't enough. While it is a chain, it seems much fresher than nearby Noodles & Co. The major problems? Vegetarians get a bowl of what is essentially vegetables and sauce, which is not a good deal for the price. Crowds can also get horrendous, so make reservations for evenings and on weekends.I also recently tried breakfast here, which really wasn't worth the price. You can get french toast, omelets, pancakes, and scrambled eggs with add-in. There are also snacks like fruit and muffins for while you wait. My scrambled eggs were more like flattened eggs because of the amount of cheese they added and the french toast was a little boring. Not worth 8.99 unless you are willing to eat a lot.",

Of course, even if your stir fry comes out perfectly, I can't say you are going to get your money's worth unless you are hungry enough to finish a second helping for a mere $2 extra. However, even that has its caveats as if you choose to take home anything you don't finish, you'll have to pay $5 extra which will only promote wasting food in my opinion.Still, you may be allured by the freedom of handpicking your ingredients every once and a while, and it's a pretty fun place to go to with your friends.",

He had been eating unhealthily all day and we both knew that FTG was a place to both eat healthy and make yourself a large quantity of food for your money, if that's your sort of thing.We stopped in around 8:30 on a Saturday night.  There appeared to be only one server, one bartender and a manager on the floor. The manager appeared to be wearing many hats, seating, serving and bussing tables.Ok, most people are familiar with the process by now.  The food was good.  Our server Toni was good.  Honestly, the only reason I'm giving such a low rating is because the place looked like a disaster area.  It looked like a tour bus full of people had just left the place.  Dirty tables everywhere, trails of water and food debris all over the floor.  The bar area had 10 or so seats, with four of them covered by clipboards, paperwork, and other bar stuff.  While our server, the bartender and the manager are all trying to make some sense of the place, I head to the bathroom and the busboy is in the back of the room on his phone.The spot in the worst shape was the food line.  There were veggies all over the counter, sauces splattered all over, a few items were missing tongs, and there was only one guy on a full grill on a Saturday night.If you think about it, there's only one thing FTG offers, and that's the fresh food line.  If that looks unappealing, then the whole concept looks bad.  Someone with bad OCD that night would've probably had a Rain Man-style attack.For all the times I visit Champaign (once a year), I'll write off this visit.  I've been to FTG's that are immaculate, and ones that need some work.  This one could definitely use a hand.",

And this is a great place for students to go and enjoy time out with their friends given that they do have a student discount.",

There are discounts available for students that bring it down to the poor grad student budgetary range, and the option to take home a bowl makes it an even better deal.  If you're new to this restaurant though, be sure to either go with an experienced friend, or tell the wait staff you're new; there are a few insider tricks in preparing your food that you won't learn other wise.  One of the best is to always, ALWAYS, put the blue stick for bread in with your stir-fry.",

That deserves major props in my book!The only flaw in my dining experience? I felt a bit rushed to leave the restaurant during a late dinner hour.  While I personally would have ignored it and continued on with my conversation, my partner insisted that we leave to be considerate.  Not exactly how I wanted to end a dinner date...",

There is nothing fancy about this place but the fact that 'not many restaurants in champaign offer a similar concept, makes this place unique'. Its  a 'create your own stir fry' kinna place where you get to pick a combo of rice, noodles, veggies, meat, and numerous flavors of sauces/seasoning, which are all in turn cooked together. You also get to add naan/paratha/eggs etc. The paratha here is awesome, but also a bit too greasy (which is probably why it tastes so good). Although the downside of this concept is that, you can never get the same taste again. It lacks consistency. You might find the food delicious one day and unappetizing/insipid the other day. Whats more frustrating is that you cant even blame it on the cook :), because you picked the ingredients yourself. The chances that you might be disappointed by the food here are quite high when compared to restaurants where you know a particular item tastes good and tastes the same all the time. Cant really recommend an item here, cuz i really dunno how it might turn out for you.All said and done, this place is definitely worth a try (atleast once).Note: The staff is very friendly and provide excellent service.",

Yes, it is a chain that tries very hard to appear to be kitchy with hand-written signs etc., and yes, it is very easy to combine several ingredients that have no business being together making an unsurprisingly nasty-ass concoction. That being said the ambiance is pretty good: lively enough to have a good time, but still not too loud to hear your friends, with decor nice enough to justify the prices. I have always had good service.What I like most about this place is that it is such a crowd-pleaser. vegetarians, vegans, those with food allergies, gluten avoiders, Atkins dieters (idiots) and those who are just plain picky for no other reason will all find plenty that suits them.This place is not without its quirks, and if you are there for the first time, DO NOT lie when the server asks you if you have ever dined with them. Their systems are not perfectly intuitive at first glance, so let the staff lay some knowledge on you. But beware: like any buffet, they will try to upsell you on pricey cocktails, apps, and whatever. Get a drink if you must, but stick to the buffet.So, the prices, atmosphere, and  3-star territory. The excellent slightly-greasy flatbreads are +1 star, and +1 star for the tons of different protein options, the plethora of sauces, and the many ways that everything can be customized via the lil plastic sticks. Minus 1 star for expensive drinks.",

I went to a school where if you wanted something (decent) to eat, you had to take a bus or drive to get there.  I guess that's a win for U of I students.2. The location is easy to get to (see point 1) and there is a lot of other stuff around it too.3. It's a larger location, which is nice.4. Service was friendly and as quick as it could be (you are pretty much at the mercy of the cooks, no?)5. I found that the spread of veggies at this location seemed smaller than others.  Even some of the veggies that are listed on their \"signature\" recipe card were missing.  I would much rather see the \"staple\" veggies than the seasonal berries and figs.  Who wants to put berries and figs in their stir fry anyway?6. The staff was working hard to make sure that the sauce counter remained clean, which I can appreciate, and understand its hard, especially during move-in time at a large university when you have a lot of unruly hungry families around.7. Gave us the student discount even though my sister hadn't gotten her ID yet.  +1.",

It was just after 4 on a Saturday and we came in to have what I thought would be the only intelligent offering in a town full of children. Right! We were seated and I was one of 4 guests in the building. Our drink order was taken, and because I was in my booth so tight that I didn't want to get up to show my I.D. I changed my order to Sierra Mist! I guess the 4 inches of grey hair hanging from my chin wasn't proof enough that I am not only old enough to drink. But I am also old enough to operate an electric wheel chair! But that had nothing to do with the annoyance factor that was brewing. The kid explained what we had to do and we went on our way. Now I love rice. So much so that I could eat that alone as my meal. Both the white and brown rice tubs were completely empty! So I asked for some and was told they would bring it right out. Then I was told to make my bowl and they would bring it out when it was ready. So I asked a simple question. If you bring it out after the meal is cooked. Than the rice will still be white! With no flavor from what I put in the bowls. Three people told me that it would take 25 minutes to cook the damn rice and they all thought it was hysterical. The manager. A young girl with her hair pulled back to give her that look of authority kept pacing back and forth through the restaurant like she actually had something important to offer. The rice. Is an, if not thee essential part of what this chains menu is built upon! And then you do a group huddle to laugh about it. Now I could see my bowl from across the restaurant sitting on the edge of the griddle. When about thirty people walk in. The cook is still scraping the grill from the time I walked in the door and I knew what was going to happen next. Bowl after bowl about 8 inches higher than the rim were pushing mine further and further away from getting cooked. That's was it. I'm the dude in the Snickers commercial that needs to be fed. But. I kept my cool. Just not my Snidely Whiplash remarks. Every time a server walked by, I asked if the rice was ready yet? I cut the time of that rice down to 15 minutes and that shit was scorched like their underwear after a weekend binge! Of course when it came out I was finished with my meal. I thought that it would be fun to visit a college town and take in some sights. Fuck You! I told my buddy to get the car and lets get the hell out of here!",

You can pick whatever you want for your stir-fry (soup, etc) so you get exactly what you want (though I always end up with corn in my stir fry even though I never add it myself).  The problem is, sometimes it's nice to have somebody tell you what works well together.I pretty much only come here when I have a coupon.  It's not that it's too expensive or the food is bad, I just get a little sick of it because I always have so much leftover that I'm eating it for days.  Also, apparently I'm not very creative when it comes to stir fry because I always end up making pretty much the same thing.  I'll be honest, it gets kind of boring.  But, the veggies always seem fresh and the sausage they have at dinner is pretty tasty.  Sometimes, though, it seems like my meat doesn't get cooked all the way through.That said, here's some pro tips:- Always, always, always ask for more bread- The rice seems to be a better choice than the white noodles if you're going to have leftovers, since the noodles tend to clump together and get really mushy- Place the veggies in your bowl first, and add the rice or noodles on top.  You can fit so much more in your bowl this way.",

And when I mean next to other people, I mean right up on top of them.  There is a lot of seating but we always end up next to people, regardless.   It's close enough that you can't have a comfortable conversation with the person you are with.  They need to change that.  Otherwise, it's a great place to have a meal.",

You'd think that was impossible, since it's a flippin' buffet, but lo.  The woman whose job it was to fill up our drinks managed to only ever reach for my glass when it was going to involve sticking her arm between my chopsticks and my mouth.  Some man came over and engaged us in a lengthy dialectic about whether or not we would like him to make us some dipping sauce.  What flavors do you like?  How spicy do you want it?  For 5 minutes after our food came, during which we couldn't eat!  Then he brought us over dishes of sauce that WE COULD HAVE SELECTED OURSELVES from the buffet!Additionally, I was unsatisfied with my food.  I followed one of the sauce suggestions at the buffet, and was treated to a steaming pile of oily stir fry that literally smelled like the nasty gunk that gets stuck in a horse's shoe when it walks through a cow pasture.  The pineapple in the buffet was from a can, the meat was a low grade cut, and there was about 100 times too much oil applied to the grill.  The only reason it gets two stars instead of one is that it's got an ambience that is well above the campus mean.",

If the food isn't good--guess whose fault it is?  YOURS.Basically, Flat Top is a gussfied take on the old Mongolian Stir Fry concept.  However, there are pretty extravagant options.  You can get everything from peanut sauce, indian curry, teriyaki, or even the sublimely odd choices of pomegranate basil and \"vindahoo\" (a miswritten version of \"Vindaloo\"--yes, I kept saying \"Vindawhat? Vindahoo?\" until Archana asked me to stop).  There's a huge amount of protein options, a variety of carbs (noodles of various kinds and types of rice).The drinks are pretentious and overstuffy, but the fruit flavored lemonades are fantastic.  Also, for an obesity overload you should get a pseudo-roti bread concoction on the side.  It's free and DELICIOUS.Anyway, give Flat Top a chance.  It's well worth it.  Although a bit pricey, it's a bit tasty--if you know what you're doing.",

The last time I had Mongolian style fare was in Whistler on my honeymoon five years ago, and I loved it today as much as I did then.I would think it is hard to go wrong when I am essentially making my own lunch.  At least for me.  My husband went yesterday with a group of people and had quite a wait to get seated and started.  He also somehow managed to spoon in ladles of hot mustard in his dish, thinking \"I like hot mustard.\"  It was painful to eat.  He ended up having to start over again with help from staff to guide him to make a more palpatable plate.Today, it was all about a ladle of lemongrass water, ginger water, Korean BBQ sauce, and peanut sauce, and a touch of the really hot chili sauce.  A ton of veggies I love, enough meat to feel like I'm getting my meal's worth, and a shake of sesame seeds and I was done.  The waiter put some extra brown rice in the bowl, so I didn't have to waste valuable single bowl space with rice.  It was sooooooo good.  And hot.  Temperature is important to me.I did takeout and therefore chose the 1 bowl option, which was under $7 without tax, $7.57 with tax.  They packaged it up in a very stylish shopping bag.  Like, it's nice and sturdy enough to replace my bare hand to awkwardly carry extra shoes, lunch, and a sweater to work.Anyway, I work in Campustown, and Flat Top is convenient value for the money.  There seemed to be a lot of folks coming in to sit down for lunch.  Hubby had to wait 30 minutes yesterday.  I probably spent about 25 minutes roundtrip from my office door on Green Street to Flat Top and back. I would recommend it for takeout lunch.  It seems a bit daunting for newbies, but they get through the line the same as the rest of us, and the host gave me a short orientation before I built my bowl.  Looking at how the place is designed as an operations model, I could definitely see opportunities to improve throughput.  But eh, I'm not in that business.  I'm in the business of locating the good eatz and then savoring them with gusto.Which is what I did.  4 stars.",

While it's nothing special, it's really not that bad of a place to go on a date or grab dinner with friends as it's a new/different experience for many, its got a great location right off of Green, and you'll definitely be able to leave satisfied with a stomach full of some pretty good stuff (that is, if you know what you're doing).A design your own stir-fry chain, Flat Top offers a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and protein for your creation - all of which are fresh - and they even provide some pre-designed recipes such as Kung Pao Chicken or Peanutty Lime Noodles.  Personally, I find these recipes are only okay, so I mix and match for myself.Make sure you load up your bowl (till one extra grain of rice will send the entire thing crashing down), because, while it may look like you have a lot on there already, when everything is cooked, it shrinks in size and you'll be left with half of what you thought you were going to get and don't forget to put a blue stick in your bowl at the end!  It's Roti Prata which is athin Indian flat bread that's really really good!  And they even have breakfast now at certain locations!  I have yet to try it, but I love love love breakfast foods and this seems like it'd be an interesting experience!The downsides to this place though, is how incredibly crowded it always is.  In order to get a table if you're with a big group (which is usually the case), you have to wait around an hour to get seated and there is hardly any room to maneuver around as the tables are places so close together.  The wait staff is nice, but not always attentive as they're so busy with other customers as well.  Also, forget about coming here if you want to be able to converse with your friends as opposed to shouting across the table in order to be heard.  For the student price and what you receive, I would say it's a good deal and would come more often, but the long wait and packed seating makes it so that I only make it out there maybe once or twice a semester.",

That is not the case anymore, now you get back a  bowl of really BLAND, overcooked stuff. It doesn't even taste like stir fry, just like a bunch of dried up random bits of food. I had convinced my friend to go here instead of Chipotle and then felt really embarrassed when he had to get up to get extra sauce from the station because his food was that dry. The meal was so bad and took so long, the least I could do was pay for both our meals. Never again will I be coming back here.",

How do you loose it and why are you not immediatly asking her what was in it and re-making it ASAP.  This was a server, cook, and hostess shared FAIL.  The dish was eventually found but I was mostly done with my dish.I suggested to the hostess that some comp'ed naan would be a good idea.  This also took a long time to arrive since I had to ask about it twice and it was a mere two pieces.  We were then told that our drinks (we had 1 beer and 1 soda) would be removed from the bill only to find out that it was only the 1 soda.  That was actually worse than not offering at all.Frustrated we left and will probably not return again.  Just plain sad, sad, sad.......",

I ordered 3 items, no meat and no drink and the bill was $15. When I questioned that I explained I had wanted the small bowl, she hadn't ask, and the side soup. It came down to $10. I still felt that was pretty high. She seemed extremely annoyed that I was bothering her with this, and I kind of wanted to tell her \"honey, if you don't like your job, work someplace else.\" The food was just okay. At that price I would have liked enough to take home, but, the small portions were pretty measly and I finished it there. Someone had dumped an entire order of macaroni and cheese in the middle of the floor, and I got to stare at it while I ate. At no point did anyone come clean it up while I was there. I won't be going back anytime soon.",

Parking can be difficult since this is located in campustown, more-so when school is session, of course.  Frequently there is a line, so you may have to wait.  They do move through the ordering line quickly though.  They will give you a number and then either bring you your food (if you are staying in) or call you up (if you are doing take-out). i really like that you can pick whatever noodles/soup with whatever meat option you desire. I think there used to be a menu option that I got, but it doesn't exist anymore.  The last time I ate there, I got the pad thai- which was terrible.  I don't recommend that at all.  My parents love the thai curry soup...especially when under-the-weather. The bread is really good.  And their rice krispie treats are nice and gooey.",

The fast food chains did not look appealing. But this little spot, with a huge selection, plenty of seating, and fast service, filled the bill perfectly. I can't give it four stars because the food was uneventful. I had the Indonesian peanut saute with grilled chicken. The rice noodles were decent, the sprouts and peanuts were fine, the seasoning was nice and spicy, and it came quick and warm. My wife had the tomato basil bisque off their Mediterranean menu. She said it was like eating spaghetti sauce without the spaghetti. Not a destination, but a good lunch alternative.",

I like the variety of choices, but it can get a bit overwhelming, if you keep on wondering to yourself if the particular combination you picked will actually taste good or not. I have stuck with western-style pasta, as opposed to asian noodles (why eat faux noodles at this place when you can walk a block and have real pho noodles?). A regular bowl of noodles, meat, and a side soup will run you $8-10, which isn't enough to fill me up completely, but it is nice to enjoy some well-cooked noodles once in a while. The atmosphere is pretty great, perfect for groups of people and for individuals. It actually feels like a fast-food place disguised as a restaurant. It's very roomy inside, and there are huge windows that let you look out onto the busiest corner of campustown.",

I was looking forward to the beef stroganoff which use to be my favorite many many years ago. Luckily school is out so we got parking on the same street as the restaurant. Ordering was simple, you pick and chose from a picture menu. Many of the dishes require you to pay more for protein, some are built into the cost. The food came rather quickly. I agree with Yelp reviewer Xi S., portions are significantly smaller than I remember. I don't know if NC removed another size to the dish, but this was a lot smaller than I remember. The noodles were slightly under cook and the lack of sauce was rather troubling as many of my bites were just plain noodles. Also the employees do not appear that they want to be working here at all. Now that I have tried it, I think I will pass the next time I get an email coupon....Pros: Lots of different asian inspired noodle dishes, quickCons: small portion size, disinterested employees, under cooked noodle and lack of sauceHidden deals:1. Use the Hooked app which gives you additional savings. Dinner time savings was 2 dollar off an entree2.

Most of their more exotic dishes range from okay to the not-so-surprising 'WTH was I thinking when I ordered that' response, but a few are really good and worth coming back for.  Personally, I don't eat here unless someone else really wants to go, and then I usually order the Mac&Cheese which is my current favorite there.  Plain and simple noodles with a bunch of gooey freshly melted cheese.  Yum.  One good thing about it is that it is located in the heart of campus, so it's a convenient place to stop in for lunch or some other quick meal.  It is surrounded on several sides by completely glass windows, though, so it can be a little strange getting some private time with people from the street looking in at you.",

There are a huge amount of drink options, from wine to organic milk. Another great thing is that they have nice brochures with nutrition info and lots of healthy food options. Unfortunately, I find the food at  Noodles to be very inconsistent. Sometimes my field green salad is great, other times it is just a bunch of bland iceberg lettuce. Other selections, even those labeled spicy, are a little on the bland side. Unfortunately it's also quite pricey for campus-town and it's often incredibly crowded during lunch. Another thing that annoys me is the excessive packaging for takeout: fancy bags and containers resembling tupperware are wasteful even if they are labeled \"made with a chemical to speed up breakdown.\"But I still come back. They have food that is reasonably healthy and gives me a good dose of protein. I also like the variety of the menu.

I ordered the Pad Thai with chicken...and it was probably one of the most terrible things I've ever been served.  It was absolutely bland and half of the noodles weren't even cooked.  I couldn't eat it; I had to just throw it away!  I wasn't expecting a great Thai dish, just something edible.   So today I was running errands near Noodles and thought I would give it another try.  I ordered the Wisconsin Mac and Cheese, thinking I couldn't possibly go wrong with their \"most ordered' dish.  Unfortunately, my meal very disappointing again. It was just very plain.  Not enough sauce for all the noodles, and the sauce that was in the dish barely had any flavor.  Not worth it. I'm not sure if these issues are related to this particular store, to consistency issues, or just to poor recipes.  Either way, my two experiences warrant a rating around 1 or 2.  I'm going with a 2 since it is a nice-looking place....and they must be doing something right since it's always so crowded!  I'm just no longer willing to keep ordering until I finally find something that is ok.",

They serve Asian-style noodles, Italian pasta, and American pasta (think: macaroni and cheese etc). They also have soups and salads. You get to pick your size (regular or small), and can add ingredients (such as meat) if you like. I tried a couple of the Asian noodle dishes: they were alright but really not too impressive. I wouldn't mind so much if they were a dollar or two cheaper.",

There was nothing on the menu that looked at all appealing (too much broccoli in everything; I'm a hater,) so I ordered the mac 'n cheese because it was the least healthy looking option and therefore had the best chance of being tasty.  I got it with \"steak\" which cost like an extra $10 or some shit.  It was so expensive!  My macaroni and cheese came out, and it was so bland I put sriracha in it.  The \"steak\" was not worth the ridiculous $10, and was barely identifiable as any particular type of meat.It gets 2 stars instead of 1 because it has air conditioning and is clean.",

I've also tried the Pad Thai and the Steak Stroganoff, but I didn't care for those choices very much.   The noodles + a cookie (no drink) was $11.50, so I thought it was pretty pricey for an order of noodles that were average at best.I rarely go on campus except when school's out.  I can see why the students would like it though since it's pretty fast.  I'd go again if others dragged me there, but I think there are a lot better options both on and off campus.",

I normally don't like eating hotpot, but since they seem to specialize it in, I gave it a try. It was satisfying. The flavors are there with the right amount of spiciness. I would recommend it to anyone who likes korean food. The service was great too. We had the private room at the back. They checked on us consistently.",

I ordered the bulgogi bento box and boy was he right!  It was excellent!   I inhaled everything in a matter of minutes.... Not sure what everything was (bulgogi, tempura, rice, a macaroni type of salad and then these gelatinous type of things) but it was great!   I also ordered the kimchi soup and that was great too but it took me a while to finish because it was almost too spicy for me.  Everything came out to $11.  A welcome addition to Champaign!

                "review": "Giving Yori Q a 4/5 rating with a caveat to be explained later.  Suffice it to say with one exception, the food was excellent and I'll definitely be returning often to eat here.  Review is based upon taste, service, and value metrics.First taste.  We ordered a boodae jungol, corn pahjun, egg jjim, and some spicy dahk bbq stuff.  I'm going to go ahead and mention the \"exception\" mentioned earlier.  Anything on their menu which is a hot plate or whatever, with spicy bulgogi, pork or chicken... I would stay away from all of those items.  Our dahk bbq hot dish thing was an abomination.  The chicken was not cleaned, so we were eating huge pieces of fat, unrendered skin.  And on top of that, they cooked the chicken, but they did not get rid of the grisly cooked chicken blood.  It should be a standard practice to clean the chicken, and once its cooked to skim off any grisly cooked blood so that the customer isn't eating that.  But every mouthful of it is either fat and skin, paired with a goopy, and grisly cooked chicken blood consistency.  It was basically inedible.  I'll go ahead and throw in the value aspect of these dishes as well.  At the 14 dollar price point, everything in that section of the menu is the biggest rip off.  Portion size did not at all justify the price point, paired with the horrible blandness, fat, unrendered skin, and grisly chicken blood... if I could give a 0/5 on the basis of this dish alone I would.  But the fact of the matter is, everything in that submenu of hot dishes is a complete rip off, and until they double the portion sizes of all of those dishes, and remedy their preparation issues, I would stay far away from all of those items.NOW, with that horrible exception out of the way... the good news is, the corn pahjun, egg jjim, and all of the ban chan they gave us was absolutely perfect and excellent.  The Corn pahjun, where it looked WAY overdressed and oversauced, it was actually quite balanced.  A little more acid in the sauce would have been nice, but it was delicious nonetheless.  The egg jjim was more or less a test of execution of a classic ban chan, which they did well.  It was delicious and well prepared.  The boodae jungol was also quite excellent.  I think my defacto standard for boodae jungol is at san soo gab san in Chicago.  And on the basis of taste, Yori Q's interpretation of it was right on par.  It was just enough spicy.  They did put a bunch of \"cheap meat\" in it like spam, and hotdogs, and didn't put any premium meat in it, like chadulbaegee, and put VERY LITTLE samgyepsahl, so it didn't really meet expectations as far as ingredients both in protein and veggies, but it at least tasted good.  So aside from the exception that is that dahk bbq, (which should get a -50 out of 5), I will give the rest of the meal a 5/5.  Very delicious.Service.  Service was great.  A guy named Andrew was our server.  He was excellent, warranting a giant tip.  If you go to Yori Q, request that Andrew be your server, he was excellent, knowledgeable, and friendly.  He will no doubt make your dining experience improve on his demeanor, and excellence as a server alone.  In general the food was ordered, and came out in a short time.  Our server was attentive, refilling our drinks and ban chan, and being receptive to our comments on the food.  5/5 easily on service.Some things they could have done better with our boodae jungol is to cut the ramen noodles, and provided a better array of veggies, and premium meats in it.  The extremely long ramen noodles made it impossible to serve out the boodae into smaller cups without lifting your arm 5 feet above the wok, all the while hot boodae juice is falling and splashing all over your clothes.  Value.  So again, with the hot dishes as an exception, meaning the dahk bbq we got, and every other item in that submenu, I easily give Yori Q a 5/5 on value.  Though I will say, if they do not correct the portion sizes and preparation problems with those dishes the next time we go, their overall rating will drop on this review to a 2/5.  But the boodae jungol was reasonably priced since it was delicious, and the appetizers were not terribly overpriced.  Even with the horrible dahk bbq, our ticket was $52 before tip, which, if you remove the dahk bbq from the equation, it was very reasonable.  So again, aside from the hot dishes, bbq dishes sub menu, Yori Q gets a 5/5 on value.  All in all a 4/5 experience I think.  They will get repeat business from us.  And we'll see if they lower the prices on the hot dishes, double the portion sizes, and correct the preparation issues.  Hopefully I won't be coming back to this review and stamping a 2/5 stars on it.  All things considered, Yori Q is a good place to go, just be sure you ask people what to get before you go, lest you end up with a mouth full of creamy cooked chicken blood, unrendered chicken skin, and chicken fat to eat with your rice.",

After trying all the korean restaurants in town, I must say I was used to having to settle for restaurants with positive aspects and mediocre aspects, food wise, service, ambiance, price. Tried this place twice before leaving and both times I had a great experience. Having lived in Los Angeles I know the standards for korean restaurants pretty well. This place excelled in all aspects. For being a brand new restaurant the service was very attentive and fast, which is unusual for restaurants with training staff. They made sure we were satisfied with our meal. The ambiance hasn't change much since the last asian restaurant in the location but was given a rather simple but clean facelift. Ive tried the spicy chicken stew, naegmyon and other dishes and all of them where very flavourful and generous portions, especially considering other korean restaurants in town. If the service and food quality persist in this restaurant it will definitely be the go to place for everyone in town craving korean food.",

I had the dolsat bibambap for my entree and it wasn't the best. I don't eat a lot of bibambap but this one had way too much rice and not enough stuff. There were also only about 4 or 5 very small pieces of bulgogi. I know bibambap is vegetable focused, but this was just disappointing. The worst part was the fried egg in the bibambap. It arrived at our table with a completely rock solid yolk. Even worse, the bowl next to mine's yolk was not only rock solid, but also broken, leaving a dried up trail around the bowl. Not good. However, the pork neck bone soup was well received and pleasantly spicy. The bulgogi entree was also very good, generous portion of beef to make up for the complete lack of beef in the bibambap. I didn't try the hot pot which they are supposedly known for. I'd recommend this place for bulgogi or soups/hot pot, but I'd stay away from the bibambap.",

Everything tasted great and, most importantly, the service was amazing. I was there for maybe 45 minutes and I was asked if I needed anything at least 6 times.The bad:While everything was great, the bibimbap left more to desire in regards to the bulgogi. It was one of those instances where I felt like I took 3 bites of meat and the rest was rice and veggies. But it was only $10, so can't complain too much. Overall, Yori Q is a great Korean food option in the area and I'll definitely be back eventually.",

This was the first time I tried Korean food. Lucy was our server and she was awesome. Very helpful in making suggestions for lunch and she patiently explained what everything was to four old guys. The food came out quickly and everything was piping (do people still say that?) hot. The soup, served in a stone bowl, was still boiling. Highly recommended.",

A must get is the corn jeon, or gamja jungal(I think that's what it is called). They recently decreased the portion size of the dolsot bimbamp which is slightly dissapointing but oh well. Bubble tea here is also one of the best I've had but not sure if it is worth $5. Gonna try kbbq on Wednesday.",

Even perfect for a group of 4, if you want to eat a satisfying amount & know that you will get dessert afterwards ;) Side dishes were all very good too - just wish they had offered about 2-3 more. Service- Really good & quick. Very friendly too! They're really good about filling up waters, empty side dishes, & such. I can't wait for their dessert bar & grill area to open up!",

The servers are friendly and attentive. The $1 sushi deals on Sundays and Mondays are worth it. My favorite is definitely the big roll; I believe it has egg, crabmeat, avocado and some other stuff, then tempura fried with some sort of sauce on top. The best deal...and I'm kinda mad that I found out right before I graduated...is the lunch buffet! It's sucha great deal. Only weekdays though. The buffet is only around $10 and includes various entrees, such as curry chicken, fried fish croquettes, kimchi, soup, fried rice, noodles and three different types of sushi. The big roll is usually one of the three. Definitely keeps you full without breaking your wallet. :)",

I've only eaten it on dollar sushi nights, which, now that I think about it, is a spectacular bargain.For a Champaign restaurant, Kofusion has a very modern look; frosted glass, colored lights, and random decorations add to the very un-Champaign look and feel, which is refreshing at times.I've also been told that they hold salsa nights here, though I haven't experienced it. Overall, great place on those dollar sushi nights. Can't say much for the rest.",

The last time in town I went and sat at the bar yet time passed and nobody was there. I flagged down the host to see if they even had a bartender on staff and they grabbed one girl who got me started, some other guy showed up and said he entered my food, then some other guy finished as I was looking around for \"bartender: #2\" to get my check.

The ingredients are fresh and the flavors are wonderful, but they use chili oil instead of fresh chilis, so it makes it too greasy.If you adore chocolate, you must must must order the Valhrona chocolate gelato.

With sushi this good, I would be satisfied with a hole-in-the-wall location.  However, KoFusion is classy!  There are tanks of fish, complicated ambient lighting, waterfalls, and many other clever design elements. HIGHLY recommend.",

I ordered the chirashi (my go to dish at sushi places when I am not sharing) And while the portion was decent,  the tuna and octopus both tasted slightly off, like it was old. The other fish on the plate,  while fresh, just didn't have a lot of flavor. In short you pay a lot for pretty average fish, almost 1.5-2x what I would pay for the quality I recieved(depending on the dish)  there are many better places in the area, that have tastier fish and are a bit more reasonably priced.",

What kind of customer service is that? Crap is what I say!

Which would have been okay had the fried tempura outside not tasted like bad oil that need to be changed. The Coconut & Mango Roll was very interesting and I really enjoyed it. It contained coconut shrimp which was a unique sushi ingredient to me. I would go back again for that roll and soup and call it it a day. My lunch companions buffet comments: The Salmon Miso soup would have been worth the price of the buffet alone! Sweet potato noodles, and the chicken curry were excellent. He thought the quality of all the dishes was great for a buffet and while the selection was smaller it was worth it based on how well each dish was prepared. In addition the service was very good, friendly and attentive.",

Dollar sushi is a special discount night, and as such will be a different dining experience then typical dining hours.  Its not an \"off\" night its just a different dining experience than a Saturday, and yes I'm sure the servers are more frazzled on these busier nights.  Also, people who rate on just the sushi alone need to realize that this is only a portion of the menu.  I love the sushi here, but I also love the creations of chef Nigel.  I have been here dozens of times in my undergrad years and it was always memorable.  The owner might have high standards in her servers, but that's because she expects high standards in everything in her restaurants.  The bathrooms are immaculate!  The food is incredible!  The drinks are amazing and inventive!  Really, this place has such a warm spot in my heart.  For the middle of Illinois, it doesn't get more creative and amazing than this.  Love Ko Fusion!",

My friend invited me today to meet her for sushi at K.O. and I was looking forward to it. We got there at 11:15, and the server was really nice and very attentive. That's about all I can give this place. I ordered a chicken Bento box that was $15 - I cringed when I saw the price, but the server reassured me that it was \"a LOT\" of food. The box came, and it had chicken stir fry that was pretty plain. Then it had 4 little pieces of California roll that were OK. There was a lump of rice that was undercooked. There were a few pieces of lettuce with an overpowering ginger sauce on it. I'm a very hungry person and I'm the least picky eater I know, and I didn't finish the Bento box. It's not because I wasn't hungry - it's because I couldn't. But what's more, there was certainly NOT $15 worth of food on that plate -- it wasn't \"a LOT\" of food. I ordered veggie dumplings for my daughter, who seemed to liked them. I thought they were pretty good, but they were lukewarm (the server made a big deal about how hot they were - and they were definitely not). The bill came and it was almost $25. For $25, I better have eaten the very best lunch of my life!! And I would've been more satisfied with a $5 footlong, sadly. This place is ridiculous. They have some nerve to charge so much money for food that's not even up to par with cheap fast food. The other restaurants downtown, for the most part, are pretty good. They're still overrated, but better than K.O.! I won't be back.",

However, don't be fooled by the $1... after a couple glasses of wine/beer and an edamame appetizer with your dollar sushi you can still expect your bill to be at least $25-30 per person- but it's worth it! The only catch with dollar sushi nights is that the service is usually very slow.The lunch buffet was really disappointing and in my opinion overpriced. We arrived at noon and much of the food on the buffet seemed as if it had been sitting in the warmer- tough/dry chicken, over cooked edamame, warm sushi.... Skip it and order from the menu.",

Sushi was very below average and I found the selection of nigiri sparse. I don't think it would have been as upsetting if it wasn't so expensive, but even if were priced less, I still cannot say that it was delicious. My bf and I had one drink, one $15-16 maki roll (only five pieces on the plate though), nigiri (2 pieces at 2 bucks a piece), and sushi plate B (which had very few actual sushi for the price) and it was around $70 something. I could not believe it because that was my grocery bill for the whole week and I got a measly meal. We both left still feeling empty in the stomach. I'm not a super chef, but I know how to cook and even to make sushi myself. The rice used was not right. Sushi rice is not the rice you just scoop out of your pot or rice cooker rolled into shapes. There is a preparation process for the rice which adds rice wine vinegar, sweetness, and brings out a slight chewiness that complements the raw fishes and whatnots. KoFusion didn't even do this.The fish was not very flavorful either. The amount of rice used for the nigiri was about 2/3 the proper amount. Rolls were shot with a shrink ray. Everything was just off. The decor was really, I dunno ... just very odd. It's the like uncool kid trying to be really cool. There was neon, walls with bubbles, odd colors, tiles, weird blue lighting, odd shapes. I dunno, maybe this is what is \"trendy\" back then or something but it looks really odd to me. The waiters were fine. i was surprised to hear that our waiter has worked there for over two years. She knew what she was doing. I'm not looking for heaping portions, exquisite tastes at dirt cheap prices. I just want a good portioned meal, tastes good to the average person, and at a reasonable price. KoFusion missed the mark on all of them. Maybe it was just that night or because of new management. I remember KoFusion actually used to be good several years ago.  I was shocked to see how different the quality of food that is being served now. Small portion, wallet shrinking, bland and poorly made sushi. Oh and odd decor.",

                "review": "When friends ask me to describe this restaurant, I jokingly say, \"It's the kind of place where people eat their sushi with a fork and knife.\"To Kofusion's credit, it's the only venue in this rural Midwest town that attempts the urban dance-club sushi experience. Against that backdrop, it really is filling a unique niche. East Coast + West Coast elitist diners will likely be unimpressed (if you're ensnared here for years due to work or school, the nostalgia/desperation for big city experiences might change your mind).Arguably, if you're eating at an Asian fusion restaurant, you should have no expectations of \"authenticity\" in regards to the food. The drink selection features fruity cocktails with sexy, \"exotic\" names and $9+ price tags. Many items on the menu are outright American cuisine lacking even a hint of \"fusing\" with Asian elements. In that respect, this place is ideal for groups made up of both adventurous diners and those who fear \"fish breath.\"The biggest draw for Kofusion are the Sunday and Monday $1 sushi specials. Folks with raw food aversions need not worry. All of the $1 sushi options are variations of deep-fried meats, cream cheese filling, and mayonnaise/sugary sauces. There's such a demand on these nights that the preparation definitely cuts corners--but if you're filling up on these bite-sized heart-attacks, you're likely channeling your inner fat kid and won't mind the rushed presentation.For people who love Japanese cuisine for its delicate, clean flavors, the sushi bar also serves more \"traditional\" fare, though I've sometimes received pieces of sashimi sliced rather clumsily.My advice: the $1 price tag for the Sunday/Monday specials requires such little investment that it's worth a shot for new diners. It might even be the best opportunity for initiating people who are normally turned off by the idea of sushi.",

The sushi rice was hard, cold and tasteless, the toppings,so-so. If you want mediocre sushi in a trendy setting with a bunch of good looking people, this is the place. Otherwise go down the street to Sushi Kame, where they take the time and care to prepare sushi the right way without having to fork out an arm and a leg.",

                "review": "I often get dragged here every few weeks with coworkers since it is close to my work.  I have not been impressed one time.  I got to admit the inside is uniquely decorated, but I dislike almost everything else about this restaurant.  To start, the waiters are really rude and arrogant.  They all seem to have this pompous flair to them and I don't know why.  It most certainly does not make a good server.  They seem to act disgusted almost every time you ask them for something, and are neglectful of your table way more often that not.  It's not surprising for them to forget your table completely... The owner is also very arrogant, and acts sickeningly (and fake-ly) nice as she wanders aimlessly around the restaurant.  The food is alright, but most is very underwhelming to me.  The food is not very authentic, (aside from the sushi) and is more of an Americanized Asian restaurant (much like P.F. Changs), and I tend to hate those types of restaurants.  When I want Asian food, I want REAL Asian food.  Not crappy American creations labeled as Chinese food.  It's pretty expensive too.  Way overpriced in my opinion.  There is a $10 lunch buffet, but there are often only 4 entrees to choose from, and not much else in the ways of other food.  Fried and white rice?  Usually two plates of generic (and really cheap) sushi?  Totally not worth $10 at all.  Order from the menu for lunch and you are looking at paying over $10.  Dinner is even worse.  While I only went once for dinner, and usually end up here for the lunch buffet, the time I did go for dinner was terrible.  The menu is almost set up like a gourmet restaurant, as there's not a big selection at all, and most meals cost around $20.  O_O  The worst part is, the entrees come out on huge plates with the tiniest bit of food in the middle.  They call it New Age Dining but I call it \"I just got seriously ripped off\"I ordered the salmon dish.  It was $21 I think.  Ridiculous, I know.  Well, it came out raw in the middle.  I sent it back, 10 minutes later it comes back, and still raw.  I had to send it back twice and even after the third time it came back it did not taste right to me.  And like I said, it was the tiniest portion ever.  It was maybe a 6oz salmon filet on a plate garnished with sauce next to like a 1/4 cup of rice.... it really is pitiful.  My friend's entrees were similarly scarce looking.  I really don't know how this place gets so packed when it is so expensive and the food is not that good.  It's touted as a huge date spot as well, but I'm surprised most stomach up the huge entry cost.  I hear the sushi is great but I never had anything other than the stuff they put out on the lunch buffet and it was terrible.  It seems expensive too like everything else.  Some praise the $1 sushi night, but that's per piece and personally to me that seems like a high price as well....  I would stay away if I were you, I often even find myself backing out of lunch with my coworkers simply because I can not stand this restaurant any more.",

                "review": "I was in a business in Champaign and asked the employee there for a recommendation for Japanese food/sushi.  He said Kofusion, so I looked it up Yelp.In spite of the assorted poor reviews, I went to Kofusion for dinner anyway, since it was Monday and I read (here) that it's Dollar Sushi on Monday.  It took a few minutes even to get to the hostess, who said there was a long wait (the place was packed), but I could sit at the bar immediately.  She responded in the affirmative when I asked if I could order from the same menu.So sit at the bar I did.  For the uninitiated, the 'dollar sushi' is per PIECE, not per ROLL.  So, calculate accordingly.  However, these are not your regular old California rolls, or good ole spicy tuna, salmon skin roll, etc.  These are fancier and more intricate rolls, and priced rather low.  Take a look:  http://www.kofusion.com/?page_id=255I didn't have any idea which would be the best, so I got the sampler (10 pieces, $10).  Actually I got 2 orders :-)It's a little hard figuring out which piece was which sometimes, but the bartender offered to help me several times, and they left the menu with me, which I thought was a nice touch, so I could cross-reference what I was eating. The sushi was totally worth it.    Reading the other reviews, the only thing I can surmise is that the bad reviews came from people who had to wait too long, or maybe the staff has been changed recently.  I had no problem with anyone there; the hostess, the two bartenders who served me, and a woman, who may have been the owner(?) who came and very nicely asked me to move one barstool over so she could seat a party of two next to eachother.Parking is a problem here as with anywhere near the university.  There was a sign on the door saying they validate 2 hour parking for a parking lot, but since I didn't know that, didn't know where the lot was, and had already fed the meter on the street, I didn't think anything of it.The decor was nice, especially against the backdrop of the other restaurants I had been in since driving around eastern Illinois and western Indiana for the past few days.Go to Kofusion and get sushi-  you won't regret it.",

The place has a nice atmosphere and is certainly more thought out than your typical CU restaurant. Is it trying too hard? Maybe, but let's be honest any attempt at trying could be perceived as \"trying to hard\" here because most places don't make any effort at all.So... shame about the food. I've only tried to eat from their non-sushi menu twice and have been disappointed each time. They're main dishes are over-priced and lack flavor. I will say their seafood had a nice, fresh taste but they don't really do anything with it. I'd recommend getting some friends, ordering a couple baskets of edamame, some drinks and many different kinds of sushi. My favorite is definitely the Lava Roll.",

The other tv had the Bulls game so my eyes often wandered away from my date and to this tv (sorry, sweetie). The server was prompt and provided the specials. I decided to go with the Tuna rolls (the standard which I compare these kinds of restaurants) and the chicken stir-fry. The tuna rolls had the largest diameter of meat that I have seen in C-U and it was of a good quality. My only complaint was the meagerness of the serving but they made up for it with a lot of meat for each roll and the neat stacked arrangement of the rolls. The stir fry I really enjoyed! All of their meat dishes seemed to accommodate those who want free-range and humanely treated livestock. For the price and the hype, I was somewhat satisfied. I still think Sushi Kame is the better place to go for Japanese food and sushi and it is not as crowded and loud.

I really like the tuna crunch roll, like a lot. As oddly specific as this might be, it is in my top 5 pieces of sushi ever. The bulk of my 10-12 pieces usually consist of these guys. I also enjoy the wagyu beef and BBQ pork roll, which are sort of a nice change up. People also seem to enjoy the big roll, though I take a pass because I'm not a fan of mushrooms.OK, so that necessarily doesn't earn the 4 star rating. It's good, relatively inexpensive (unless you're trying to eat 392 pieces) and the location is good. What gets the extra star is that the service is always on point and great. Knowing that people cherry picking what types of sushi they want can cause an error prone environment, the servers (and I suppose cooks/sushi-makers) usually get it right. When they don't, it's fixed quickly.Awesome!",

If not the best sushi I have had, but given that is Uchi in Houston or Austin so that is not completely fair, it is still serviceable.  The atmosphere is great and modern looking without being stuffy or overly chic for no reason.  The patio area is one of the best downtown.The spot is always packed, even on a Monday during the summer when all the U of I students are gone.  So service is a little swamped, but they will check on you when they get a chance and kitchen times are usually spot on.A handful of micros on tap.  Various offerings from Oskar Blues, Dogfish Head, and Bells.  Sushi can be anywhere from very good to meh.  There has been enough inconsistency for me to not give this a full four star.  Sometimes they just over do it, and other times it might not be the freshest.  My latest visit on Monday I had the Unagi roll, which is fresh water eel.  Very good, if not exceptional.  This was done in a very tasteful way and not over done, like some other rolls can be.  They just always fall short of exceptional to me.  Even so, that won't stop me from making other visits in the future.  They are a downtown staple, and try hard.  Certainly a good spot that sometimes falls a little short.",

Dollar sushi nights used to feature around 10 rolls at discounted prices, each week a few of the rolls on the dollar menu would differ from the ones offered the week before.  The service was HORRIBLE, but the sushi made up for it and at $1 a piece you are paying around 70% of normal price (and since they are so overpriced at Ko to begin with this meant you were paying what you would pay anywhere else).Lately I've stopped going to Ko for several reasons.  The dollar sushi menu no longer changes.  It is nearly CONSTANT from week to week.  Sure it's a super discount so you can't complain too much.  However, sometimes some of the sushi you order comes to the table reeking of fish.  The pieces are $1 because clearly the fish is old.  And finally the service is utterly horrible on Sunday/Monday nights.  Sure they are busy, but the wait staff simply suck.To sum it up you can get sushi that is just as good and just as cheap at several other places in Champaign/Urbana.  Branch out a bit, trendy neon lights that change color don't mean the food is good.",

They were going to sit us at a table but my brother requested a booth instead and they were happy to oblige our request.  At recommendation of our waiter me and my brother both got their sangria.  Sangria was strong and very good.  We ordered their seafood/cheese rolls as an appetizer.  The rolls were perfectly crispy, with a nice amount of filling, with a nice sweet sauce to dip it in.  We ordered several rolls (the flaming phoenix, firecracker, fusion, and the Philadelphia roll).  I gotta give top marks to the originality and presentation of the flame phoenix.  The sushi was acceptable but is not going to blow anyone away whose had good sushi.  The rice was a little too chewy and the firecracker was very flimsy with its thinly sliced pieces of jalapeo.  I liked Kofusion and would definitely go back.  But its very expensive and the sushi is only ok.  When we decided we needed another roll we had to ask another waiter to track down our waitress (who had gotten busy with her other tables). Other than that minor flaw, I thought the service was very good.",

The soothing neon lights, aquariums, and smooth lines of the sushi bar are pretty marvelous on the eyes.

Can get a little pricey depending on what you order, but for the most part, the food is worth it. Never had a bad experience there.",

I enjoyed it last time but I remember it being pretty expensive so I've been visiting cheaper sushi places in the interim. KoFusion today left me pretty disappointed. First of all, our waitress gave a really strong impatient vibe. I got the impression that she was staying late or covering for someone else because there were additional customers she wasn't expecting late in the day. She was pretty slow with refilling my water and was trying to take our menus away right as we ordered a roll of sushi for an appetizer. It was like she was trying to discourage us from ordering more. At the time, my mom knew what she wanted but I wasn't ready yet so, I decided to wait until later. When she came back to check, I asked about the sushi bowl. I've never heard of a sushi bowl before and wanted to make sure I wasn't ordering anything I wouldn't like so I asked the waitress to describe it. Seems like a simple request right? Her response was \"the description in the menu is pretty obvious\". Come on, don't you think I read the description first? Even if I hadn't, isn't it her job to talk about the dishes in the menu from her perspective in more detail than what's on the menu? I was very disappointed with her response. After continuing to talk about what sushi bowls could be from what I read, she did reaffirm my assumptions but it would have been nice to have gotten there without the sarcasm. Also, she completely forgot to take my mom's order. If my mom didn't shout what she wanted as our waitress walked away, we would have had to wait until she returned again later. In the end, the food was delicious. I love the sweet and spicy sauce that the sushi bowl came with and if you like raw fish but want something a little different than regular sushi or when others aren't into sushi and you want something for yourself, I would definitely recommend it. For almost $20, I was a little disappointed to see imitation crab but overall it was a good balance of savory, tart, sweet, and spicy.With so many other cheaper and friendlier sushi options, I can't imagine that KoFusion will be lasting much longer when these kinds of experiences are what they're offering. Also, I'm pretty sure we walked in right as dollar sushi was starting which I didn't remember until we were on our way out. Why didn't anyone mention the deal? It's almost like they're discouraging you from spending money there!",

Then it's almost acceptable for the quality of the sushi you get.Everything else is pretty mediocre, yet they're charging for a higher end restaurant price. You're paying for atmosphere and that's about it. Yet, this is the best sushi place located in the CU area in terms of quality. So if you're desperate for sushi and have loads of money, give this place a try.",

Our server was probably the most attentive I've had so far in C-U, but I don't know if that was because it wasn't very busy (the undergrads haven't gotten back to campus yet) or because I was with 5 very attractive female grad students. In any case, drinks were always kept filled and the sushi came very promptly. There are drink specials also on Monday nights: $3.50 bottles of sake and $4 glasses of wine, about 4 each to choose from. We had the hot sake and I had a glass of the Riesling, which was nicely balanced (not too sweet.. very nice for sushi). There were ten rolls available for $1, and we were not required to order all ten of them. I tried one of each except for the organic beef and the alfredo roll. My favorites were the big roll and the crunch roll, which was topped with a nice spicy sauce. The rolls were not very large for being \"special\" rolls, and I definitely would not order one from the regular menu (some were listed as high as $23 for one roll?). It was really fun to go and pick and choose and compare with my friends though. I will be back for $1 night! With wine, sushi, and tip, I spent $23 and was stuffed!",

The first time I went there my friends dragged for \"dollar sushi\" night. I thought I was getting robbed more than saving money, the pieces they give you are very small. The only reason why is its a dollar is because you have to eat like 10 pieces to fill up. The second time I went in there, we ordered a few rolls, and they took quite a while, when I looked over at the customers next to us, it looked like what we ordered, turned out it was. The girls were like, \"this is not what we ordered and had sat on there table for 5 mins before the waitress came and brought it to our table,at that point we just ate and left, she didnt even get a tip. The 2 other times were just as bad, I'll save you time and money, and tell you to try the other sushi places in town.",

The waitstaff was a little harried but it was extremely busy, but they really tried very hard to be attentive. Brian, our server was racing back and forth and came by often to check but when I did need something it was a little hard to get him. He did get back with me as soon as he could with any request I had and was quick with the refills of their Jasmine/Green tea.I got a couple pieces of their $ sushi. The waygu beef was really good, and it was cooked all right-not over done-the right shade of pink. The dynamite roll was also really tasty-really savory and I was surprised that they didn't skimp on the fish.I also got the Hwe Dop Bop which our server didn't know what it was until I pointed it out on the menu. Hwe Dop Bop, by the way is like bibimbap but with sashimi, like the Korean version of chirashi. It didn't come with the 'spicy, red sauce' that it was supposed to come with and I brought this up and he said it already comes with but he could bring me more-that was a little weird that he didn't even look at my dish. However, he did bring me more without asking when I used up what he gave me. Not a bad place, I would probably show up here again if I'm in the CU area, but probably not for $1 sushi-too busy.",

They also have nigiri, but I don't like eating raw fish, so I haven't tried theirs. Hands down my favorite roll is the flaming phoenix. It is a masterpiece from start to finish. It come out flaming (just like the name says) and has many different elements of flavor to it. The $1 sushi is Sunday and Monday. I would suggest trying the sampler if you are not familiar with their different kinds of rolls. After coming here many times, I know which ones I do and don't like. Just read the descriptions and you will be fine picking your sushi. GO TO THE LUNCH BUFFET. They only serve 2-3 types of sushi, but you can stock up that day and get your fill. They also have doughnuts, spicy chicken, edamame , rice, and salad. The outdoor seating is relaxing and has a good vibe. Just like any other restaurant, it is not preferable to sit outside when it is hot and humid. The space inside is cool and dark. It can get loud sometimes because the tables are close together. I also enjoy their different types of tea. They switch out their tea selections frequently. It comes in a smaller sized pot, but the leaves are good for about 2-3 steepings.

If my friend and her boys weren't already there, I would have turned around and left. I got a really bad first impression. It was busy (but nobody else was at the hostess station) and the hostess asked me if she could help me. I said that I was looking for my friend and her two young sons. She got really snotty, rolled her eyes and said, \"Well, you're just going to have to look for them yourself.\" Maybe she was just having a bad day. Who knows. I walked around and still didn't see them when another hostess came up and asked if SHE could help me. I told her who I was looking for and she goes, \"Oh! I know right where they are, come with me.\" She was cheerful and really helpful. It made up for the other super, rude hostess. We had the best waiter I have ever had in this town. No kidding. I saved my receipt so I could remember his name. It was Luke H. He was super attentive, extremely polite, friendly, and really sweet to my friend's kids. Our drinks never went empty and he checked in on us plenty without being annoying or hovering. Being dollar sushi night, I expected a longer wait for our food but our rolls were out quickly. They were all really good, too. The edamame and dumplings were great, also. Super big thanks to Luke H. and the NICE hostess. Hope the other one's attitude improves.",

The first thing you notice is the dcor:  indoor seating is cozy, with an outdoor patio section, ambient lighting and nice candles on the tables (a small detail, but something I love :)    My friend had sushi rolls while I had select pieces of nigiri (salmon, smoked salmon, tuna, shrimp, and tuna caviar).  Now this review may be biased due to the weeks of sushi-deprivation I had experienced prior to coming in...but the food was delicious!  The pieces were well-cut, artfully arranged, and you could tell the fish was good quality.  The best part of the night (aside from the great company) was the service.  The waiter was very friendly, entertaining, and came by many times to checkup on us.  The service really took the whole dining experience up a notch.    P.S.  The mojitos were great too!  Will definitely be coming back for more sushi and drinks nights.",

And the peach tea is some of the best tea I've ever had. The decor is pretty stylin and if you come at the right time, you don't have to wait very long, if at all, to get a table.

The main reason is that they seem really good at sourcing the best ingredients. Everything on the menu seems to have a pedigree: Immerwald Farms Pork, wild line-caught fish, and Wagyu beef are typical menu items.Dinner can get quite pricey, but the service is good and the food is delicious. I can't say it's as creative as other establishments in town, but it's done well. I also love that they have meats like wild boar on the menu. The exception is Sunday and Monday, which is $1 sushi night. The sushi isn't the greatest, but it's decent enough and I'll merrily eat it despite the fact that you aren't supposed to eat seafood on those days because they are probably leftovers. Oh well. Lunch is far more affordable, especially on Mondays when they have $1 Sushi. I think the Bento Box, which has quite a lot of food, is a good deal. Recently it's had salmon cake, California rolls, Wagyu beef/organic chicken, rice, vegetables, and a salad, but the contents vary. I think I could make two meals out of it and they do allow takeout, but usually I devour it pretty quickly because it's so good.Many people think the interior here is suave, but if you look at it long enough it just looks tacky.",

The quality of the food is high and Ko-Fusion does a good job of simulating your typical big city Asian-Fusion, neon lights, lounge music type place. The dollar sushi is a great deal and the rotating options are tasty though sort of cheapish in that they feature a lot of imitation crab based rolls. However for a buck a piece, it's a fair enough trade-off. On my last visit, my gf and I each ordered tea and the server forget which pot was which. To check she practically shoved her nose in one pot to take a whiff and figure it out. Ko-Fusion is good but not great.",

I'd been here a long time ago (like a year and a half ago) right after the place opened, and it was kind of dead and empty. But I went again a couple of nights ago, and the place was fairly crowded and happening. I was by myself so I sat at the bar, where the bartender took very good care of me.First a few words about the place: it's fairly large, with two different seating areas separated by the bar area, and they obviously spent the bucks on the decor. It's fairly modern, with a black and dark blue color scheme, a (fairly) beautiful bar, etc... You somehow can't help thinking that maybe they tried a little too hard to look sophisticated, but nonetheless it makes for a fairly good ambiance.The food is a mix of Asian (mostly Japanese) and new American. I'm usually weary of fusion... but it wasn't bad at all. The first time I was here, I ordered the chirashi, which wasn't the best I've had in my life but was surprisingly decent considering the location (as far from any ocean as you can be in the country...). This time, I started with a seaweed salad (tasty), followed by the whole trout, which came with sauteed mushrooms and spinach... The trout was pretty good, and the veggies delicious. I finished with the black sesame ice-cream: for $4, I expected a tiny little scoop, but I was served a heaping bowl of ice-cream with a strawberry and a wafer... just great.Not to forget their drinks: they have a pretty large selection of wine and sake, as well as a full bar. I had one of their specialty cocktails (the ko-tini: sake, absolut, and peach schnapps in a martini glass... pretty good), and another mixed drink. I was especially shocked to see how inexpensive they were, being used to NY prices.Based on the food only, I would have given this place 3-1/2 to 4 stars, but the service was top notch. The bartender was extremely friendly and efficient, and treated me very well... I'll probably be back.",

Honestly, they'd probably get knocked down a star if it weren't for that one delightfully spicy roll. I've not been for dollar sushi days on Monday, but it sounds like a great way to try new rolls. Their lunch buffet is pretty good. They have a limited amount of sushi and what they do have is pretty safe: california rolls/fried rolls. They also have curry and salad on the buffet. It's a little pricier at over $10/person, but the food is good. Definitely worth a shot if you're interested in checking out some safer food options. For me, I want all things spicy!

Firstly, people should recognize the restaurant for what it is: Korean fushion food. Thus, there's a wide variety of sushi, my personal favorite: hwe dup bap (like sashimi salad) and a smaller selection of hot (but still great--scallops anyone?) entrees that I usually have no interest in because I love sushi that much. If you need a quick sushi fix, dollar sushi Sundays (1 roll = $1) will definitely satisfy your cravings. There are 10 rolls that are offered at that price and they are definitely more of an American style sushi roll (read: little to no raw fish). At first I was really disappointed by this, but I honestly felt like the other rolls were good enough (Big Roll! Coconut Roll!) that I didn't mind at all and eat about $15-$20 worth of sushi anyway. Yes, I am a sushi whore. If you really want good sushi (with more raw fish or more interesting combinations), Kofusion is still the place to go. Their sushi menu is surprisingly extensive with your typical simple salmon rolls to rainbow-type rolls and more. It's about $1-$2 dollars more expensive than the other places in town but I've never felt like my rolls weren't worth the cost. Finally, Kristina is my favorite waitress. Maybe she remembered me for my order (hwe dup bap--seriously, try it if you love raw fish, it is divine) or maybe because I loved her so much I tipped well, but after just a few weeks of going weekly, a lot of the waiters remembered me and greeted me warmly. As a sushi lover, it doesn't really get any better than this. I'm not going to lie, Kofusion hits your wallet pretty hard but in the world of sushi, I don't find them especially more expensive than other sushi places that offer the same variety and quality of rolls. One recommendation I have is to try and get a roll (i.e. Big Roll--that's the one I had) wrapped in soy/rice paper. For those that don't like sushi because of the seaweed, this is a great alternative. For those that still love sushi, try it anyway--it's a great substitution that's worth it to get on its own once in awhile. I will forever miss Kofusion now that I'm not in the area so please, go get the hwe dup bap, Big Roll, Coconut Roll, or even the thai curry for me please!",

On regular nights - it can be seen as pricey. On $1 night, it is awesome. I love the big roll. If you are a first time Sushi eater, try that one first, it is like a flavor party in your mouth. Anything with crab is easy peasy for a first timer. It was my first one.I slowly ventured into others and now I can eat almost anything and usually love them all. Most of their $1 sushi is delicious. If you are vegetarian, don't run away, their veggie futo roll/vegetarian maki is gross, but get the one you can custom make and have them tempura fry it, they might give u some crap about not being able to tempura fry it but they can and it will be yummy, I guarantee it!They also have tiramisu, which is great because I love it. And a bunch of other fusion dishes for the non-sushi eaters. I don't know why people complain about the decor, despite the glass bricks, it has a pretty cool contemporary/marina style...which kind of makes sense, duh.",

I also hate it when people think that this is the best Sushi place in CU without trying the others.Sushi is expensive. I also understand that not just any restaurant gets access to high quality fish, especially in bumble fuck Chambana. None of these justify the price premium KoFusion demands over the (superior IMHO) Yelowfin, not to mention the also rans Kamakura and Miko. If decor doesn't matter, and cost is an object (when is it not?) Sushi Kame is the best bet.As for their rolls, I do think they can be good. When they are good, they are just as good as the above restaurants. When they are not, they suffer the same perennial complaints for not being well rolled or being skimpy. I have not heard any complaints that their fish was bad, and I grant that this in itself is an accomplishment. The chirashi is reputedly quite good, though I have not had it.Their \"deal night\" is not really a deal. They get you in with the promise of a cheap meal, but the pieces that are $1 each are really tiny. If you are a person who normally orders 2 rolls, you will not be happy with your 10 small (but good) pieces. You will end up ordering an additional roll and maybe more. If that additional roll isn't one of the ones that are in the 10 pieces for $10 deal, prepare to wait for an eternity and a half.",

Their miso soup is excellent, and for desert try the red bean ice cream, sounds strange, but its delicious! They also have a great selection of martinis to pick from. The service is always iffy, but the last couple times we have lucked out with good servers. But either way you can usually find me here on a Sunday or Monday getting my fill of yummy yummy sushi!",

I was fairly impressed at how fresh the fish was, but taken aback by how costly the sushi was.Patrons seemed to mostly be from the university - a bunch of students and some professorial types.

Speaking of chopsticks, our dinner group was all White and then one biracial Asian/White man and he was the only one to automatically be given chopsticks and the rest of us got asked about whether we wanted a western or eastern eating utensil! I could believe it, especially as a race researcher myself. Pretty funny stuff. What if that one biracial Asian guy didn't know how to use chopsticks?? That would have been all kinds of awkward.

There was once that I had the best service of my life, but that was about 4 years ago. Recently I was home and went on a Sunday afternoon. Our waitress was so bad. After we had been seated for 15 min my buddy asked the host if anyone was going to wait on us. A girl came over and flatly took our drink order. After we bagan eating my same buddy had to flag the girl down every time we needed our drinks refilled. Maybe she was having a really bad day in her personal life....because she was not interested in being a waitress whatsoever. The food was good tho. Lol.And while we got shitty service it prompted us to all swap horror stories we've heard about the owner. Seems everyone in town knows someone who worked here for like a day...Or was hired at an interview and never contacted again. And is the owner un aware that the cheap plastic crap in the fish tanks looks like crystal dildos? Everyone I've taken here comments in the penises in the fish tanks.God damn it.....I'll be back....you'll be back......we just love that Big Roll for $1!!!!!!!!",

Great vibe, location, decor, experience, etc. The only downfall is the price tag. Of course, Sunday and Mondays provide the $1 sushi deal. The sushi is good, but sometime it has the tendency of being rather small. If it wasn't for the convenient location and decor, Sushi lovers would probably hit up the other spots are the CU that happen to be a little be further from campus.Overall, cool spot...on Sundays/Mondays.",

HOWEVER, I had a very negative experience tonight and I will not be going back. Let me tell you why. First off, we had waited over an hour for our food and when it arrived it was cold (which we found out after a few bites). We had asked our waiter if he could replace our food with freshly made/hot food. He asked the manager and he said that they were only going to replace what was left on our plate. We understood but wanted to talk to the manager in person about our poor experience thus far. The owner/manager is Janet. As we were talking to her, calmly I might add, she started raising her voice to us and said \"If you don't like it you can leave\". We hadn't done anything wrong and she was literally \"shooing\" us out of the restaurant. We asked if we could talk to another, more reasonable manager. She replied that she was the owner and the only manager. We then asked for her name. She said that she wasn't going to tell us her name!!! After telling us to \"get the hell out\" and threatening to call the police we then asked a waiter for her name. After finding out her name we left. Unsatisfied with just her name and no clue who else we can talk to about this extremely poor service, myself and one of my friends went in to calmly ask the hostess if she knew anyone else we could talk to because obviously Janet was too unreasonable and unprofessional to talk to. She spotted us and continued to yell at us to \"get the hell out\". Even yelling to my female friend that she was disgusting. A male server then proceeded to physically shove us out of the restaurant. Keep in mind, I am never one to be angry or be assertive in these types of situations. However, this was ridiculous! I have no idea how she is a manager of anything!",

I know sushi can be expensive, but I thought it would be something more of \"Chef's Choice\" trying to use up what wasn't purchased over the weekend. You're better off going a different night to avoid the crowds and just order the rolls you like. The rolls themselves were decent, but not the best I've had.",

ONE DOLLAR!  \r\rI've never eaten off the non-sushi menu, but I have had the sake mojito about a million times.  I did not like it as much as a rum mojito at first; not sweet enough, a little sour for a mojito, but it is quite distinctive and grows on me every time I have it.  \r\rThe ambience, I believe, is as good as it gets in champaign.  Nice tranquil water fountains and fish tanks and high def tvs with fishtanks and water fountains playing on them.\r\rService varies.  On one dollar sushi night it (understandably) takes a while for the food to come out, and the politeness of the wait staff during that lengthy interval is not always as high as it might be.",

It's a great way to test out some of their menu options without breaking your bank.The lunch buffet is outstanding- they always offer 3 types of sushi in addition to edamame, spring/egg rolls, rice, and chicken & beef dishes. It's hard to pick what to put on your plate.The specialty cocktails are pretty good too, if a little pricey.Overall, if you get a deal it's worth it, but I've definitely had better sushi.",

The open floor plan, changing lights and fish tanks make this place a fun place to sit and have a meal, too. Our waiter was one of the nicest guys I've talked to in a long time, and he was quick with a refill or a table clear. Also, this place serves a delicious mojito made with sake instead of rum.

The servers are great and the $1 sushi Sunday crowd was huge and happy. Happy? I'd say so! You just can't beat being well fed on fish and having an appetizer and a drink for $20.I looked at their regular sushi menu and was surprised: It is pricy in comparison to SOCAL sushi but I suppose location and limited competition have an impact, so I'll stick to Sundays.

If the place was out of chicken, we didn't have chicken.  No running to the grocery store and lowering quality just to keep it on the menu for the night.  I definitely witnessed a great deal of dedication to the food by the head chef, and if anything makes the place expensive, it's that dedication to always serve the finest ingredients.  That being said, I can only apply that to the kitchen that prepared the entrees, or cooked food.  The sushi obviously must travel some distance to get to Champaign, but the quality is the highest that can be expected that many miles from the ocean.  So if your looking for a place that will prepare simple, elegant meals using top ingredients and organic meat, this is your place.",

They wasted four hours of my time and showed me how not local and not fresh the food is. Really, they aren't unlike many other restaurants now a days. With so many people to feed and pressure to make money, there isn't much choice. I was excited to go to a \"hip\" place and work with sushi, something I'd never done before. But the other employees were hipster-ish and snobby. I go back there because the sushi is enjoyable and my boyfriend likes it. Last time we went (6-6-10) it took us almost 30 minutes just to get our check, because the owner didn't schedule enough people. I'm a waitress; I understand this issue. Naturally, we still tipped our waitress. However, when people come into town, there are many many restaurants I would recommend before KoFusion.",

The menu is interesting, expensive, and not kid friendly, though that appears intentional, since they want big checks, not big families.Veggie option on the menue I had was tofu veggie stirbfry, but when it came, it had zero tofu. strange given the dish was called tofu vegetable stirfry. The waiter never checked in on us after our food arrived until we were finished. He showed me an updated menu in which there was no tofu in the stir fry, too bad I had an old menu - he didn't appologize, just said that he will make sure to remove the old menus from the stack. thanks... My daughter liked the dumplings and california roll. the edamame are served with sesame oil, which is a nice touch.  The waiter refilled my daughter's lemonade with ice water - thanks for that, too....  My son objected when he tried to fill his sprite with water . My son and wife liked the steak. Dessert was good according to my kids though they didn't finish it, so it couldn't have been that good. I've not seen them fail to finish chocolate cake before. In all, it's over priced, decent food with not so great service, but excellent ambiance.  Great for impressing your date, but not necessarily great food or service.",

The atmosphere (which I admittedly can't speak in detail about since we were sitting outside) seemed...I don't know...off. However, by far the worst was the terrible service we received. Maybe he was just having a bad day, but our server really seemed to cop an attitude toward us and took FOREVER tending to our needs. Twice, someone from my party actually had to get up and retrieve him from whatever he was doing so he could actually, you know, do his job. This really should not happen, especially at a place that bills itself as such an upscale, better-than-the-average-restaurant kind of place.This really soured what should have been a great experience. I may give this place another chance some time. However, it'll be a while before I do. I guess if you really have a hankering for sushi, you could do worse.

Finally, before the last time, I asked to have the owner come out, which she did and was somewhat apologetic, but still acted like it was no big deal!I ordered a scallop curry dish. It was strange to say the least, and they cut the scallops in half crosswise! Bizarre, other than they were trying to make it look like my overpriced tiny \"sea\" scallops were worth it. They were the smallest sea scallops I've ever seen. I am from New England, but I am not expecting the same seafood in Illinois, but COME ON! You aren't fooling anyone. I am amazed anyone really thinks this is a 5 star place. It was the worst restaurant experience second only to the time I ate at Miko's...that was worse.",

In addition, one dollar sushi definitely is enticing and worth your money. But if you don't go during one dollar sushi hours, it gets a bit pricey, as it should.

Seafood in the Midwest is absurd to purchase, so I expect it to be a little pricier, but it's fairly comparable. Today, we ordered an app, two bar drinks, three rolls and two desserts and it was $63. Not bad, IMO. I always wish the menu was more descriptive, especially about what sauces come on which rolls. I about burnt my lip off today. The service is hit or miss. Some of the staff behaves a little lofty, but maybe that's what they think people expect. Or maybe some people are just assholes. Anyway...if you're on the fence, go for dollar sushi and give it a try. You can order online, which is sweet. If you call it in, make sure they read it back. So...four stars for a lack of consistency.",

Of course, the waitress suggested dessert.  We passed.The restaurant offers various specials, including an Asian buffet until 1:30 pm on Saturdays.  I would highly recommend finding out what the specials are and planning your visit based on the specials.  The lobster roll WAS really tasty but PASS on the flaming phoenix roll.

It's central Illinois so you can't expect the best raw fish in the world, but Kofusion tends to be overpriced for what you get.  I have a ton of food allergies/triggers so my review now is different than what it would've been 5 years ago.  With sushi I can pretty much just do seaweed, rice, and fish.  I can't do all the extra ingredients that Kofusion tends to overdo.  My favorite is just a plain'ol tuna roll (raw tuna, rice, seaweed).  I got this the other day when I was there and it was like $8 for 6 small pieces.  The worst part?  The fish really wasn't good.  Other places in town are either much cheaper and tastier or they at least charge for the better quality fish. The only other highlight I'd say is that I do like that they serve white ginger and not the pink kind. Bleh.Again, go there if you want to impress someone with the cool ambiance, but the food doesn't support anything more than 3 stars.",

And, I would also ask whether the meat you're ordering is actually organic, because if the restaurant is willing to mislead their customers about the fish, I wouldn't trust them about the meat either! Why anyone would want to patronize a restaurant that has so little respect for the customers that it lies to them about about what's on the menu?",

That doens't say much, however, since Miko's food sucks big time.  I love Ko Fusion sushi - it's creative and the ingredients are top notch.  But seriously, the price is ridiculous considering Sushi Kame makes rolls almost as good for half the price and none of the attitude.  The fish entrees are always good here, but stay away from non-asian dishes - especially pastas or anything Italian.  You would do better with a frozen dinner and I'm not kidding!",

All the food here are up to the standard of authentic, like those I taste in China, not mentioned fresh and clean. All the other restaurants in town offer hot pot could not provide food up to this standard. Based on my personal experiences, I like the tomato soup base. It brings up the flavor in vegetables. Bonus points for the soup tastes after cooking all the meat in there. Hot pot sausage is another dish you must try. The mini eggs taste incredible juicy after cooking in the broth and the egg yolk is very tasteful. I don't eat lamb personally but my friends like it a lot. For the dinning environment, I would say it is good for family, nice for a date and fun for group hang outs. It totally worths for the money you pay for. Servers here are very nice and the manager keep checking on us make sure we had a good time. Anyway, I would say Hot Pot Lab is a fun experience. It would be a good place to treat yourself. :)",

At around 30 dollars a person better food could be eaten elsewhere.",

If you really wanna try authentic Chinese hot pot, maybe little sheep (unfortunately not in Chambana) pricier than AYCE hot pot but really worth the price. Chicagoland AYCE is great as well. Anyway way better than this. ps. me & my bf spent $35 here and we are still hungry. We ordered panda express right after and never though PE could be this delicious and fulfilling.",

                "review": "Ouch, I hate to say this, but Hot Pot Lab isn't as great as when I first came, so I'm taking a star off. For my birthday, I came with a party of four since I was excited to return, and the five us had a fun time with the cooking experience, but otherwise, the service was shoddy. The waitress didn't give us the complimentary edamame appetizer, and she also didn't give us the plate of spices to mix with the sauces. She said Hot Pot Lab stopped doing that because it was a waste of spices to do so. I wish they'd at least put out a second menu of optional spices then. No one wants to eat plain sesame oil!! The waitress also had poor communication with us and we didn't get everything we ordered. We ordered 1 vermicelli and 2 house-made noodle, but we initially only got the house noodles and we had to remind her to get the vermicelli (because she already charged us on the receipt). We noticed they poorly portioned the house-made noodles and one plate definitely had more than the other. Besides that and vegetables (which they also skimped out on making it hard to share), we wanted 2 servings of lamb and 1 beef. Our order came and we only had 1 serving of meat given to us. She said it was lamb. We asked about the other meats, so she went back to the kitchen to look. I think they are either understaffed or the waiters had poor distribution of tables because she went to serve and seat other people and took a while to get back to us. This happened while 2 waiters were chilling around the door next to the kitchen. I felt bad for her! She finally came back to us and profusely apologized, then said they were OUT of lamb. That's fine, but you'd think they'd have a lot of lamb or buy more considering it's a popular item. So what about the beef? Well, it turns out, she said she made a mistake (and you know, didn't tell us), so we were actually eating a plate of beef. That'd be fine, but we had a diner who didn't eat beef - luckily she didn't touch it. At the end, we noticed that she charged us for 1 lamb even though they were out and we didn't even get it. That's a $8 difference! We also noticed she forgot to void the charge for the meatballs (we used a FB deal) and had to tell her. Overall, it came down to $15/person with tip included, so not bad! It's cheaper to buy ingredients from Amko and make your own hot pot, but unless you have your own burner, cooking it on a kitchen stove just isn't hot pot. As usual, the broths are really good and the ingredients are very fresh. I found out the Szechuan Spicy broth (at 2 chili peppers - the scale of hotness is 1-3 peppers) is RIDICULOUSLY SPICY. Like, I wanted to cry because I licked a chopstick dipped in it and it burned so much. Even the steam emanating from the pot is intense. If you really like feeling the burn, get this! Vegetarian note: ALL THE BROTHS ARE MADE WITH PORK BONES. They do offer specially made vegetarian-friendly broths (based from a normal water base with the spices added), so ask your server for that!Side note: they have a deal where if you show the waiter you liked their FB page and checked in on FB, they give you a free side of meatballs of your choice! Limited time only.",

Before I check out this restaurant, I'm a little bit worried about the price as I have seen few yelpers give this restaurants low marks due to the price things. However, I don't think myself has overpaid a lot for the great environment, helpful server, and fine plates after I tried out this great place. Personally, I have visited a bunch of hot pot restaurants both in CU area and Chicago. Although they may have a lower price at this point, I have to say that the preparation of raw materials is in an extremely rough way with the 'sliced' meat piled together. Also, I'm tired of grabbing food from one large pot, and really enjoying the individual pot. For those who has underrated this fine place, I'd suggest to take the dining environment and the great taste into consideration. It's really worth trying out and I'll definitely come back again.",

I initially ordered the mild broth, but switched after trying the spicy (the server was really nice about the switch). It wasn't long after we put in our order we were able to eat. So much food we actually over ordered, so I would suggest ordering a few things and adding on as you eat. We got the meat lovers and instead of lamb and beef we got double beef (again server was okay with this as well). The white shrimp paste was so good!! Good thing we didn't have to eat right out of the pots as it was very hot, temperature wise. I had to cool my food on the plates provided. The service was great and they were all more than willing to help us with anything we needed.  Will definitely be my go to hot pot spot!",

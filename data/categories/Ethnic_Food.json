At first, I was nervous bringing my kids grocery shopping with me since the aisles are a little tight and everything is so neatly stacked and organized. My biggest fear was my kiddos knocking things down. The carts are small otherwise I would have put both of them in there to contain them. My worries soon disappeared when a lady working behind the counter engaged my toddlers in a conversation while I quickly found the items I was looking for. The staff is friendly and welcoming and there is a great selection of goods.",

They also have a good selection of local foods from nearby farms and bakeries. Prices are far more reasonable than big stores like Cost Plus World Market or similar Chicago stores.

They have some cool Islamic items like tooth cleaning materials made from traditional miswak, fancy imported dates, and Arab keffiyeh scarves.

Also, check expiration dates.  I forgot to do so last time I shopped here, and ended up with some lovely stale food.  I do like to stop here and buy a few things as an occasional indulgence, but in general it's just too expensive.Their halva is fantastic, though--seriously, the best.",

I'm a snob.  Because I want more.  I'd like a bigger cheese selection with more of a display and some fois gras.  Not that kibbi isn't also excellent, but I'd like you to indulge my stuffwhitepeoplelike attitude just a tad bit more please.  The store could also stand to have a couple hundred more square feet, perhaps filled with a nice wine selection.  There really aren't enough places to buy a decent Malbec in this town, maybe this place could be one?All in all, an excellent establishment that I will never be able to just walk past.

My only critique would be that the Asian goods and foods are waaay overpriced. If you're willing to dig around a bit, there are some great Asian food stores in the area, like Am-Ko, Green Onion and Far East.

Based on other reviews, we stopped through to pick up lunch.  What an unfortunate mistake for us.  The menu features fairly-priced Mediterranean foods that sounded great.  We ordered the baba ganoush and falafel sandwiches and a vegetarian platter.  The falafel was microwaved and lost any texture it might have had when first prepared.  It had no distinguishable flavor.  The baba was so smoky, that I couldn't finish the sandwich.  Three bites overwhelmed my palette completely.  We had already purchased the dessert and gave them a shot, because they were aesthetically very pleasing.  Unfortunately, the birds nest was soft (so sad) and the date cookie was crumbled and poorly prepared.  I've never thrown away so much food.  Maybe we came on an off day, but based on our experience, my recommendation is to shut it down.  You've got a great store, why compromise your credibility with this food?",

They have Castelvetrano olives, which I thought would be impossible to find in CU.  Lots of delicious cheeses, which they will always let you try before you buy.  Sometimes they give away free chocolate!  What more could you want?",

The have a whole aisle just of tea. Both sides! And two end caps! There were so many brands and kinds that I had to remind myself that I can definitely come back, and no need to buy all the tea. The price ranged from $4-$8 for a box of 20 bags of tea. They had bulk tea, and about 8 specific tea flavors (not brands) were on sale. Unfortunately, none of those appealed to me, but I'll check back again!The owner is so nice! He chatted me up, asked me what I was studying, if I'm new to the area. Definitely made me feel welcome.",

I've been in town for 4 years and just discovered World Harvest.The owner and staff are very welcoming and helpful, which shows that they take pride in their business.  There is a very extensive selection of food from all over the world, with a delicious looking deli/cheese selection as well.  I was able to find an Eastern European bread that I've been looking for, a great looking frozen Indian dish, and my favorite French biscuits, all in one trip.  Unlike some other places, this store is clean and well organized.  I really look forward to coming back again.",

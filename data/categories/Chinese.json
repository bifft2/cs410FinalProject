It is in the same price-range as Golden Harbor (which I love), but in my opinion the food here is even better.We were a party of 13, and were seated comfortably in the large table in the side room. The owner of the place took our orders, and she was wonderfully fun/sassy about it. She gave great recommendations, and would tell us if she thought we were making an unsuitable selection.Cuisine highlights:- GARLIC SAUCE, anything in garlic sauce was delicious (beef, eggplant, etc)- Beijing duck (wraps had good texture, duck was cooked well, good sauces)- Crispy tofu (crispier coating than from Golden Harbor)- Fish with pine nuts (fish was battered and fried, and drizzled with a sweet sauce)- Steamed tilapia (very tender)- Scallion pancakes (owner served us two orders for free)- Kung Pao Tofu (all-around delicious)I had been skeptical of the place because of its location in the eerily-deserted Lincoln Square mall, but they renovated the place a few months back, and the ambience is great!My only regret is, having gone away, I can't partake in this sumptuousness anymore :(",

The whole plate was filled with white rice, with very little veggies and chicken (perhaps 2-3 spoons). I just had to eat dry rice, which were also overcooked. It seemed the management is trying to save costs by cutting the portion size, while charging the same price. Next time I will pay more at a different restaurant, which does not try to compromise with quality and portion size. I was so unhappy with their service that I did not pay tip. But later I saw that they added $1.00 to what I had signed on the receipt.",

The duck was good though the \"pancakes\" were cold. The spinach was acceptable (and looked like a popular dish, considering how many other tables were ordering it). But the best thing hands down was the eggplant dish, which had the best sauce I think I have ever tasted. You will like eggplant after trying this dish! There was plenty of food for all of us, and we even took some home afterward; the vegetable dishes are large portions. Price was totally reasonable. Only real complaints are that the \"hot\" tea was barely warm, and that we had to flag down our waiter to bring the check, even though we'd been sitting over empty plates for quite a while.",

Variety of Americanized Chinese food, including the all-mighty general cao's chicken, plus lunch special.3. Deserts and snack-sized dishes () are beyond comparable in CU area.4. The ONLY restaurant that opens late-night which serves authentic Chinese food rather than fast food.5. Services are above average.Cons:1. Above averagely pricy. Usually $2-$4 more expensive then similar dishes served elsewhere in CU.2. Delivery may be slow during busy hours (~40mins to ~1hour). 3. 15% tip is enforced on Chinese customers, due to their tendency to tip waiters inappropriately or not tipping at all. But if you look like a gentlemen/lady who appreciates the service of others then they won't enforce anything on you, liberty of tipping is all yours.In general, this is a great place to come if: you like real Chinese food or quality Americanized Chinese food, enjoys above average food and services, and willing to pay for the food and service. This is not a good place to come if: you would prefer to save up a little money and settle for okay food (Panda Express is always an option, right? lol), or your meal budget doesn't include tips like it is for most cheaper Chinese places.Hope this helps.",

Correction: Golden Wok has the best pad thai EVER.  And yes, this is comparing it against not only the local places, but also every thai restaurant I've ever been to, and I've been to plenty.  The reason why their pad thai is so good is because of the flavoring: A lot of other Thai places either don't have enough of it, or they have so much that it's overly sweet and/or salty and it becomes so cloying I can't ever bear to finish it.  Golden Wok's pad thai, on the other hand, is done so well I finished it very quickly in one sitting...and as others have said, their portions are VERY generous.  Besides the flavor, the noodles are also done well, not mushy and stuck together, and not undercooked, and overall the dish isn't too oily either.  Four stars for the delicious pad thai all on its own; I haven't tried anything else there but we'll see how that goes...like I said, I usually stay away from \"chinese/thai\" places, but I feel like Golden Wok has earned my respect, if nothing else for their pad thai.They have their own lot, so parking isn't as bad as it is on campus.  Look out for the small yellowish standalone building; it's easy to drive past it.",

It doesn't get a huge amount of foot traffic through it and is located on the border of one of the sketchier areas in Champaign, but the food is good for what you pay for. A typical entree might be $8-9 (which is expensive for Champaign IMO). But you also do get lots of food. My favorite dish here is Beef Pad See Ewe which is the long noodles with broccoli, bok choy, and beef. Put a little siracha sauce on it and you have a really tasty dish.The restaurant is family owned and they seem to be there all the time. They are really good about phone orders and being fairly quick about bringing dishes out, though sometimes they might forget something. You just have to have thick skin when going into the place, because you might not get the best service.The downside of this place is that it just seems a little bit dirty. The tables are a bit grimey even after they wipe them down. And you have to clean up everything yourself. But the family is super nice and the food is good and there really is no Thai place like it in the Champaign-Urbana area.Other popular dishes I see people get are:Pad ThaiRed CurryGreen CurryI give it 3.5 stars, but not enough to round up to 4 on the food alone.",

I remember eating here my freshman year when my cousin brought me here.  I had a craving for some pad thai, so I decided to come here again.  Ordered an order of shrimp pad thai.  I usually order beef pad thai wherever I go, but I decided I would try something different.  Very large portion, easily enough for two meals.  Great flavors as well.  My only gripe is that they left the tails on the shrimp, so I was faced with the option of picking them off, which is a pain or just eating the tails on.  I went with the latter, which wasn't a big issue, but still undesirable.  Next time I'll be ordering beef pad thai.",

I was even more suspicious of their advertisement of combined Thai and Chinese cooking.  However, as I passed by one day, I noticed that the outside window declared that they served Hainan chicken rice, a traditional delicacy rarely mentioned outside of larger urban areas.  I gave it a try, and now I swear by Golden Wok for my Thai cravings.Champaign diners go nuts for the pad thai here.  I'm also a fan of this popular noodle dish, but for my review, I'd like to pay homage to another favorite dish from this modest little store: the tom kha kai.The tom kha kai soup comes in generous portions, with lots of chicken, soft mushrooms, bright chili flakes, slices of scallion, and a few pieces of ginger and lemongrass (shouldn't eat those last two, but at least they're testaments to the broth's beautiful flavor).  Soups at Golden Wok are spooned over jasmine rice instead of noodles.  This dish easily served as 3 meals for me, and is irresistible given its price ($7.35).",

Anyway, my order came very fast, within a few minutes. The veggie and sauce mix was really tasty, but the meat (I ordered a chicken dish) was not too good.  In fact, it tasted like turkey.  I probably will not go here again.  Also, the workers have a hard time speaking English. It was hard to understand them, and I was note sure my order was being communicated correctly to them.

So far I've had their Pad Thai, Pad Kee Mow, Pad Prig Pow (not sure on this name), and Ho Fun and they were better than anything you can find in Champaign-Urbana. That's not saying a whole lot, but their Ho Fun is one of my favorite things to get when I eat out. Their curries are also pretty phenomenal, the meat quality isn't too great, you can tell that they buy their meat (except maybe for the duck) from the big commercial vendors but the curry itself is exceptional. If you do decide to go with the curry I'd recommend the Panang as it's not loaded with vegetables as the other variations tend to be.The Thai iced tea is also quite good. Thai iced tea is one of those things that's almost guaranteed to be good anywhere you get it, but as Christina F. puts it, it's well worth the $2.10 if you want a nice sweet closer on your meal. Their lunch specials however are a little less desirable, as it's pretty much the same as every other Chinese lunch special in town with the staple Beef with Broccoli, Shrimp in Lobster Sauce, Sweet and Sour Chicken and the like, and it's honestly not very good. I've personally tried two or three chicken dishes for the lunch special decidedly giving the Wok another chance for redemption after each subsequently disappointing meal, but they failed to deliver, each dish being pretty much the same as the last but in a different sauce.I also have to agree with the 2-star review that's also up here. The Tom Yum Khai wasn't very good when I had it. I ordered the Shrimp Tom Yum Khai and it tasted overpoweringly like shrimp and mushrooms, you could barely taste the broth under the taste of these two ingredients.Overall though, I'm willing to give Wok 4 stars because if you know what to order, you're almost guaranteed to get a good and tasty meal.",

It was a scene worthy of a movie - dramatic music, slow-mo closeups of pad thai flying everywhere, and fat tears of epiphany rolling down my cheeks to salt up my food. Not that the food needed any more salt or additional seasoning anyway. In direct contrast to the squat (one could even go so far as to call it ugly) exterior, the dishes are pure decadence in your mouth. Yes, the pad thai is awesome but people, let's stroll down some paths less taken, shall we? Pad see ew is also good, though in my opinion, perhaps a bit too much sauce. My favorites would have to be the Golden Fried Rice (offered only on their Shining White Board of Specials) and the Beef Noodle Soup. The Golden Fried Rice is curried, pineappled, raisined, egged goodness. Sounds weird but the lesson here is \"never judge a book by its cover\", remember? The Beef Noodle Soup is perhaps a direct cousin of Vietnamese pho. I've never been quite sure whether to go ahead and give it the pho label because it just never seems quite..... pho-y enough. But irregardless of labels, its exactly what I find myself ordering when it's blizzarding and I just want some hot broth and flavorful noodles to fill me up. The curries are also excellent. Hell, just go ahead and order everything. I'm pretty sure you can't lose.Could it get any better? Why yes, it can, rhetorical question asker. With giant portion sizes! Unless you're of the same breed as some of my male bottomless-pit friends, be prepared for leftovers. Advice: noobs should go with an experienced G-Woker. It's a hidden gem - emphasis on hidden.",

I can usually eat it for lunch and still have more than enough for dinner. Their Thai Iced tea is also worth the $2.10 price. The food also comes out pretty fast. Try to stop by during their lunch specials. It's an entree, fried rice, and an eggroll. Their fried rice is ridiculously good and their eggroll is perfect... they're stuffed with noodles inside.",

Though I do like the pad thai more than the duck fried rice, I feel that this deserves some special mentioning.  It is delicious and is one of the best fried rice dishes that I've ever had.  They pretty much took the chopped up roast duck that you'd typically find at Chinese stores and made fried rice with it.  All the duck grease melds with the rice and it is awesome.  Oh yeah, being chopped up means that there's bone in there too... to be careful about that.Regardless, this is yet another must visit if you're in this area.",

Pretty authentic, given they use several authentic ingredients, including the green gourd-like vegetables in the stock. Great food, great price, not so great location.",

The filling that we could taste in the rangoon was, at best, ok. It might have been better, but the outside was so gross that we didn't taste the filling too much. My wife spit it out in her napkin (she never does this). Not again.",

I went with the Singapore special, spicy curry chicken with onions. To treat myself I ordered an eggroll and also hot and sour soup.When the delivery came 40 minutes later, I was surprised that the eggroll did NOT have the typical packets of sweet sauce or mustard sauce, the chopsticks that I asked for in my special request were NOT delivered, and the spicy curry chicken with onions was approximately 12 ounces of brown sauce with some chicken parts in it that appeared to have been smashed with a sledgehammer.There was no rice provided and there are no other vegetables in the dish other than approximately six rings of a sliced onion swimming in brown oil.The chicken was skin and fat included. Bones were included as well, although they had carefully smashed each bone so that it was in multiple shards with sharp edges.This may be the quintessential way that Singapore special spicy curry chicken with onions is served.So shame on me if I just was not familiar with the dish. A little rice on the side would have been a nice treat.The hot & sour soup was neither better nor worse than any other hot and sour soup I've had from any other Asian restaurant in Champaign.",

This place is really easy to miss because it is a tiny building that does not look anything like a Thai restaurant.The restaurant was completely empty when we got there but while we were eating there was a steady stream of people coming in to order take out. We ordered the Tom Yun Koong, Yum Nuau, and Jungle Curry.Tom Yun Koong is a soup that is exactly the same as the traditional Tom Yum soup found at all Thai restaurants and it came with shrimp.  The soup was delicious, but definitely not the best I have ever had. It had the prefect amount of heat, the shrimp were not overcooked, and the vegetables were nice and crispy.Yum Nuau is a spicy beef salad. I always order this dish when i go to a Thai restaurant and I have to admit that this salad had some sort of different spice which was very tasty. Again, it was not the best I have ever had but it was deliciously unique. All the vegetables in the salad were super fresh and the quality of the beef was excellent. Jungle Curry was very confusing though. It came in a big bowl with a ton of fresh vegetables and wonderfully seasoned chicken but the sauce was some sort of chicken broth with seasonings. I thought that they brought me the wrong dish but sure enough it was the Jungle \"curry\" that I had ordered. This was the first time I was served a curry dish which did not consist of coconut milk. It was very tasty though and I was not disappointed that I ordered it. In the future I will definitely always ask for the ingredients in the dish before I order it.  One other complaint was that the menus are very simple and do not have pictures or any sort of description of the dishes. This would be nice but not a big huge deal.The service was excellent and the people working there are very friendly.I would definitely recommend this place.",

The online ordering was not working so I called and was pleasantly surprised to speak with someone who was able to take my order in coherent English, as this has always been an age-old problem ordering Chinese food over the phone.Delivery time was ~45 minutes, which seems to be the standard in Champaign-Urbana, no complaints there.We ordered Chicken Yi Mein and Sweet & Sour Chicken with a side of egg roll and egg drop soup. My Yi Mein was just fair, the thin noodles were interesting but overall I thought it was bland. It looked like the sauce had pooled up at the bottom and it was almost all liquid. The quantity of chicken to vegetables to noodles was also kind of unbalanced, I thought. My friend's sweet and sour chicken was much more flavorful and tasty than my dish, I probably should have ordered that. He also liked the egg-drop soup.However, the reason for only 2 stars comes from the egg roll. My friend found a very small chunk of what he believed to be plastic inside the egg roll. We tried really hard to identify the object but gave up out of disgust. I don't think there's anything that justifies this, and coupled with my underwhelming Yi Mein, I probably would not order from here again.",

And given the intense competition among Chinese restaurants in Champaign, I think it was a smart business tactic for Chopstix to exploit the late night market.  Chopstix delivers food until around 3:00 a.m. each night; the trade-off is that they don't open until 4:00 p.m.The actual storefront is just a counter with 3 tables (not really an invitation to stay and eat), but the service is friendly and enthusiastic.As for the menu, you'll find all those greasy Americanized-Chinese standards: lo mein, fried rice, and combo platters (entree, rice, and egg roll).  You'll need a gallon of water to offset the astronomical salt content of the food, but nobody eats at a place like this without expecting to do so.I ordered shrimp egg foo young, and the quality was above average.  The egg patties were an equal mix of meat and sliced vegetables (onions and nappa), with the edges crisp from frying.  I liked that the vegetables still had some substance and texture, and that the sauce wasn't a heavy, sluggish gravy.  Some bright green onions were even sprinkled on top to offer color to a usually drab plate of food.Overall, a welcome addition to the late night eateries in Champaign, especially as the food is really pretty decent.",

I have never in my life been treated with such customer service, and the owners never acted as though they were \"pretending\" to be nice in order to gain popularity.Every time I go in, I am treated like family, and Chopstix ALWAYS satisfies my chinese food cravings!!! Prices are extraordinarily cheap-- you can easily get two meals out of one order (their portions are huge!!) and not pay more than $8.I can't say enough great things about this restaurant- the owners really know what they are doing!!!",

I've called 6 times & they both hung up on me.The lady also told me if I kept complaining she would call the cops on me. Wtf calls the cops on customers who don't like their food?

I mean, these wontons are massive, but had the same amount of meat as a wee-wonton.  The broth was nearly tasteless.We also shared the Szechuan pork which came in a huge portion, but really tasted like veggies and a little pork with teriyaki sauce.  Still, not expensive, huge portions, open late.",

Today I ordered Sesame Chicken, and I was only able to eat about half of it. The rest of the chicken was really tough, and contained cuts of meat that just aren't fit for consumption. Delivery times aren't so great either. It took a good 40-45 minutes for this past order around 9pm during winter break, so they can't be too busy. I don't think I'll be ordering from Chopstix again.",

You can sub the egg roll for wonton soup for 85 cents, so I did.

They immediately denied that this was possible and told us that it must have been one of our staples (which had miraculously inserted itself into a piece of chicken in a sealed plastic container on the drive home). They demanded that we send a picture of the staple to their cellular phone number.  We did so immediately, within seconds of the requrest.  The owner got onto the phone and claimed that the staple could not possibly be one of theirs because it was \"curved\" differently.  My friend attempted to explain that this was impossible, but was screamed at by the owner and his wife.  The owner then told her that she would get \"IN TROUBLE\" if she reported this.

So I wondered how they would be able to compete.Here's how. They deliver and they deliver late. If you want food at like 1 am, they'll bring it to you. I don't think any of the other ones do. And this place has cheap prices for pretty decent food. It's not like authentic authentic but it gets the job done. And it's still more Chinese than panda express. I always get the crab ragoons. I like how it's not traditional and they roll them differently. And the beef and broccoli is always a good choice. pay cash and they give you like a 30 cent discount too!",

My roommate has been ordering food there a couple of times and encouraged me to try it. The menu is like any other chinese restaurant: soup, appetizer, poultry, fried rice, etc. The girl who picked up the phone was very nice. I ordered the General Tso's Chicken entree which included a side of whtie rice and was priced $9.05. A lot of the entrees are p riced between $8-9 which isn't too bad. It's on the border of pricey, however, I don't mind paying this much from Chopstix. They have a combo platter which I wouldn't recommend ordering. The combo platter is priced between $7-$7.50 and is a smaller portion than the entree. It is served with steamed white rice or fried rice with a choice of either egg roll or spring roll. The portion is too small and they don't give you enough meat in the combo platter. In addition, the egg roll isn't that great. However, my General Tso Chicken entree came in a timely manner. It was hot and fresh. The delivery guy was very polite and I gave him a $2 tip. On the side note, I just found out that they will charge a $1.50 delivery fee if your order is $15.00... oh well. I'm excited that they're open till 3AM which I need to take advantage of in the future. Anyways, I would recommend ordering at Chopstix again. Thank you, roomie for this awesome recommendation.",

I've only ever ordered delivery so I don't know how the in-house service is, but the delivery drivers are always really nice and polite. The food is delicious (the crab rangoons are HUGE and a little sweet which is my favorite) and the dumplings are the best I've ever had. Pretty much everything I've ordered from Chopsticks has been delicious. Best part? They're open super late. I honestly don't know why anyone would eat at any other Chinese place on campus.",

What I will say is that their service is amazing and since they are the only late night Chinese restaurant around (especially with delivery) when it's necessary they are tops!I've come to realize, it's acutally pretty decent food.  You can't go wrong with General Tso's or Orange Chicken.  My friend likes their fried dumplings and their Wonton Soup is good.  What you'll notice is every time you come in, regardless of it's your first or second time, they'll always greet you with a smile and take care of you.  There's a sweet girl who works in there, who I swear must be on pills because she is always happy and super nice to you.  It's mainly a take-out and delivery place, but you can eat there.  When you eat there, they'll serve you water and bring you napkins and such, but it's not really an eat-in place.  There's a 3% discount if you pay cash.Being on a college campus, we all get interesting cravings for interesting things throughout the night.  Chopstix is currently the only restaurant I know of that does both take-out and delivery until at least 3:00am.  By the way, delivery is relatively quick.  Just try it out, it's pretty good.",

I've experienced both unnecessarily authentic Chinese cuisine and hyper-Americanized Chinese food and I will go for something in-between every time.So this place seems like it will fit right in with that, but it doesn't. The service blows, they have a $7 minimum charge for credit/debit cards - when I told them that was not allowed withiin their contracts with the credit card companies they gave me a blank stare, I walked out.The couple of times I have eaten here I was not even mildly enthused about anything - the fried rice has no soy sauce flavor, or any particular flavor at all, it reminds me of those microwaveable rice cups. The meat was chewy and decently flavored but the portion was pretty small- not worth the price.Don't worry, there's about 15,000 Asian restaurants on Green St - I'm sure that you'll find something...",

Probably the cheapest on campus - especially for the quantity you get for your money. Each time we order delivery it lasts at least 3 meals. That said, their dishes are hit and miss. Some of the ones we have enjoyed immensely were Sweet and Sour Fish (), Fish with Garlic Sauce (), Eggplant with Garlic Sauce (). In general, the Chinese menu items (House Specialty/Szechuan) have been awesome. One time, though, we ordered the Lemon Chicken. It came in a box with lumps of fried chicken and a gelatinous yellow sauce to pour over it.",

However, since they've hired a new chef, they put on more pretensions now, they have some alleged \"Szechuan\" dishes, which are quite a bit more expensive, yet EVEN WORSE than the regular dishes. The \"new chef\" is worse than the traditional chefs I've seen there for years. I tried two different dishes from the more expensive menu, some beef which was edible but undermediocre, and then a whole \"Szechuan bean chili whole fish\" dish which was so bad and literally stinky I couldn't finish it. (I should mention I love Chinese food and I had lots of it, in lots of places.) The reason I still visit the place, rarely, is a cheapish and tasty Crispy Whole Fish, in the regular menu, which is not authentic Chinese, but which for some reason I crave every three months.The campus Chinese place to go is Lai-Lai, period. There's simply no comparison in quality, and when the ratio price/quantity/quality satisfaction is being taken into account, Lai-Lai offers by far the best deal on campus. Compared to Empire Chinese, Evo (where the chef comes out of the toilet and back into the kitchen, without washing his hands), or even Mandarin Wok, which has some OK dishes, but not equal to Lai-Lai.",

Sprinkled between the overly large vegetable pieces were slim strips of pork that were barely seasoned and covered with again, the run of the mill brown gravy that they probably smother every beef or pork dish they make, the worst part of which was that it was bland and tasted vaguely of corn-starch thickened soy. And last but not least, the dish came with a choice of white or \"fried\" rice. I opted for the fried rice which looked and tasted almost identical to what I imagine their white rice would have tasted like except that it was tinged yellow.  It looked like the stuff that comes out of a box of Uncle Ben's, except I'd pay for Uncle Ben's.I can't believe there are so many positive reviews of this place. Granted there aren't very many good 4+ star-worthy places on Green St., but I'm led to believe that most of these people have never had really good Chinese food and stick to their staples of Orange or General Tso's chicken, or some variation on fried chicken bits in a sweet sauce. If you're looking for a good place near Green St., try Evo's on Sixth south of Green or if you're willing to walk the extra six or so blocks, head over to Golden Wok on University and Fourth.Never ordering from this place again.",

Although, I will admit that I haven't eaten at every place around town, there aren't too many great Chinese restaurants around here (this does not include buffets).  Their General Tso's chicken is amazing.  Giant quantities for prices a bit on the high side, but not too bad considering how much you get.  Anything bigger than a small and you're guaranteed to take it home in a doggie bag tray thingy (are the trays seriously called doggie bags, too?) unless you're sharing it with someone else.  I usually only order the General Tso's or Vegetable Lo Mein (my default Chinese food preferences), so I can't really say much about the rest of the menu, but I did order soup there once and they gave me it in a giant bowl, with a decent amount of noodles.  It tasted okay, but not great.  It can get kind of crowded in there with limited seating and the atmosphere isn't too great, but it's acceptable.",

I probably wouldn't opt for the Revolution items if I was not sick or dieting, but they are a great option.",

Should've tried the dumplings myself; was all set to do so after reading reviews here.  But I wasn't in the mood for meat. So...I got the veggie lo mein.  It's not a difficult dish, and I've pretty much never gotten a bad version.  Until here!  Bland, boring, and worst of all, super greasy.  It felt like oil slicks in my mouth.  Arrgh.  Why?  It was like being served greasy coffee- one of those things that totally mystify and leave you wondering what the hell the chef was up to back there.",

Pros: Friendly service, order was ready pretty quickly, meals were cheap (plenty of food for three people for 13 and change), walls were freshly painted in bright colors, napkins, sauces, forks, etc were fully-stocked and clean.Cons: Decor was sort of confusing and borderline gross. We wondered what had been living in the empty fishtank near the door. Mix of Chinese language and Champaign newspapers scattered all around the seating area, walls postered in a million different menu items. The biggest con, however? The food. My friends got sweet and sour chicken. They said it was alright. The fried rice was BRIGHT yellow - almost saffron-y in color. Unnatural. The egg roll was disappointing. I had the pork with 'string beans,' a.k.a. green beans and white rice. The pork wasn't terrible, and the beans were passable, but it was all covered in this hideous teriyaki/shoyu sauce. There was SO much MSG that I ended up with a horrible migraine later in the evening. I anticipate that any (especially cheap) Chinese food in the area will contain at least some MSG, but this was just over the top. Considering the number of good-to-amazing Chinese restaurants within a 2 mile radius of campus (Golden Harbor, Lai Lai Wok, Rainbow Garden, etc), I won't be going back to Empire.",

It's also inexpensive, well-lit, and the people who work here are incredibly sweet. They also offer free hot tea and water during your meal.

The orange chicken was really dry and the fried rice is like plain yellow rice, doesn't even have any vegetables or that brown tint or any chicken in it or anything at all. The egg roll was absolutely disgusting that came with the meal. My theory is that maybe I ordered the food too late, as it was about 9 PM and maybe the food got nasty over the day and not fresh. But seriously that was the worst Chinese food, (even the Chinese food in UIUC dining halls is better, not by a lot, but better)--- and that is saying something, that I have ever had. Oh yeah the delivery guy spoke no English at all which is kind of annoying if you want to pick up the food. The main person taking the order also was terrible at English which did not help when I wanted to substitute the egg roll for crab rangoon, which most places let you do. But seriously the fried rice was not even fried, it was all caked up as if it was terribly cooked. Did I mention $10 for this kind of combo is pricey for a Chinese place. I have had MUCH MUCH better quality meal combo (larger size as well) of Chinese food for such a price. The chicken was literally all dry and stale tasting. Most disappointing Chinese food of my life.",

Run by the former owner of T'ang Dynasty and possibly as good as Golden Harbor.  We had eggplant with ground pork, cold noodles (spicy with ginger and chile), cold salty Nanking duck, and fried spring rolls.  All was delicious, especially the eggplant and the duck.  And there's plenty more on the menu to explore.This place has been open in the old Fireside/Rocks/Boneyard BBQ building across from Mas Amigos since late December, so, yes, the interior is pretty much just the bare bones of a bar and grill right now, but much less spartan than Golden Harbor's lunchroom ambience, if that kind of thing is important to you.  Go give them some business!",

This place was previously the Boneyard Bar & BBQ and you can tell that because there is a bar area in the middle. They have fresh lobster and tilapia in the tank so thats a good thing. They are newly open so the menu is still kinda unofficial and it can sure use some remodeling and decoration to make it more like a Chinese restaurant but overall its not a bad place to dine.Based on their menu, they can cook some big dishes like dongpo pork hock but we tried something basic. Food is nicely cooked and relatively authentic (they have american chinese food too). Price is medium ($$).4 stars for the food2.5 stars for the environment but things may turn better with running",

For me, South China is in the middle of the pack -- not as fancy as Rainbow Garden or as tasty as Golden Harbor, but somewhere inbetween. The big plus of this restaurant is the spacious interior and decent size parking lot but the dishes are a little on the expensive side and the service could be quicker. Food is inconsistent with some dishes being excellently prepared while others are bland and forgetful.  In particular, I liked the Deep Fried Fish Fillet with Pine Nuts & Sweet & Sour Sauce, Sauteed Asparagus & Shredded Pork, Braised Pork, Mao's Family Style, and Stewed Meatball With Brown Sauce in Hot Pot.",

They have a live fish tank in the front lobby, a big rock (to rub for luck...leftover from when the restaurant was \"The Rock\"), a bar and a huge dining area.   Their menu is very extensive with seafood, pork, poultry, beef, vegetables, etc.  I walked in around 11am and the restaurant was empty.  It was VERY cold so I wound up keeping my jacket on.  I ordered from their lunch menu ($6.95!) and wound up getting the Hong Shiao Fish fillets.  It comes with a choice of soup (hot sour or egg drop) or salad, an egg roll or crab rangoon, and white or fried rice.   I chose hot and sour, egg roll and white rice.  Everything came out FAST.  The egg roll had lots of pork in it with cabbage, the hot sour soup was hot and yummy.  And the entree was wonderful!!! They do have the American lunches (moo gai pan, kung pao chicken, etc) but I tried to get something that I never had before.  There were lots of bell peppers, snap peas, onions, mushrooms and flaky white fish.  The sauce wasn't typical... it was a welcome flavor of sweet and savory!!!   Anyway, I enjoyed it for being a fast Chinese lunch... and the price and service were great!   I'll definitely return!!!",

We ordered three dishes (one appetizer) and all were well seasoned and pretty authentically Chinese.  My favorite was the Water Boiled Beef ()--spicy and numbing from the peppercorns, with yummy veggies at the bottom.  We were fishing around at the end for every last morsel! The appetizer we ordered () was a good mix of beef + tendon + offal, rather than being heavy on one vs the others.  The interior is interesting, harkening a bit back to the bar setup from the sports bar that used to inhabit the space.  In general, the food was solid and the service helpful.  Check them out if you're interested in a more authentic Chinese place.",

The dough covering was not thin but with firm and chewy texture. The filling came to your bite with some surprisingly pleasant fragrance. Okay, i am not from the northern part of China where people make this type of dumplings from scratch at home in a daily basis or so. But after 4 years living in Beijing, to the dumpling and the owner, i say, Bravo.And there comes some serious culinary work. We hadAppetizers:Chengdu Clear NoodlesScallion PancakesMain courses:Braised Duck with ScallionFire Pot with Pork Intestine and Hot SauceSteam Fish with Pickled Peppers in Hunan Style (Celery Fried with Dry Tofu and Peppers (The Braised Duck with Scallion and the Steam Fish with Pickled Peppers in Hunan Style ( were really the highlights. The duck was tender with a source surprises you mouth full. The fish was just so gentle cooked that you feel it softened your teeth and tongue.Our Russian American friends have been exposed to some fine Chinese cuisines both in Chicago and China (mainland and HK) as well as fine cuisines everywhere so I will say gourmet tourists. They enjoyed the two dishes very much as us Chinese did.  Okay, in a nutshell, write down my list in Chinese or English, one way or another. This is the \"You have to know what to order\" list. Try it out there and you will never regret.",

Then we had to wait over 30 min to finally have our food come. Other tables came way after us with bigger groups as well but they received all of their food and we always had to keep asking the waitresses when our food was coming or for simple refills of drinks and rice. Food is great but service sucked, they should have better management on their staff since they were understaffed and the waitresses kept forgetting to give us our utensils and such and we always had to repeatedly remind them to serve us things properly. Restaurant wasn't even that crowded but other Chinese people were served with lots of food and great service except for us. (We had a group of american, and vietnamese people) I don't recommend coming here unless you have a lot of patience for food to come over 30 min and that you're Chinese.",

If you ever wonder what happened to the food there, it was this: the cook sold it and left. He's now opened a new place and the food's just as good as I remembered it. Had the dry-fried string beans, some stir-fried beef and mixed veg dish, the mix platter appetizer and some beef noodle soup. All were quite flavorful and tasty, and not too oily (something that happens often in this town with Chinese food, sadly). Could not stop eating the green beans, even my four year old liked them. For those who use this metric for their Chinese restaurants: every other patron there was native Chinese, both students and older folk. Parking is free, easy and plentiful. As others have said, the interior is the exact same (they even still have the beanbag toss game out on the patio and the 'lucky' rock in the lobby from when it was Rock's) just with a bunch of tables thrown in but I'm sure that'll change as it gets established.The serving staff was efficient (might have to point at the menu item you're ordering) and quick with the food, which was piping hot and obviously freshly made, and quite friendly with my son when he practiced his Chinese on them. All in all a nice time, excellent authentic food, easy parking close to campus and convenient hours. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.",

We both left full and with enough leftovers for another meal (which we ate the next night). The Bad:-The service wasn't fantastic. Sometimes a bit slow, but there was one waitress for the entire dining room of 10-15 tables, so it was completely understandable. Overall:I would definitely return, the food was very good, though I wish they delivered!",

They're just happy people, and happy people make great food.FYI: Whilst observing the magic behind the curtain one day, I did see them cooking the vegetables by blanching them in a deep fat fryer along with the egg rolls. -- And that's why Chinese food tastes good, folks!",

The owners are extremely nice and accommodating and best of all, the food is very inexpensive. Every time family comes into town or I have friends over, we make our way to cravings for a great meal. You order at the counter and they call your number when you food is ready and all you do is go and pick it up yourself. No fuss dining. There is also free water, hot tea and plastic utensils in the front - server yourself.Here are some dishes I love:-spicy fried chili chicken: fried chicken pieces that are stir fried with scallions, spicy chili and sweet yellow onions (spicy and delicious! - all time fav!)-salt an pepper squid: fried strips of squid stir fried with green peppers and onions (crispy and irresistible)-masala fish: battered fish stir fried with masala spice and veggies-eggplant with ground pork: the eggplant is soft and tender, which is well balanced with the rice ground pork-pork belly-clams with black bean sauce-mapo tofuThe staff is super friendly and have great recommendations if you're not sure what to get. Overall, great food! This place gets packed pretty quickly so make sure you snag a table!",

I don't know what they put in their food here, but everything is just really, really tasty. It's not going to win any culinary awards any time soon, but for the cheap price, you get a lot of downright delicious chinese food. I've probably been here at least a hundred times over my years on campus, so I'll try to keep this review condensed. Go to Cravings. Order the hot and spicy diced chicken. And never look back.",

Actually like many said the portions are enough for two meals. Cravings definitely has great value.

Like many of the people writing 5 star reviews, I was impressed by the large menu, the frequently cheerful staff, and the mostly reasonable prices.  But as I went to other Chinese places in town, my opinion began to change.  I noticed that most of the dishes at Cravings were really heavy and oily.  And that most of the specials were very similar to one another.  And that some of the menu options .. didn't really match what was being described.  I don't mind some innovation, and I know you can't really get a Japanese style bowl of Ramen anywhere in Champaign, but Cravings' offering is nowhere close.The last three times I went I ended up throwing out my leftovers.  I absolutely hate wasting food, but I couldn't finish them.  One was a squid special; the squid was extremely chewy and seemed overcooked.  The plate was mostly green peppers in a salty sauce, in any case.  Another was a \"coconut shrimp\" plate.  This translated to fried shrimp with (very sweet) uncooked coconut milk simply poured over them.  Unhealthy and not even tasty.  The last was Gado Gado Fish, which I remembered getting and enjoying in the past.  It was still really heavy - lots of breading with an oily, thick sauce.  If you want to spend a little more money, I highly recommend Golden Harbor instead.  But the food is much better.If you want to spend about the same or just a little more, I'd check out Lai Lai Wok instead - which I think is overrated, too, but is a bit better than Cravings.  Or you could get take-out from Rainbow Garden, which is pretty solid.  If you want to spend less, you could try out Empire or Bo Bo China.  (Bo Bo China is all you can eat if you really want to maximize your calories/dollar.)",

He was like, I have JUST the thing. Not long after, I picked up a huge bowl of soup with big ol' chunks of fish cakes, squid and shrimp. It was a hot and sour seafood soup with noodles, and it was nice and spicy. At most places, when they talk about spicy food, it's not really that hot. Not so at Cravings. I am used to eating spicy food and I was wiping my nose.Gross, I know.Anyway, the ingredients taste fresh and the portions are huge. They provide water and tea for free, which is great when it's cold outside. And they give great takeout containers for soups. I know, it's the little things. I'll definitely be back to try more on the extensive menu. Hm, I wonder if they deliver...",

It must have been a seriously high concentration because I've never had this bad of a reaction to MSG in food before. I was feeling so sick that I threw the rest of the food away and went home.

You always get more than enough meat and a side of rice. That said, the place is kind of sketchy. There are rumors that it was closed for a few days in Spring 2013 due to health violations. And I'll admit, I have seen a bug or two crawl around right on the menu. But with the delicious, greasy food that comes out of here, I'm willing to eat a couple bugs. Definitely worth it. Pro Tip: Call in your order for pick up and start walking there. By the time you get there, your order will be ready to go and all you have to do is pay. Boom.",

The flavors are amazing here and the service is amazing, the food comes out quickly.  It's feel-good, home-away-from-home cooking.  It's no wonder there's always a lot of international students and a few home-grown midwesterners eating here - they've discovered one of the best spots for Asian food in Champaign.  (And the engineering quad is also right across the street!)It's not a fancy place.  You'll clean your own plates when you're finished and when you order, you'll be given a number which they will call out from the counter.  You can grab your own silverware, napkins and cups of water/tea from the big kettles near the cash register and clear your own dishes when you're finished.  But what they lack in pomp and panache they make up for with good food and cheerful service.  Simple as that.If I had to choose to order one thing consistenlty, it would be their crispy tofu.  Hefty wedges of soft tofu are lightly breaded and fried.  It's served topped with strings of fresh green onion and this incredible thick garlic dipping sauce, which I would eat with plain rice.  It's that good!  And it's my favorite.The Indonesian Fried Rice comes with a fried egg on top and their MaPo Tofu comes spicy (chilis bring it on), in a very sharable portion.  Our dishes also came with the soup of the day, something along the lines of egg drop soup with tomotoes.  Here you will get an affordable meal with amazing Taiwanese-Indonesian-Chinese flavors.When i was a student here, I would mostly order take-out and the portions would last me at least two meals.  Come here if you want a filling, hearty meal that will nourish your heart and soul.  Dining in is great to eat family style since the dishes are shareable.  If you come consistently enough, I think you'll find your favorite dish that you'll want to order every time.  The owners are incredible people who take great pride in their restaurant.  They know they are a beloved spot on campus and treat their patrons in the same way.",

Don't just try something randomly as you might have a negative experience.The owner is very nice and every time I ran into him in Champaign, he always remembered me and said hi to me.Dishes that I recommend include -hot & spicy chicken (my go-to dish. I had this like everyday last spring); -mapo tofu (really good, spicy, and only 6.50 for a very generous portion); -gado gado chicken (nutty and sweet);-masala fish (crispy and spicy fish fillet); -beef pan fried chow fun (stir-fried beef with large noodle, really good);-Sizzling chicken pot (I have to stress it. it's SIZZLING chicken cooked with basil and onion);-Pepper and Salt Squid (apparently everything starts with \"Pepper and Salt ___\" is really good. Try pepper and salt fish also).Some more Chinese dishes that I like:-black mush room & tofu w/ groundpork;-basil pork with rice;-bean noodles with ground pork (a lot of people asked me what I had when I ordered this dish);-hot & sour seafood noodle soup (tom yum based, with LOTS of seafood, perfectly for a cold day);(these 4 dishes above can be found on the white board near the counter).The Mongolian beef is good but it's not consistent. I like it to be a bit overcooked, but sometimes it's still a little rare to my liking, especially during peak hours.These dishes are all from the Chinese menu since i'm not a big fan of Americanized dishes in general.",

I must have been to this place over 50 times. The staff is extremely friendly. Every time I go there I ask G' Tao (owner) for a new dish based on my preferences, he never disappoints. Only knock on this place the food is a little oily and I wouldn't consider it healthy eating haha. But when the food is this good who cares!Long Story Short: There have been several times where I was bashing my head at the computer lab working on an engineering project and just said \"Screw this, I'm going to Cravings\". Nothing saved the day like food from Cravings. Shop Notes: Pretty small shop and gets packed pretty quickly around lunch and dinner. Service is very quick and efficient, take out is always a good option. Very reasonably priced with pretty large portions.Sentence Summary: Is the food entirely healthy? Not really. Is it delicious and authentic? Absolutely.",

I got a vegetable - udon noodle dish, since my spot in line came up before I was ready and I had to make a snap decision.  I also got fried rice and crab rangoon.  I wish I had more time to decide, but we were in a hurry.  The menu was much larger than I was expecting, divided into different regions, and I would love to come back and try something else.Total, including tax, came to around $13, which is pretty good for the amount of food I got.  Even though I was warned to be ready for a wait, and it was the dinner rush, we got out in probably about 15 minutes.  My udon ended up being good, if a bit plain.  The crab rangoon was good, and I wish I had more of it, but it was not spectacular.  I was told the fried rice was very good, though a bit on the salty side.  Looking at the other reviews, I suspect I will have to give this place another try and order something different.  Maybe it will blow me away next time.",

Unfortunately, the summer hours aren't updated on Yelp and the place was closed early on Sunday night. Oh well, Monday night, I returned and boy, was I glad I did.This place is about as dive as you can get. But we all know, good Chinese restaurants are all about the food...so I dove into the menu. I was happy to see they had a \"Chinese\" menu for the real authentic dishes. I ordered the mushroom and tofu curry. It came with a small bowl of seaweed soup and rice. Extra rice was free (which is always should be!) as was the hot tea and ice cold water. The curry and the soup were both delicious.I returned the next time to try their famous hot and spicy chicken. WOW! The servings are enormous. There is a reason why this is the most popular dish...it was amazing.Cravings is a must try for Asian food lovers. I highly recommend it.",

Coming from a Chinese family, this place really reminds me of home with the Asian ladies peeling peas, the numerous voices chatting in different languages, and sometimes the owner's children? running around. It's a very lively place and I really like the owner - he's fluent in multiple languages and is overall a pretty cool guy. The food is really cheap and you get a lot for what you pay. One nuisance is the long lines and crowds because they're so popular, but they have a good ticket system to make sure you get your order.My favorite item is the Jakarta fried rice! I've also ordered the wonton noodles in miso soup which have lasted me for lunch, dinner, and impromptu midnight snack. Their menu is really diverse and offers home-made meals from China, India, Indonesia, and many more Asian countries. If you're from outside of the U.S. and missing home, a meal here will soothe your aching heart like chicken lo mein for the soul.",

I'm from Los Angeles, where we claim Monterrey Park and Alhambra as the official China Town of America, at least cuisine-wise, but I find that Cravings beats out most of the places I've eaten at out here.During the year I spent living in Urbana, I frequented Cravings almost every week, and during that time I have tasted almost half the items on the menu.Most students coming grab a lunch-sized dish for $5 or $6, but ordering the $8 or $9 full dishes pays off if you plan to be out studying all day. You get so much food that you can easily take half of it with you to go, so you can finish it later while studying at the library or wherever.Menu highlights include the Mongolian Beef, the Marsala Fish (careful, very spicy!), the spicy crunch chicken, or if you want healthy, the seaweed seafood dishes.If you're just a beginner, you might want to just stick with the Mongolian Beef, General Tso's chicken, or Kung Pao just to experience how they do the classics so well and full of flavor, then move on to other items in subsequent visits.My biggest regret in leaving Urbana is being able to taste the food that this wonderful Malaysian family has brought to corn-field country!",

My test of a good Chinese restaurant is to first order some Americanized dish, and if they make that well, then the authentic dishes have to be good. I ordered sesame chicken to go. The aroma driving back to the office told me something good was in the styrofoam container. I opened it, and there was the delicious smell of toasted sesame. The flavor was quite nice, but the dish was ruined by too heavy a coating of cornstarch and overcooking.Most of the pieces were very dry and hard to chew. I'll go there again, but next time it will be noodle soup or fried tofu.",

We tried it, and it became one of our mainstays. We usually order the crispy beef, which is lightly breaded and fried (I think) and then tossed in this incredible sweet-spicy sauce. One order is enough for both of us, and unlike other places that do not use the best part of the cow when they are breading and frying it and tossing it in a delicious sauce, the beef is usually really good--not tough and stringy and fatty and gross.The man who owns Cravings is very nice, and I'm always happy to see crowds eating there. They seem to have authentic dishes along with the Americanized stuff, so if you want a steamed whole fish, you can get one here. I would try other things, but I am too addicted to the crispy beef to move on.",

They've got a wide variety of cuisines here, but they're mainly a Chinese restaurant. For their Chinese food, they have separate English and Chinese menus (with American Chinese food on one, and real Chinese food on the other).The girl at the counter was very enthusiastic about explaining the menu to us. She made several recommendations and she knew everything that was in every dish on the menu. Totally different from most Chinese restaurants.*Update: The food was great. My tofu in the stir fry tofu with black fungus could've been crisper, but the seasoning was perfect. The whole dinner portion comes with unlimited rice, unlimited side soup, and hot tea for under $8! I will definitely be back again to try other things on the menu.",

They have a very extensive menu with something for everyone, they have lunch specials for even cheaper chow, and the owner is very friendly (yay for discounts, especially if you go often).  I would recommend any of their noodle or rice dishes (I frequently go with Ma Po Tofu or anything with chicken ^^) and they cater all people from those on special diets, vegetarians, Americanized Chinese food (think orange chicken), to the more traditional dishes.You can take-out as with most Chinese restaurants, but I've always sat down with friends when I eat here.

The options are pretty limited for vegetarians, but I loved the cheap price and large portions(unlimited rice!) as well as the complimentary hot tea. The ma po tofu is the classic vegetarian option that everyone orders here, but in my opinion, the real gem is the tofu in chili oil sauce. The ma po tofu was certainly good, but it was not spicy enough for me, and wasn't layered enough in various flavors. The tofu in chili oil sauce on the other hand, has the classic bite of the Sichuan peppercorn, and is actually spicy, with the varied flavor profile I look for in spicy dishes. Overall, it's definitely my favorite Chinese restaurant on campus.",

The last time I was there the man was so busy he picked up the phone and put them on hold and never picked it back up. I found it funny, but I'm sure that customer did not. And, you know, if they opt out of delivery they should really clean the place up a bit. I get worried what the kitchen looks like and have peeked back there a few times to see complete chaos (mostly because there's 8 or 9 women cooking for too many customers to handle).

My roommates and I decided to order from Cravings after realizing the Golden Harbor might be too expensive. This was probably a bad decision as we had moved from probably middle tier Chinese to low tier Chinese food in terms of price and quality.The General Tso's chicken was just OK, I've had better and it honestly more resembled orange chicken in both taste and looks.Others got a beef dish and a seafood combination which was on the Chinese menu. I had no clue many of these restaurants have Chinese menus that are often more authentic and probably better quality and tasting than the regular menus. I need to order off those menus and not the Americanized ones for future reference.The fried rice was pretty bland as well. Eggrolls not very good, either.They forgot to include a side order of crab Rangoon and when we called back they said next time we are in the Rangoon will be free. I wasn't impressed with the food but in all fairness it was like $6.50 for a large portion so at least I wasn't hungry afterwards.I still want to try some of the other Chinese places in Champaign as well as ordering off the non-Americanized menus. I think the cuisine is interesting but the quality just hasn't been there at the last couple places I've tried.",

It is also the cheapest, and they give large portions -- for me, easily enough for 2 meals usually. Most dishes are $6-8. Some more special ones are $9-12. The more American orange/General Tso's/sweet and sour/etc. chicken dishes are $5.25. The owner guy behind the counter most of the time is one of the friendliest restaurant workers I have ever met. Tips:-They make Chinese food the best. If you're unsure of what to get, your best bet is to get something Chinese instead of Japanese/Thai/etc. -Be sure to look at the white board on the floor to the left of the counter! -Explore the Chinese menu sitting on the counter (it has English translations) These are some of my favorites: Basil pork egg rice, Jakarta fried rice, Pork with preserved vegetables, Crispy beef, Fried fish fillets with bok choy, Beef stew eggplant pot, Spicy fried chicken, Mapo tofu, Sizzling chicken pot.",

That gift resulted in our spending hundreds of dollars over the years ordering food from Rainbow Garden, which became our go-to Chinese Restaurant. Tonight's order consisted of General's Chicken, Moo Shu Pork and Mongolian Beef. Although the quality of this establishment's food is usually quite good, I was disappointed that tonight's dishes were merely average. The Mongolian Beef was not as hot as it should have been and had too much beef and not enough scallions. The General's Chicken seemed to have poorer quality chicken then usual. The Moo Shu Pork was okay, but also just did not seem to be up to the usual standard of excellence.Perhaps this was just an off night. I just hope that nothing has changed to make us rethink our preferences for Chinese food in C-U.",

Prices were comparable to what I would pay back home near Chicago.  The portions were pretty decent as well.  Taste-wise the jajangmyeon was good, but not as good as back home.  There were lots of pieces of seafood and meat in the sauce, although it was a bit greasy.  Another reviewer mentioned that they serve pickled radish along with the jajangmyeon when you dine in, they seemed to omit this with my takeout order.  Not a deal breaker or anything, but little details like this which would gain them another star.  The tangsuyuk was nicely fried and cripsy.  The sauce was a great balance of sweet and sour and overall it was a solid dish.I'll be coming back to Rainbow Garden in the future when I'm craving Korean-Chinese food.",

                "review": "During weekdays, I often stop by Rainbow Garden to pick up food as it has bargain lunch prices and is one of the few options on Neil Street that isn't fast food.  For around $5 to $6, you can buy a lunch combination meal that consists of a generous portion of your chosen entree, rice, soup, and an eggroll.  My personal favorites are the chicken and green beans, barbecue pork and snow peas, and cashew shrimp.  Some dishes I've tried in the past have been a little too salty and oily (the Szechuan vegetables come to mind), but I've enjoyed most of the dishes I've ordered.Of the Chinese restaurants currently in the Champaign-Urbana area, I would consider Rainbow Garden to be the best option for a date.  The outside of the restaurant might seem somewhat unimpressive and grungy, but the interior has a very sophisticated atmosphere, with white tablecloths and dark red walls.By American standards, the wait staff might seem rude at times, but their \"cold\" disposition is considered formal and polite in Chinese culture.  A previous review complained that the staff is unaccommodating and will not make adjustments to orders.  However, I have previously asked the owners about special items, and they have been attentive and considerate of my requests.  Rainbow Garden has also offered a special menu of delicacies during previous celebrations of Chinese New Year, though from what I've heard, they might not be repeating this menu in the future (still, I think it's worthwhile to check on any potential Chinese New Year specialties).",

I was the only one in the restaurant, and there was only one hostess that had to juggle answering the phone, serving me, and helping people picking up take out orders.It went smooth enough though, and my order came fast, within minutes. I ordered the chicken with green beans, one of my favorite Chinese dishes back home.  Unfortunately... it's hard to believe I'm saying this, but the dish was completely tasteless . In fact, the only thing I could taste was the oil, and oil does not taste too good... The dish just seemed to be poorly cut chicken and old green beans tossed in some cooking oil and stir fried.  There was a little soy sauce, but it did nothing to add to the flavor, and only added to the color.All and all, the place is nice inside, and for only one waiter, the service was good.  Unfortunately, the food was extremely bland, and I will not be going here again. I probably could have done better at home.",

It came with a loads of seafood, beef, and vegetables. We also got the sweet fried beef, which was also very tasty. I was very pleased with those dishes, especially my black bean noodles.

After my last excursion for Chinese, I've become a brand loyalist to Golden Harbor Unfortunately for me, G.H. was packed like sardines tonight.Thus, it was Rainbow Garden, and perhaps we should chalk it up to my perpetually low expectations for Chinese, but I actually enjoyed this place. It's fairly reasonably priced, the decor is nice (i.e. not a whole in the wall) and unlike G.H., it's more of a traditional restaurant service experience. Where Rainbow Garden is scoring most of its points is that, as some of the other reviews have noted, the service was fantastic. By that I mean, we had food within 10 minutes of ordering it and glasses that never really got empty.The food was good, I suppose. I liked it enough. I'd come back. I wish they gave me some more rice though. I like a lot of rice.",

The dinning area is not that big, and the tables are kind of close together.  Though I think the atmosphere is very cozy and welcoming.  Everything here is very clean as well.Quick service that is very friendly.  A large menu, and all is very well made and prepared.  Fresh and tasty food.  Lots of lunch and dinner specials as well.  I always love the dumplings (how can anybody not love them).  The different types of pork, chicken, and beef are all excellent.  From sweet n sour to BBQ or stir fry.  A small beer and wine menu.  I think the newer location in Urbana has a full bar, but here it is pretty bare bones.  Though the Gekkeikan Plum Wine is amazing.  I am not usually a huge fan of Chinese restaurants, but this is a great place cause everything is true to form, fresh, and well made.  In the States anyway, especially small college towns, there are to many crappy Chinese places that would make the health department go crazy.  If all were of this quality, I would go for Chinese more often.",

The entrees are relatively expensive and each of them can be shared by two people since they don't give you too much food. I thought that the fried rice was good, but the only reason it was good was due to the portentous amount of soy sauce that was blanketed over it. I also found it odd that employees were in the restaurant working on their establishment's balance sheets as well as folding napkins. Water is on my top 5 of favorite beverages and I have to say that the water here was absolutely filthy. Perhaps the worst aspect I experienced here was the server only speaking in Chinese despite knowing that there were English-speaking people at the table. He didn't address us at all and just choose to talk Chinese to the only person in the table to understand it. That was extremely rude and I was quite offended by it.",

Rainbow Garden had a nice oriental ambiance. I'm not referring to the tacky and excess Asian imageries on many walls of Asian restaurants in general. The interior space had a beautiful red wall with red/black elements and simple oriental decor complementing the space. You don't see many places like that at Asian restaurants. Enough with the wall color and such....The lunch special was a very reasonable price ranging between $5-$6. It consist of the type of meat/veg, your choice of fried or white rice, 1 egg roll, and your choice of sweet/sour soup or egg drop soup. The lunch portion is very nice and I think $5-$6 for lunch is very reasonable. However, their regular entrees after lunch might be a little pricey for a hungry, poor college kid.  My boyfriend and I have grown to have bigger appetite over the month. We shared a Mongolian lunch special with two jja jang myuns (black bean noodle with shrimp, meat, and assorted veggies) which was a little too much. The jja jang myun was very tasty and I would recommend people to try it, and they serve you pickled yellow raddish on the side. More importantly, I would highly recommend people to stop ordering delivery for once, get off their lazy butts, get out, and experience their dining service for once. :)Don't get me wrong, their delivery service is fast and good also.",

Same with the lo mein ..I've had way more things there but I can't remember but it's great. Try anything.

The other dish had no flavor really.  I am not sure what it was missing (well...flavor) but it was just not that good.  The crab rangoon were good though a little too cream cheesy.I dont know. The rest of the dishes that people got looked okay--no one was really raving about how good the food was.  It was reasonably priced.Like I said, I was hungry.  Hungry enough for it again when I am in Champaign? Probably not.",

They have the usual lunch special: soup, spring roll and entree with rice for $6-$8.  The lunch specials are a great value, however they only include the common/popular Chinese restaurant dishes such as general tso's, princess, garlic sauce, etc.  If you want something different, you have to order off of the full menu.  But the food quality here is very good and everything tastes fresh.  I'm a fan.",

The prices are about the same as any other Chinese restaurant in the area as are the portions (unless you have a large appetite, one dish can usually provide two meals).  My only complaint is that while dining in they do not provide enough rice with their meals.  This isn't a problem, though, as they are happy to give you more upon request.",

It was presented attractively and the portions are enough to feed you for dinner and again for lunch tomorrow.  I ordered a vegetarian stir-fried noodle dish and was totally happy with my selection.  I tried a bite of my roomate's fried rice, which was a bit oily for my liking, but still tasted quite good.    I will warn you against ordering the egg rolls, because they are the frozen kind.  They taste just like the ones at Panda Express.  I think I would give this restaurant 5 stars if their egg rolls were bigger and homemade.  Over-all it was a pleasure to eat here and I will definetly go back!",

I like Rainbow Garden's fried tofu, sole fillet, deep fried pork, salt & pepper squid, seafood bird's nest, and pan fried noodles. I'm also a fan of their Korean Chinese fusion foods, something that's pretty common in the Chicago area. Overall, it's great to escape from the hustle and bustle of inner campus once in a while and enjoy a scrumptious meal at Rainbow Garden.",

We always order the General's Chicken and Barbecued Pork Fried Rice.   I have recently been ordering the Singapore Style Rice Noodles, and they have been very good.  We've tried many of their dishes and all of them have been pretty good.  I'm a big fan of their hot-&-sour soup, over other similar places in the area. Delivery is always very quick.  I've also eaten in the restaurant for lunch a few times over the years, and that is also a pleasant experience.

As one of the few Chinese restaurants south of Green Street, it is worth a visit over China King.I had the sweet and sour chicken lunch special that came with a small eggroll and your choice of hot and sour or egg drop soup. - The chicken was battered just right and not too oily, and the sweet and sour sauce came with white onions, green peppers and carrots. I also appreciated that they only used white meat chicken.- The eggroll is small but one of the most flavorful I've had among the Chinese restaurants in the area.- The fried rice was among the best I've had with ample vegetables and scrambled egg- The hot and sour soup needed more vinegar, but I still liked that among the Chinese restaurants I've visited for lunch, they offered soup.Rainbow Garden's ambiance also makes it a nice date spout with booths and red wood themes. The restaurant is actually much bigger than you would perceive from the outside.My only complaint is it's hard to park in their lot given the giant billboard in the middle of it.",

You will usually be waited on by the proprietress, who is one of the nicest and sweetest people in Champaign-Urbana :) The food is pretty good, although perhaps adjusted for American tastes. It reminds me of the many neighborhood Chinese places all up and down Manhattan. I've had a lot of good lunches there - I can recommend the chicken dishes and the shrimp kung pao. Also good won ton soup.",

I said why would she think that, I gave my card info and everything and she said 30 mins. So then I ask when my order will now be delivered and she says that she thinks they don't deliver here. I say ok, but you just delivered here 2 weeks ago so she says well, that was 2 weeks ago-BEYOND astonished at how rude that was!! I told her they really need to get their act together and that that was terrible customer service and hung up. RUDE!",

                "review": "For years I lived a block from this little unsuspecting restaurant, and I always passed it by because I thought it was just another greasy counter serving your average Chinese fare.  If you walk into Peking Garden and they hand you that menu with the classic Americanized dishes (General Tso's chicken, lo mien, fried rice, etc.), tell them that you actually want to see the menu with the traditional, true-blue Chinese dishes (squid, sea cucumber, etc.).  Unfortunately, I can't vouch for the Americanized food items as I've never tasted them.  However, there IS just one thing that makes this restaurant GOLDEN in my book: Peking Garden is the ONLY Chinese restaurant in the Champaign-Urbana area (to my knowledge) where you can eat a very specific type of traditional Chinese cuisine called hot pot (sometimes called shabu-shabu in Japanese restaurants).  If you've never eaten hot pot before, let me explain the general idea: a portable stove and miniature pot of boiling broth will be brought to your table.  You will also be given plates of raw vegetables, meat, and noodles.  You toss whatever you want to eat into the pot, wait a few minutes, and then start serving the soup from your table.  Definitely a treat during winter months, and worth a try for adventurous diners!    I haven't tried too many other dishes here, but I did order dumplings once, and have been requesting them on visits ever since.  Usually most Asian restaurants (even the Chinese ones) sell what I consider Japanese or Korean dumplings.  The outside dough is paper-thin, indicating that the dumplings were probably bought frozen instead of prepared in-store.  At Peking Garden, the dumpling dough is thick and chewy, the way Chinese dumplings are SUPPOSED to be!  The meat filling is still a little plain (just ground pork and a few carrots, nothing special), but the dough wrappers are FO' REAL!The interior decor is that faded '80s look that seems to plague a lot of the restaurants in this area.  You can't really tell if the evening mood lighting is actually mood lighting or if they just didn't bother to fix some broken bulbs.  I wouldn't recommend this place for a romantic rendezvous, but it could be fun for friends eating in large groups.Everybody loves Lai Lai or Golden Harbor, and while the menus at those restaurants are a good deal larger, Peking Garden does have its own unique specialty, the hot pot.  If you're not sure what to do when you get there, stare at the tables of Chinese diners, follow their lead, and you won't be disappointed!",

Peking Garden was a weird case for me though.This place is EXTREMELY hit or miss, more so then I ever seen a restaurant be... The first time I went here with coworkers, the food was hot, came quick, and tasted terrific. At the time, I would have ALMOST gave it a 5 star rating. I was glad I didn't though. I went back a second time and the food came out cold, there was a long wait, and it didn't taste nearly as good. I went back a third time, and this time the food was just average tasting.  My entree was great but the soup and egg roll tasted weird.. The service was also bad this trip. The 4th time I went back though was what ultimately makes the place deserve the 2 star rating, as not only was the service terrible, but our food took almost 45 minutes to come out and there were only three tables filled in the restaurant. The worst part was that me and my girlfriend got food sickness from it... It was not fun especially since we both had to work later that day.  We are pretty sure it was from the egg drop soup.  It had large chunks of either oil or raw egg in it, and we were sick for nearly two weeks with stomach cramps.  Somewhat trivial but the day was only made worse as the waitress made pricing errors on my bill, of which I had to argue with her that egg rolls came with the lunch special and were not supposed to be an extra charge... At this point, other then the first time I went there, the food has been pretty sub-par, and food comes out cold way too often... Service can also go from great to absolutely terrible depending on who is working that day. I wanted to really like this place since it is close to my work, and the food is priced right ($6-7 for a big plate), but unfortunately, bad service, long wait times, and food that frequently goes from tasting good to absolutely terribly has me moving on. Eater's beware, maybe you'll get a good meal, but you may get a terrible one too....",

I go there all the time, and it's such a nice refreshing change from many other restaurants with bad and distant service. Not only does Peking Garden have great service, but their food is so unbelievably tasty. Try their crunchy wontons or egg rolls for appetizers, they are always such a hot treat. You can also ask them to make a dish with special considerations (like \"make it non-sweet\") and they never give you trouble for specific requests (unlike other restaurants in town.)Overall, it's a really nice atmosphere with private booths, relaxing eastern music in the background and smiles for miles.",

The register was packed when I arrived and the manager quickly noticed us hiding behind the swarm of people and we were quickly seated with apologies for the wait and noise. It is a slightly nicer place to have Chinese food in Chambana as the decor extends away from the fast food theme of their take-out menu.  My family and I received the 'authentic' blue menu upon arriving (I'm assuming because we are Chinese) but if you don't receive it automatically I highly suggest you directly ask for it.  The all inclusive hot pot was one of the best things I had there and can easily be a full meal for a single person as it includes clear rice noodles for some filling carbs.  The shredded Szechuan spicy pork was a close second though it should be noted for people who don't know how Chinese pork is shredded, it is cut into thin slices and THEN cooked versus the famous bbq shredded pork in America which is slow cooked and then shredded by hand.  This leads to a more solid texture in the meat and it great when paired with thinly cut vegetables as they do with this dish. The ziran beef had strong flavors and wasn't drenched in a sauce like Americanized places.  For those who are afraid to try it, ziran means cumin so if you like cumin you will love this flavor of beef.  The ambiance is great for large groups as most tables are large and plates are obviously meant for sharing. She does have small kids running around the area but I feel it adds to the homey feel of the restaurant.",

But after reading the menu I thought I'd give it a try as it looked authentic enough (to me...). Maybe I ordered the wrong thing (Hunan chicken), but it was really disappointing: bland Chinese American, nothing tasty, nothing original. I took a few bites and threw the rest in the trash (... I can't believe I'm confessing to this!...). Kudos, though, for: the very extensive menu, the friendly waitress, and staying till 11pm (which is rare for Champaign). Maybe I'll give it another try.",

I've never had such a horrible and disgusting excuse for fried rice.  There was nothing in it.  No bits of egg, no meat, no shreds of carrot, no scallion, no onion, no peas.  Nothing.  A scoop full of sticky brown-ish rice.  It smelled like cardboard and had no discernible flavor.  Just rice doused with soy sauce.  Effing gross.The chicken did not taste like General Tso.  It was like they added a tad of soy sauce to the sweet n' sour.  It was not spicy.  It was not flavorful.  And the meat itself?  Dry, tough, stringy, chewy.The rangoon were filled with cream cheese, but they didn't seem to have any crab.This place blows.",

Sure, there were plenty of places on Green that served Chinese but since I'm a bit spoiled by the quality of Chinese food on the West Coast, it never really satisfied me. So, the next best option was to get delivery. Nothing beats settling in with a good bowl of hot and sour soup right before finals. I really like their pepper salted shrimp, buns, braised string beans/kong xin cai, soup, and stir fried noodles. Go for their authentic dishes, some of the more Americanized ones can be sort of lacklustre (for example, General Tso's Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken...) If you want to go to the physical restaurant it might be kind of hard to find since it's a little bit of a hole in the wall but it's definitely worth it. Pros:-Fast delivery-Secure delivery. I haven't had a single dish spill en-route before, unlike a lot of places!-Super nice service-Reasonably priced (a LOT of places on campus are really expensive considering what they're feeding you but this place is awesome.)-Good food-Good portions-Good variety-Good for groups-Interior of the store is cozy, clean, and well doneCons:-Food can be oily, but to be honest those particular dishes are oily anywhere-The Americanized dishes aren't that good in my opinion-It might be a bit hard to communicate with the restaurant if you don't speak any Chinese but the online ordering is done via services like Eat24 and in person you can just point to what you want. Not that big of an issue.-Sometimes food might be too salty, but if you tell them that you want less salt, they'll follow your request.-Delivery only on $20+ so I recommend just buying with other people or buying a portion for dinner. They give you plenty of rice so you'll have more than enough for a couple meals.",

It's a sweet and sour dish and will certainly complement the fiery-hot spicy chicken.Other recommendations include mongolian beef, eggplant in garlic sauce, and fish-in-a-plate with spicy sauce.In ethnic restaurants I try to avoid dishes commonly found in fast food restaurants (orange chicken, general tso's chicken in a chinese restaurant for example). So, if you want to try something different Peking Garden is a great place - the owner, although not very fluent in English, tries her best to accommodate your needs.",

The food and portions were great: I had a bunch of leftovers almost enough for another meal. I enjoyed the fried noodles that came with the Mandarin beef although the Mongolian beef was a little too chewy. It was not bad by any means, but I have tried better Mongolian beef dishes. I think the service is a five stars although I only had a limited experience with it on my pick-up order. The staff took my phone order accurately and quickly, understanding all of the items I requested, which was a pleasant surprise. I was given an ETA of my food being ready for pickup within 10 minutes after ordering. I found my order already done when I went to pick it up about 15 minutes after my call. The cashier was also friendly and remembered what I ordered right away. There were a couple other orders ready when I went. Two small complaints I have are the soy sauce and fortune cookies. I ended up using my own soy sauce because of some sketchy ingredients in the soy sauce packets. (see my picture below) Also, the fortune cookies were a bit stale, you can bend it back and forth because of the moisture. Anyways, this didn't bother me too much because I don't usually eat fortune cookies anyways and I had my own soy sauce at home. Overall a 4.5 if not 5 stars for the great food and service, and almost one off for the two small complaints above.",

Nate decided that he was going to have a Mai Tai, and it came in a disturbing Fu-Manchu mug complete with exaggerated Asian features.  I was horrified and delighted simultaneously.But not as delighted as when my friend Emily and I orderd the \"Hawaii + Love Bowl,\" a gigantic bowl of alcohol filled with cherries and anchored in the center by a small well of rum--SET ON FIRE.Hells yes.  Because nothing says, \"I've just moved to a small Midwest college town\" like \"Let's consume the flaming jungle juice of the gods, ladies and gentlemen!\"The food was good, although I found my shrimp fried rice as boring as it sounds.  That was my fault for ordering it, not theirs for making it.  I sampled everyone else's dishes however, and they were quite tasty.  And when my uppity friend Myra bellowed that she didn't like our fortunes, they gave us brand new fortune cookies.  Except the second time--my fortune was blank.  Please Jesus, tell me that doesn't mean I'm going to die from drinking the \"Hawaii + Love Bowl.\"",

The woman who normally takes my order over the phone is usually the same person who delivers the food to me.  She is a sweetheart, and when I ordered from a different phone number than I normally do, she recognized my address right away when I gave it to her and asked how I was doing.  What a great memory and way to connect with your customers!Now, for the food.  I've only ordered a couple dishes from here, but I feel no need to change my order any time soon-Mongolian beef and the General Tso's is the usual.  First of all, I love that they ask no questions about making things spicy/extra spicy.  The mongolian beef is ordinarily not spicy, but when I asked if they could add some spice, they enthusiastically said yes- I haven't ordered it unspicy since.  The beef is sooo tender and the sauce they cook it in is to die for.  I literally would eat it everyday if I had a heart of steel.  The General Tso's is pretty good, although not outstanding.  It's a little too sweet and saucy for my taste, but I like to have something to contrast the beef, so this is usually what I go for.The only other dish I've ordered is the Fried Diced Chicken w Red Pepper.  It's pretty much a party in your mouth.  Super spicy, just how I like it- the chicken is cut up small, covered in batter, and deep fried, almost like popcorn chicken, and salty, which is awesome with a plain white rice.  The only reason I don't order this all the time is because it's a little too spicy and I don't want to regret eating it the next day.So, I can't speak for a ton of dishes, but the ones I've had thus far have been very palatable.  And the delivery service is great.  Woohoo!",

I finally had the opportunity to try it out after suggesting it to a roommate over other options.Since I've reviewed another Chinese restaurant and hope to continue doing so, I decided it would be best to get the same dish (General's Chicken).  I know this is not traditional Chinese but it is a common dish and is one of my favorites.The first difficulty I had with Peking Garden is ordering.  They do not have a website and it is not easily found online.  Luckily I was able to find one on campusfood.com.  Next, I noticed that the entrees were sort of expensive (my dish was $10.90 with tax).  This isn't too outrageous as the portions were relatively large but there are plenty of other, cheaper options in the area.After finding the menu and placing the order over the phone, I was told it would only be about 10 minutes until our food was ready.  When we arrived around 10 minutes later, our food was waiting for us at the front counter.  One thing that I did not care for right away was that the rice for both of our orders was included in one container.  This isn't a huge deal but would have been easier for us had they been separate.   My meal had pretty good flavor, though it wasn't as spicy as other places.  Despite the flavor, both my roommate and I noticed that the chicken was tough to the point it was chewy.  This is probably the biggest reason for my 3-star rating as almost all other Chinese I have had has been very tender.Overall the meal was good but I doubt that I will be returning to Peking Garden anytime soon.",

They have a great menu that a health nut, a vegan, and an all-around omnivore could handle.  That, and the appetizers were very yummy.I don't remember the specific name of the dish I ordered (I think Szechuan Tofu) but the portion was HUGE.  After eating dinner, I had 3 full lunches (+ white rice) packed away from this one.  My friend ordered a really great looking orange chicken, and my health-nut friend got a really nice shrimp stir fry request.Not only that, but they are very accommodating.  My vegan self loves fried rice every now and then, and they obligingly made it sans egg.  This place is great.  Everyone's food was fantastic, and they seem to really take special orders very, very well.  Goooo heeeeereee om nom nom...",

The chicken itself was cooked well, though the batter had very little flavor (understandable due to the dish being sauce based). The sauce was not something I enjoy at all, but SO thought it was decent.",

Auntie Lee is pretty hard to find because they share a building complex with an Indian grocery store. Seating is pretty scarce, and there are no restrooms for public use, although I am sure the kind staff would let you use it in emergencies. I also had to wait a while for my order to be ready, ordering by phone is the way to go. Because of this, I would recommend you to order to go in advance by phone and pick it up. I was pleasantly surprised when I picked up my delicious order. The food was not too salty or sweet, just right for me. I enjoyed the food, and the portions were excellent, leaving me plenty for leftovers. The next day, the food was just as good after a 1 minute microwaving. Because of this, I know the food is natural and not the \"fake food\" served my McDonalds and some cheap Chinese restaurants. I would definitely give the excellent food a five star. The service is excellent, with friendly staff that are prompt and accurate at taking your order. When I ordered online, the chef had followed my special request placed through GrubHub exactly, packing my food in microwave reheatable boxes and holding off on the sauce with my orange chicken. Just like the excellent food, Auntie Lee's also nailed it with its excellent service. Another plus is that they are open until 1am, sometimes even later, making Auntie Lee's the perfect go-to for late night ordering. Although I am am not a late night person, I will definitely order Auntie Lee's if I ever find myself wanting a late night snack. Overall, I would recommend Auntie Lee's to anyone, even someone that doesn't really care for Chinese food. With food this good, they might just change their mind!",

They did deliver the vegetable dumplings, which were soggy and coming apart. They delivered the hot and sour soup that was so over salted as to be inedible, I had to dump it out after a couple bites. They did deliver the Szechuan chicken with white rice, but the rice was significantly over cooked and the chicken was at best mediocre. Needless to say, my first experience with Auntie Lee will be my last.",

Auntie Lee's was one of the few places open that deliver at that hour on a Thursday that I haven't tried before.They also let you conveniently order online. I didn't have to call or even use a third party service like grubhub which was nice. The beyondmenu website was pretty straightforward, but nearly all of the menu items didn't have a description of them. I typically like to try something new, but when I can't be certain it's something I might like, it's a little off-putting and I end up going with a \"safe\" option, in this case, it was a sesame chicken combo with a side order of pork dumplings.Delivery was really fast, less than ~25 minutes. The place is right down the street from my place though so I would hope it doesn't take too long.I unpacked all the containers and dug in. The sesame chicken was just alright. I thought the first couple bites were good, but the sauce the chicken was in got kind of boring and sweet & sour-y tasting, which I feel like happens to a lot of Chinese food. There was a decent portion of chicken, but there were hardly any vegetables, I'd say maybe 4 pieces of broccoli, tops, and nothing else. The fried rice that came with it was also a fairly good sized portion, definitely better tasting than any white rice, in my opinion. The eggroll didn't impress me, I feel like it was something out of the freezer. The dumplings seemed just alright, too. The outside was tasty but the inside pork didn't impress me. Overall, it was just alright. After everything was said and done, this cost me $20 with delivery and tip. It was a good amount of food, but I personally didn't think it was anything special, or worth anywhere close to $20. There's something about most carry out/delivery Chinese food that just doesn't impress me. I feel like the meat and fillings are almost always low quality, and the price doesn't even reflect that. My chicken entree and 1 egg roll was $8.55I digress. It's fairly standard Chinese. Good late-night option, quick delivery, online ordering.",

Service was a little slow as I watched the woman scooping the white rice into the take-away container. She realized her error and simply dumped the white rice back into the original container and started scooping up the fried rice into the same take-away container. Eventually, they laid 8 pieces of fairly large sized chicken (they look like chicken strips) on top of the bed of rice, and gave me a cup of sweet & sour sauce. Their sauce is atrocious. I brought the leftovers to work for lunch today, and the sauce will not reheat; it's a gelatinous blob of red goo - absolutely disgusting! Save your money and go anyplace else in town!",

I don't ever go here to sit down (and don't plan on it), but the drive through is awesome for a quick boat-load of yummy carbs.  I get a box FULL of steaming rice and pick a 2-item combo from their daily menu, usually chicken with mushrooms or szechuan beef.  For around $5, it's the best bang for your buck.The brown paper bag they hand over probably weighs several pounds and my hand buckles as I lift it through my window.  Their eggrolls and crab rangoon are good... everything is a version of \"americanized\" Chinese food.   I don't see a lot of asians frequenting this place because they don't offer much variety or quality of flavor but hey, I can't complain!  (From what I've encountered through the drive-through), the workers are smiley, pretty nice and very efficient.  It's not gourmet, but when I'm hungry and telling myself \"not pizza again...\" it will be Hot Wok Express.  Just slather on some sriracha hot sauce.",

First off, I don't think this place understands what half and half means since they just gave me all fried rice. Second, they have three different types of fried rice rather than just one type. Third, they don't show exact prices for how their combo plates work. Fourth, they give you enough food to feed two people. I paid $7 for fried rice and two menu items. Though they serve portentous portions, the quality of the food is lacking. Also, the person taking my order gave one of the biggest sighs I've ever heard. Dang, she must've really wanted the day to be over and was getting tired of serving or whatever.",

I saw the reviews but thought 3-stars was good enough so I'd give it a try. The service was fast (6:30pm) and friendly. I had the chicken fried rice, curry chicken, and an egg roll (half size plate). I ate the food, but like I said, I was basically starving and could have made a meal of cardboard. The curry chicken was good (I got a leg and a thigh) and the egg roll was okay. The chicken fried rice was not good at all. It had a light yellow tint and a few pieces of hard chicken in it. No onions, carrots or any other vegetables you normally find in fried rice....it was more like \"chicken flavored rice\". Anyway, I spent $6.95 and got full, but didn't like myself for it. I won't go back and won't recommend it to anyone.",

You often get two meals for the price of one, and paying the little bit extra for two different toppings is well worth it.Two of the best days are Tuesday for Beef Curry Day and Fridays for Coconut Shrimp Day.  Both of these are excellent and worth saving a special day to have.  The regular dishes are great too.  I love the chicken and green beans, the General's chicken, and cashew chicken.  Going around a set meal time will ensure you always have fresh food.  However, this place isn't one to let lots of food sit around so even at an off time you are going to get something made pretty new.",

But, for a very low price, you can fill a styrofoam box, and your stomach to the top. I got orange chicken and beef & broccoli over pork-fried rice and 3 (soft/stale) almond cookies for $6.95. It will last me two meals. That's not bad, and for dopamine-inducing comfort food, sometimes quantity is all you need.",

As soon as we were seated, the waitress asked us if we were ready to order.  We asked for additional time as it is an extensive menu with lots of interesting dishes.  Once we ordered and received our food, our waitress never came back to check on us for refills on our drinks or to inquire whether we were enjoying our food (we were). The prices seem a bit high for the portions, but the main complaint is that a 15% gratuity was added to the bill.  I have seen this in restaurants in larger cities or with large groups (we were a party of 2), but it is not typical in this area and the service certainly didn't warrant a large tip.  Plus, when we paid by credit card, the cashier said we could add a tip to the receipt- on TOP of the tip the restaurant had added. Our bill for two dinners with only water to drink was a bit over $35, which I consider high for Chinese restaurants in this area.  Hopefully they will work out the service issues and maybe adjust their price/tip policy, but the food was great and worth at least one trip.",

The dishes offer quality ingredients, but the preparation of the entrees is uninspired and the appetizers average, with no real pop in flavor. We stopped in for lunch, since lunch specials offer a reasonable price at which to try a new restaurant. We were excited by reviews of authentic and spicy food focusing on the Szechuan region.The lunch special menu was made up of only Chinese American standard dishes, which was a disappointment. I ordered the chicken with garlic sauce and fried rice. My partner ordered General Tso's with steamed rice. We also had meat dumplings and the Shanghai spring rolls. We didn't get the soup, since a single-serving appetizer portion of soup was $5. The pricing overall is uneven.My entre, the chicken with garlic sauce, came with chicken, mushrooms, broccoli, and other vegetables. It had little to no garlic flavor, but a pleasant late lingering spice. The entree had far, far too much sauce, and of the slightly too sweet, gloppy variety (so much that I was a little disgusted by it). My partner's General Tso's chicken was crispy, but again too sweet and little spice. The fried rice with my dish was fine, but lacked any aromatics and had no meat for flavoring either. We did not receive spoons with any dish to help serve portions onto a smaller plate.The meat dumplings were in the long wrappers pinched on one side. They seemed like they might contain pork mixed with chicken. They lacked in flavor -- no ginger, garlic, herb -- and were underseasoned. The spring rolls came with a spring roll wrapper. The server (whose English was not great) said he thought they had meat in them. He agreed to cabbage but seemed less sure. They had cabbage in them, but the meat was hard to see or taste. They had a decent texture, but didn't taste like much on the inside. The dipping sauce for the potstickers was vinegary and salty (soy base) with no scallions, garlic, or other flavoring. The dipping sauce for the spring rolls was standard sweet n sour. We asked for hot mustard and received carryout packets.The portion size for lunch was generous enough. The value was decent. The hot tea was good, but was not replenished by mid meal.I complained on the way out that we were automatically charged a 15% tip on the bill for a party of two. The woman at the front counter said they are doing this because in China tipping is not done and many Chinese who eat at restaurants here do not tip. I don't think it's legal for the restaurant to include the tip automatically in the bill, but I'm not sure. There are no signs or notices about it. I told her it would offend American customers. In our case, it also cheated the server, because we usually tip 20%.We have speculated that the many authentic Chinese menu items might be better prepared and interesting. There are many dishes with traditional ingredients (such as tripe). We can't confirm that they are any better, however.Given the underwhelming preparation and the weak service with the required gratuity, I doubt that we will be back.",

A little over a week ago, my wife and I decided to try Szechuan China. When we walked into the place we were encouraged, because we were the only Anglos there. If Asians liked it, it must be good! And for all I know, it is outstanding according to genuine ethnic standards. The hostess was very friendly, as was our waiter, although he did not appear to understand that, when there are a gazillion items on a menu, diners should not be expected to order within three minutes of being seated. When our orders arrived (rather quickly, in fact), both were feasts for the eyes. Everything was great thus far.But that's where the feast ended. My wife ordered a dish that featured mushrooms and tofu. Although beautiful to look at, it was tasteless. We both decided that they must not have added any flavorings to it--it appeared to be just mushrooms and tofu, nothing else (except for, presumably, the cornstarch that created the lovely thickness of the sauce).My entree, a Szechuan dish featuring poached fish in a very hot chili sauce, at first impressed me with its zing. But after a minute or so, I began to taste the salt. Wow! I grew up with traditional Texas cuisine, which means that I was pretty much pickled in sodium chloride by the time I was in my teens--so saltiness is not inimical to my taste buds. But this was beyond the pale. I was still tasting the salt half an hour after I got home, even after rinsing my mouth several times with water. (I should also mention that the dish overflowed with oil.)Because we are impecunious, we never leave food on our plates at a restaurant; we even carry rather substantial containers in our car so that we don't have to ask for unecological Styrofoam containers. Yet this is the first time in our many years of marriage that we have left substantial portions of restaurant dishes on our plates. I was able to eat only about a third of my food before the extreme saltiness forced me to stop eating. My wife ate about a fourth of her entree before its tastelessness led her to stop eating. And we had absolutely no desire to take the leftovers home. I fixed some snacks for us after we got home to satisfy our still-significant hunger.To their credit, the kind folks at the restaurant offered to give us a discount (which we refused). We left a generous tip. We understand it's possible that we happened to order dishes that were anomalously poor. But we figure that, as rarely as we eat out, we dare not risk another fifty bucks by returning to Szechuan China.",

Unfortunately, most of the people reviewing Chinese places here non-Chinese (like 90% white people). There's a reason that this place's parking lot is often full of cars; several of my international student friends that have eaten here have all said that they love it. Last time I went with some, one of them said about some of the dishes: \"It feels like I'm back in China.\" If you would like some help with what to order, I highly recommend the following:Chongqing fish filet with pickled vegetablesOx tongue and tripe with chili saucehot and sour shredded potatoeggplant with chili sauceseared cow stomachsan bei chicken",

I ordered from the vegetarian portion of the menu and the dish that came looked interesting but it was about 50% fish. I explained that I don't eat animals at all and since the dish was in the vegetarian section and didn't specifically say it contained animals, I was expecting a vegetarian dish. The waitress asked if I liked vegetables (really) and suggested a tofu and bok choi dish. I was a bit apprehensive because \"tofu and bok choi\" tends to be incredibly boring, but as the staff recommended it, I thought it must be a good choice. NOPE! The dish was swimming in translucent, viscous, whitish sauce that lacked any flavor besides salt. I ate a few pieces of tofu and they were bland and squishy, the bok choi was limp and similarly flavorless. I didn't bother trying the frozen carrot cubes or peas that were floating in the sea of slime. After a few minutes, the sauce began to congeal. It was, quite frankly, disgusting. A server asked if I liked the dish and, trying to be nice, I told her it was very bland and not to my tastes. She asked if I wanted to take it to go (uh, no) and when I said I did not, she picked it up, made a strange face, sticking out her tongue, and took it away. I don't know if she didn't see that I was looking at her or if she was sympathizing.I'm sad to say, the rice wasn't even good. My partner did like his dish and said the fishy tofu was pretty good but also had a slimy sauce. They charged us for all 3 dishes and a 15% tip on top of it! The tip wasn't indicated anywhere that we could see, so basically it's a rip off.",

So i think they are starting to learn how to be more vegetarian accessible. they also asked if we had any questions about the menu. where i am from the menus for szechuan won't be that descriptive and will not have pictures, i appreciated that they took the time to explain what their dishes are. I also like how they converted the decor of the place. looking forward to trying more stuff on the menu. i love that they brought some heat to this town.",

I would expect exceptional food to justify the small-ish portions for the price, but nothing was exceptional about Szechuan China.  I have tried the beef with garlic and scallions and pan fried fish strips. The beef was really really salty. Even eating it with a bunch of rice and water I only finished about three quarters of the already small portion before deciding to save it. When I tried to eat that stuff the next day I ended up throwing out the rest. On the plus side the fish was actually pretty good compared to the salty stuff they called beef. They actually filled up the plastic container it came in this time, and it actually tasted alright. One minor complaint is that the menu said the fish was \"pan fried\" but I received more of a steamed dish. I don't know if they made a mistake in my order or the pan fried fish is actually supposed to be like that. The price was a tad expensive, but after the \"grand opening 15% discount\" was applied the prices were very reasonable. If the limited time discount went away I would definitely pass on this place. I might give Szechuan China another chance sometime soon but I doubt other dishes will be very good given my first experience with them. I wouldn't say they're horrible, but the mix of high price and subpar food is a turn off.",

                "review": "EDIT: It appears that the restaurant owners (or somebody else affiliated with the business) have taken to writing fake shill reviews in a pathetic attempt to manipulate their overall rating. Notice that all of the 5-star reviews are by users with only 1 or 2 reviews. They probably gave one another most of their useful/funny/cool votes. In fact, Gabrielle Y.'s original review was removed by the Yelp admin, but a new one was posted IMMEDIATELY (literally within a few minutes). I urge my fellow Yelpers to read everything carefully and decide for yourself which ones to trust.My original review is below:--Wow, I haven't been this disappointed in a long time. My fiance and I had been excited about coming here since we first saw the signage outside last month, and we finally came today (a Saturday), around 11:30 AM. The first thing we noticed is how disorganized the place is; they were busy training a new employee and none of the others was dealing with the line of customers waiting to order. The place wasn't super busy, maybe a dozen people eating and 4 others in line ahead of us.The way this place works: ingredients are separated into meats (which include fish, shrimp, etc.), vegetables, and \"mixed meats\" (fish balls and quail eggs). You tell them which ingredients you want, they put them all in a bowl, and cook in a soup with your broth of choice. Meats are $2 each, vegetables $1, mixed meats $1.50. While the concept is fine, the poor organization here means ordering is very inefficient. The staff are Chinese and so are we, but they didn't know the names of several items we asked for. I imagine it would be even more confusing for English speakers. They don't have a large quantity of the ingredients on the counter, so they are constantly running out of things and running to replace with a new batch. They also failed to keep track of what ingredients we ordered, and we had to help them add it up. All in all, ordering was a messy ordeal and I don't want to imagine how they handle the crowds during busier times. Personally, I think they should let customers fill their own bowl and pay by weight (like most similar places in China), or a fixed price per bowl (like the Mongolian grill type places in America). By charging different prices for different ingredients they may be squeezing out better profit margins, but at the cost of poor operating efficiency. I also think they should call your number and have you pick up your order at the counter, rather than trying to bring it to your table, which they can't find and end up constantly calling out numbers anyways. At the very least, they should let customers get their own chopsticks, napkins, and cups of water - it's yet another extra burden on the already disorganized staff. We asked for \"slightly spicy\" broth but what we got lit our mouths on fire. I don't know if they misheard or just don't have anything less spicy, but keep that in mind. They don't give you white rice, so make sure you order enough for the soup. My tongue was completely numb so I can't comment much about how the food tastes. But my fiance had stomach cramps during the drive back home, and ended up getting sick. Overall, it seems that the owners didn't do sufficient preparation before opening the restaurant. They should have had the staff properly trained and rethought their operation procedures. As of right now, the place is a complete mess, which is a bad sign for a place that just opened and should have had things planned out. I won't come back because of the food poisoning, but in any case I would urge them to consider adopting the self-serve model of several other nearby eateries (Spoon House, Sushi Ichiban, etc.). It would significantly speed things up while not adding to their costs.--",

I got a tiny bit anxious when I saw no menu displayed anywhere, but the staff at the counter was kind and gave a small brochure menu that had  pictures on it of the pre-made orders (you could also make your own - cost was determined by how many items you put in it) and gave me his recommended item - the beef and noodle soup. Since I had no preconceived idea of what I wanted and I figured something basic would tell me a decent amount about their food quality and preparation, I decided to order just that.It didn't take that long for the soup to arrive, but it wasn't that busy when I had ordered, though a decent amount of people came in after me- not too many that it got crowded, but enough to tell me that this wasn't a place that got few customers. But I digress. The presentation was kind of unique - it came in a black pot/kettle with chopsticks, a fork for those not comfortable with the chopsticks, and what I think is a broth spoon . I thought it tasted quite good by itself. I added some spicy taro to it and I liked it better that way, but that's a personal preference. I finished it all, full and satisfied. Admittedly, it was a bit more than I would have liked to pay (9.40 is what I paid), but I had a good enough time and enjoyed what I had that I can deal with it. When I come back again, I'll try one of the custom dishes and see if that's any good, and if I remember, update this review.",

My husband and I gave it a try two days ago, and I have to say that I'm very disappointed about the food they offered. First, what you may want to know: I came from Sichuan, China where Chinese style spicy hot pot was originated from. What this restaurant's supposed to offer, spicy tang, is basically a fast food version of hot pot: you ordered food and they'd cook it for you. The most important factors for a good spicy tang are (1) plenty of choices of the food you can choose, and (2) the food has to be fresh and cooked just about right so it remains crunchy.Unfortunately, what this restaurant actually offers is none. Their choices of food are few and are frozen food that you can easily find at a Chinese/Korean grocery store. They don't offer potato slices, seaweed, or sweet potato noodles, which are considered must-haves in spicy tangs and they not hard to be found in Asian grocery stores. Their lotus root slices are basically frozen ones and taste horrible; they don't even bother to buy fresh lotus roots and cut them by themselves. To be honest, I think everyone can cook the exact food by themselves using the ingredient they can easily find in Asian grocery stores and don't need to spend $15+ at this place.I would suggest the owner to be more serious about opening a restaurant business. At least prepare fresh food and don't just buy frozen ones from super market. Also, I'm not sure whether the owner is aware of this, but the hot pot ingredients brought in Asian stores may contains pork or cow fat. I'd suggest you clearly mark it so that vegetarians or people with religious beliefs won't accidentally ate it.",

The restaurant is a very typical eat-in/take-out joint, with a nice lady coordinating the kitchen and taking the orders. As always, my order was the classic American-Chinese takeout standby of General Tso's Chicken. The food was ready in the promised 10 minutes, and I was happy to see that its container was practically bursting with chicken, broccoli, and fried rice. A good start!Once home, I eagerly unloaded a mix of victuals onto a plate and began to chow down. Unfortunately, the experience from here on was a bit of a disappointment. The meat was not at all spicy (despite the cute little chili pepper next to its name on the menu), and the flavor was more bitter than I'm used to. Maybe that's what they're shooting for, but the peculiar bitter/salty aftertaste didn't jibe too well with my taste buds.Granted, my opinion here is based entirely on one experience with one style of food. That being said, I've definitely had better. I'll see how the leftovers are after a night of sitting in the fridge, but the next time I have a craving for the good general's fried nuggets of fowl, I'll probably be looking elsewhere.",

Also, there was a piece of shrimp shell in my Ma Po Tofu....weird.The vegetable lo mein was pretty good, but honestly that's kind of hard to completely mess up.My boyfriend had the boneless spare ribs combo.  His eggroll was downright gross.  The insides were a uniform gray.  He asked me to take a bite of it to confirm how weird it was.  I sunk my teeth in and didn't even go any further...the texture and flavor was so disgusting.I'm disappointed by this place, especially since our food SMELLED so good (well, except for that eggroll...)",

Unfortunately the food is flat and rather boring.  There is an insane amount of variety on the menu to be overwhelming - this is typical of smaller Chinese places in my experience, but still disappointing.  Why not feature several things you do well, instead of an innumerable amount of things you do dreadfully?Had mixed steamed vegetables with a brown sauce over white rice.  Everything was absolutely scary - I had chicken, but it was absolutely unidentifiable as chicken.  Scary.",

Their crab rangoons actually contained crab (or krab...not sure but there was real protein in them). The lunch menu is really filling and reasonably priced ($5.95 for orange chicken, fried rice, soup, and an egg roll). The decor is really pretty and the wait staff was very friendly and knowledgable. I really recommend this place.",

While the cooking is not as great as Lai Lai or Golden Harbor, the dishes here are still prepared well with fresh ingredients. The best thing about the restaurant is that it is really the nicest Chinese restaurant around with Tang Dynasty also being comparable.The first thing that will stand out to anyone is the decor. It is comfortable, traditional, and hip at the same time. Next, the silverware is for fine dining and everything from the plates to the cups and teapot all bear the restaurant name. This is pretty unique for Chinese restaurants and gives the restaurant a bit of an upscale feeling. The service is also pretty good and we were able to order in English, Mandarin, and Cantonese all in the same meal.As for the food, they cooked common dishes like General Chicken and Sole Fillet with Chinese Greens well. Since a lot of restaurants around Champaign are in Mandarin or Szechuan style, it was nice to enjoy some dishes prepared Cantonese style. The noodles soups were light and enjoyable as well. The rice was a bit fluffier and most than most other local restaurants, suggesting that it wasn't prepared in enormous quantities.The prices were pretty good so I'm sure I'll return again soon.",

                "review": "As many other reviewers have already mentioned, this restaurant is operated by the same owners who manage the Rainbow Garden on Neil Street.  While the Neil Street location was fairly classy on the inside, this new venue is even more elegant and refined.  The servers wear starched white dress shirts and the furniture is made of heavy, dark wood.  I would definitely recommend it for serious business lunches during the day and romantic dates in the evening.  There is also a bar area that is probably supposed to serve as a cocktail lounge (with a TV), but I'm having a hard time imagining people coming to this place just for drinks.If you're looking for something fairly exotic or \"authentic,\" this would likely not be your place.  No baby squid or duck tongue on the menu.  Instead, you'll find the standard Americanized fare: sweet and sour chicken, beef and broccoli, fried rice, and egg rolls.  To compare the food to your average greasy take-out place is not a fair characterization, however.  All of the dishes are cooked with what tastes like better-quality ingredients.  Vegetables are cut and prepared artfully.  The sauces are a bit more nuanced in their flavor.  The skill in preparation and presentation is also reflected in their prices, as you can expect to pay around $8+ for most dishes (the upper range is around $15 for seafood).  For vegetarians, I would recommend the eggplant in garlic sauce.  The sauce is slightly spicy, slightly sweet and delicious by itself with some steamed rice.  The chicken and green beans is simple and tasty, the vegetables still slightly crisp.  It's also covered in garlic--yum!  All of the pork dishes are made with Chinese barbecue pork, which is a combination of sweet and smoky, and usually somewhat chewy.  Like the old location, the new Rainbow Garden offers lunch specials that are served until 2:30.  I still argue that this is the best lunch special in town, with each meal costing around $6 to $8.  The specials come with rice, soup, and an egg roll.  As with dinner, the quality of the food is above average compared to takeout places.  No slimy sauces and wilted vegetables.To summarize, this restaurant is for people who love Chinese food for its salty, sweet, and sticky sauces, but also want to eat this food in a more refined setting.",

The staff can be a bit aloof at times, but they're usually really busy around the lunch hour.

Chang's) with beautiful, modern decor and genuinely well-cooked food. The prices are definitely reflective of this, however they are definitely comparable with other restaurants of its caliber ($9-15 for entres).I choose the Honey Chicken with Roasted Cashews and Garlic, and it was by far one of the tastiest Chinese dishes I've ever eaten. The fried chicken pieces were large and perfectly crispy, and the sauce was a delicious mix of sweet and savory. I opted for the fried rice instead of white (extra $1.50) and it was an excellent addition, though I wish the portion was bigger to match the large size of the entre: it was easily enough for two people or generous left-overs. My girlfriend got the Beef and Broccoli and was also very pleased with her meal; she especially liked the broccoli, which I can affirm was perfectly prepared.The servers were also excellent, as they were both friendly and attentive. I went to Rainbow Garden for lunch not expecting the upscale atmosphere; it is definitely better suited for dinner with a date or group. I would highly recommend it to lovers of Americanized Chinese food and great dining.",

The ambiance was clean, quiet, and open.  Service was prompt and friendly.  The menu was extensive.  I don't know what constitutes authentic Chinese food but this is certainly delicious.  The Scallion Pancake was different than what I remember at Neil Street but still very good.  The chicken dish I had was excellent and ample.  Enough to share.  Will definitely be back again and again to try other dishes.  One thing I always wonder about is the tea.  Chinese restaurant tea is like movie popcorn: delicious but defies reproducing at home.  Also, my waiter was a magician.  I had left half my entree and most of my fried rice and asked for a box.  He returned with my food in the typical Chinese take-out white box but such a tiny one.  \"Is that everything?\"  \"Yes\"  Disbelief on my part, but when I dumped it later onto a plate at home, sure enough everything was there.  Magic!",

In fact this place has become the Chinese food I compare all others to now.  Everything I have ordered has been delish.  I especially enjoyed their Moo Shoo Veggie dish.  Yum.  They have very reasonable lunch specials.  Their take out is quick and hot!  The last time I ate there for lunch the servers were a bit \"off\", but I can see beyond that because the food is so good.",

The Hong Sue items and Spicy Beef Tendon noodle soup are great here.",

The place seems to get pretty packed and there is not much room inside, so I would expect a wait if you go during peak hours and want to eat in.  The service was OK, but the workers had a hard time speaking English, so I didn't know if my order was being taken correctly, and they had a really hard time explaining to me what certain dishes were.  The food was ok.  Nothing terribly wrong with it but I guess it did not just suit my fancy.  I disliked the taste of the sauce used in the entrees.  It had a very ketchup/hot sauce type of taste to it.  My parties entrees had similar sauces.   Some people might like this type of sauce, but I dislike it strongly.The prices are good, and you get a good sized portion of food.  It's not a bad restaurant by any means, I just don't prefer their recipes.  I will be sticking with Golden Harbor.UPDATE:  Forgot to mention they DON'T take credit cards.... A bit disappointing since we live in 2011....",

First, the food quality is indeed good. I chose the Mongolian beef with broccoli and the chicken with snow peas. The sauce was good (not too thick or not too soupy) and the broccoli was crisp and not too cooked. The chicken with snow peas was really a pleasant treat as well. The veggies rivaled the taste of the chicken (always a good sign). The food came out surprisingly quick and the price was almost as low as the lesser quality places nearby. I regret I did not take advantage of Lai Lai Wok more often while I was in grad school. The food was better but it is kind of far away from campus as well but I think the food is worth it for sure!",

During the summer and winter holidays from school, it seems like they are closed more often than not.  I only mention this because (due to all the glowing reviews) I have tried to eat there at least 7 times and only been successful twice due to them being closed.The entrees are good and the sauces are tasty.  Prices are a little on the high side to me - some of the meat dishes have so many vegetables it seems almost like filler.  I would like it if some of the dishes or sauces were a bit more heavily spiced, though.  For comparison, Empire and Woori Jib are a bit cheaper.  It's about the same price range as Golden Harbor and definitely faster, but I've never been blown away by a dish here like I have been at Golden Harbor.So that's pretty much it.  For campus, a little expensive.  It works if you really want an on-campus Chinese fix, and it is better than Cravings or Bo-bo China.  If you are meeting someone here, I'd call first to make sure they are actually open.",

After having a miserable experience visiting the campus filled with men who act like they're never seen a lady before and keep making animal noises... this was the highlight of my stay in the state! I got a cup of hot and sour soup first... really flavorful! It also had a nice spicy kick to it, which was refreshing change from the Americanized chinese restaurants I had been eating at. Also their portions are REALLY nice! The cup actually filled me up quite a bit, but I was hungry and I managed to munch on to my entree.LOVED the sliced chicken with garlic sauce and vegetable lo mein noodles! I typically don't like thick noodles, but my mom does so I went with it and I have no regrets about it. I think there was maybe a little too much sauce in the sliced chicken entree and it was a really strong flavor, but I was starving so it didn't phase me. They don't provide chopsticks unless you ask for them... or if you're Asian. lame! Their hot tea was really good too. I wasn't a huge fan of the seating because it kind of seemed like a fast food restaurant in the front and with the tables and there was a weird sign saying: \"Please clean your table for the next customer.\" Super confusing... Great experience though! I'm never ever going back to Illinois... but if I had to, then I'd eat here!",

One is in English only while the other is bilingual. The bilingual menu is the authentic one and note that the price is a little higher as well. The dish is huge though, usually enough to feed two or even three if you don't eat a lot. So, it evens out about the same price as other restaurants. Do try the salt and pepper tofu (and squid), it's my favorite. If fear factor is your passion, they serve innards too. Their crispy intestines are wonderful - the perfect dish to end your date (or not). =)",

Old furniture that belongs in the 80s, but if you are asian and understand home cooking this place will remind you of a home cook meal from home. Many of the dishes are nothing special and could be prepared at home, however students usually don't know how to cook or it is simply faster to come here for dinner. You either order at the desk or sit down and wait for the waitress to take your order. I ended up selecting the pork chop rice which I was surprised came with a egg and dice pork along with the fried pork. The size of the dish was very filling with ample rice. You also can get free tea from the machine. My wife had the salted fish/chicken with rice. A bit on the salty side, but still the chunks of fish were fried with the right crunch. Overall the portions are large and you can get a taste of home cooking with dishes not found in many asian restaurants.Pros: home style asian food, relatively inexpensive, no need to tip as you bus your own tray after eating, free hot teaCons: the inside decoration and furniture is very dated, confusing menu for non-chinese guestHidden deals:Daily special written on the board",

The food really upset my stomach (maybe because it was so oily?) and I was just disappointed all around. I also felt the prices were too high for what I got. I asked them to make the food very spicy...they gave me something very tame and \"American spiced.\" I ate in the restaurant which was a strange experience for someone coming in for the first time who does not know how it all works. You order at the front and then go and sit down and someone eventually brings your food. If you don't order a drink with your food (I assume they have other beverage options available but didn't order one because the food was so expensive), then you will eventually figure out that you have to get your own water or hot tea (offered free). You also bus your own table and then you pay at the end before you leave. I nearly walked out without paying simply because I was confused and forgot all about it since I was trying to figure out what to do with all of my dirty dishes.I went to Lai Lai because I had a craving for authentic tasting Dan Dan Noodles (Tan Tan) and I found some really great reviews for the dish at Lai Lai. Didn't know if there were good places in Champaign for this because the closest authentic Szechuan food I'd had at that point was in STL. However, when I got to the restaurant, I couldn't find the dish on the menu at all...couldn't even use deductive reasoning to find the dish per the ingredients. I told the cashier I wanted Dan Dan Noodles and gave a brief explanation of the dish that I was looking for because she looked at me like she had no idea what I was talking about. I thought we had it all figured out because she started nodding enthusiastically. Somehow I ended up with some sort of noodle soup that had a hard boiled egg in it. Not even close! I ate it because I honestly didn't know what I had. I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt in case it was a variation based upon some old family recipe. I also had some sort of spicy chicken (menu name, not actually spicy) that tasted a lot like Kung Pao Chicken. Good if you like KPC...I am not a fan of that either.I have a feeling I would have been more impressed with the American Chinese menu offerings but that's not what I went there for. Some restaurants have a secret separate authentic menu but that was not offered at Lai Lai. I would have given this place a better review if the total experience hadn't been totally awkward and the food hadn't upset my stomach. For authentic cuisine, I recommend Golden Harbor instead. I have been to Shanghai and Beijing and had many authentic items both home cooked and in restaurants here and there.",

However, it has large enough selection that I prefer it to many other Chinese restaurants in the area (there are lots!). Don't order what you know- branch out here, it's worth it. I would note their menu has an unspoken distinction between the Westernized and more authentic items, which is easy to find- simply note there are two chicken sections and the Westernized contains the familiar items like Kung Pao and Sesame. Try the other section. What keeps me coming back is the Taiwanese Salt and Pepper chicken I randomly ordered off the \"authentic\" section of the menu. It's crispy pieces of peppery chicken fried in ginger. It's wonderful and unlike anything I've ever had. The atmosphere is nothing special and the tea isn't as good as Mandarin Wok's, but the menu makes it worth it.",

I got spring rolls that were dripping and crab rangoon that were somehow greasy and dry cardboardy at the same time. No homemade sweet and sour sauce. The wonton soup was decent, a little light on flavor and the wontons fell apart instantly. I also got mixed sauteed vegetables.. they were cooked nicely and you get a load of rice, but the sauce is pretty heavy and salty. Since I have to eat out when I travel obviously, I ordered the sauteed vegtables thinking I could get something healthy to save for lunch when I wouldn't have time to go out for lunch the next day. Nope. Not great for eat in if you travel and have to eat out a lot, since I have to go to a restaurant all the time, I want to sit somewhere nice if I am going to stay in the place while I eat. As a note I got takeout, but that is a tip I always wish I had ahead of time regardless.",

I've been coming here ever since I landed in this town about 5 years ago; and the keyword that sticks out in my mind when describing this place is: consistency. No matter how many times I come here the food is always delicious and never lets me down. With so many different, competing Chinese restaurants just in Campustown alone, this place must be something special for me to say it's my favorite in the area, thus proving that not all Chinese places are the same.The food I feel is the most authentic Chinese food I've had ever since moving down, and also provides the best quality food, comparing right on top with my other favorite Chinese restaurant back up north in the suburbs (China House, Schaumburg, IL).  The food is very fresh and stands out as being the only place I've been to on campus that doesn't come out greasy and flavor masked in an oily feeling in the mouth. The flavor pops with every dish and portion size is pretty generous.  My favorite dish is anything from the pan fried noodle section. The noodles come out perfect, and as the sauce sinks in, you get a nice balance of crispy and soft-flavor soaked noodles.  It also comes with a hefty amount of vegetables (bak choy is a plus) and lot of protein (depending on which you got).  I always surprise whoever I come with because they are always thrown off by the portion size (which is huge).  Some other dishes that stand out are the Orange chicken (as my friend, who I brought, said it was the best he had in the area).  Another note, the wait staff is pretty on or off.  Usually when I go, the only time I see the 'waiter' or owner is when they bring out the food. You have to get your own water/tea and ask for additional items (ie. more rice) at the counter.  It's not too bad, since it only takes an extra second to do all that.  Plus it's unlimited tea, and that makes up for it.  Overall, really good Chinese food and definitely recommend this place to everybody in the area.  Hopefully, you'll have the same experience I had.",

But service has been prompt, questions answered, the check brought promptly when I asked for it right away, and to go containers provided. Portion sizes are generous, but with vegetable dishes costing over $10 they ought to be!IMHO, either this place or one across the street provides decent but not exciting Chinese. Pick based on time of day (dim sum across the street, but only through 3pm) and which is more crowded.",

Simple, convenient, and not too difficult to eat. The noodles were a bit disappointing (lo mein came out a bit.. hm, drier than I thought it would be, almost like the noodles didn't cook properly).",

The service wasn't that great -- we sat at the table for fifteen minutes before someone realized we were there and gave us menus and waters.  When our food arrived, some of us had to wait twenty more minutes for theirs to arrive, by then, most of us were done with our portions! Our glasses of water were also sitting empty for awhile (water refilling is a vital part of my ratings).The food was superb, though.  We all sampled each other's food and not one dish was to my disliking.  YUM!  Definitely would come back here on a future visit.",

He told us this place hands down was the best Chinese, and for paying almost nothing since we got lunch special prices, this place is awesome! I wish they had this in Boston!We also got the tofu and vegetables soup which was flavorful and packed with tons of tofu which we loved. And the squid with black bean sauce was also a hit, although we felt the squid was cooked a little differently texture wise than what we had before, the black bean sauce with it was just so tasty, but the squid I dunno about. And they have unlimited hot tea here too! It is all serve yourself which we didn't quite get at first since none of the signs were written in English, but we figured it out eventually.One tip (literally): we put some tip money in the jar on our way out and they were so so so incredibly thankful! I guess people must not tip here usually? Please tip them people!",

We ordered: home style tofu, short ribs, and orange chicken.The home style tofu was perfect and had a very nice consistency while the tofu was not simply deep fried and then stir fried - it was cooked properly (something that many restaurants could learn from - leathery tofu is no fun.)The short ribs were awesome! Nice sauce, and the meat was falling off the bone. Good stuff!The orange chicken was crispy and spicy and included the elusive but much wanted \"candied orange peel\" - caramelized the way I like it :-)It was nice that we could hop up and get refills on water and hot tea - I've seen few places that will do this. I've been ignored plenty while eating at  Chinese and Vietnamese restaurants - I don't think it's rudeness - it's usually that the kitchen is busy and the restaurant is understaffed.We ate late, and were one of three tables. Our service was prompt and good. I think that sometimes you might have to get someone's attention to place an order - not the end of the world by any means for me based on my experiences eating in many restaurants in Chicago.We had leftovers for 2 meals to take home. It's nice that the take-out boxes are easy to find and are self-service. I hate waiting for boxes and hate even more when my food is taken back to the kitchen to be boxed (leaving food behind and anyway I like to see my food while it is boxed.)I'd give it a try if you are a student or are just in town for a few days.",

Lai Lai Wok is supposed to be more Taiwanese, where as Mandarin Wok is supposed to be more mainstream. I can't tell the difference since they have many of the same dishes. I do like Lai Lai Wok's soups and noodle varieties. The other dishes are also great and is useful for dining family-style. This place is a good bang for your buck.",

My favorite dishes here are the \"3 Cup Chicken\" aka \"San Bei Ji\", the tofu dishes such as \"Ma Po Do Fu\", and the snowfish that comes out over a flame.The owner is always very accommodating, but keep in mind that I place my table reservations at least two weeks ahead of the dinner.On the days we have the dinner, the owner even let us bring some of our own celebratory big bottles of sake. Although at the expense of her restaurant (no liquor license :X), we really appreciated the gesture of accommodating guests!Even my super-white Illinois-raised friends and classmates all agree that Lai Lai has the most authentic Chinese/Taiwanese food in the area. Like the restaurant name implies (Lai Lai = Come Come), come for great food!P.S. I find it funny that lots of the reviewers are from California, yayyy",

We sat down to eat inside and began to peruse the menu which has over 1000 items to choose from.Within 2 minutes we were approached by a waitress and asked if we had any questions, which we did not.After that we were ignored for 15 minutes until we all closed our menus and the waitress immediately came over (maybe that's how it works?).I had the sliced pepper steak which was #644 I believe. For $6.99 it was a pretty decent sized portion. The quality however, was typical of cheap Chinese food, poor. The peppers and onions did not taste fresh at all, but I did still like them. The sauce used was pretty tasty as well as the rice it was served with. Overall, kind of salty, but hey it is Chinese food, right?My friends ordered a seafood Ho-fun and a bok choy and pork, which they said was good.I'd like to try some other menu items. I think Lai Lai is better than Cravings and Chopsticks, for sure.",

Yet, when I finally got to try it, it was nothing exciting. I ordered a fried rice, yet it seemed dark which may have been the high amount of soy sauce they put in it. It was definitely a bit too salty. If I had better options, I would definitely go elsewhere. But because of the limited choices in Chinese food in Champaign, this place will have to do. I'd still go here rather than Panda Express I have to say.",

You would think fried rice tastes the same everywhere but the spices that Evo used and the gigantic pieces of chicken and shrimp made it out of this world.Fast forward to a few weeks ago. We took a trip to see the campus and made sure to stop at Evo. Something has really happened to the quality of the food. Except for the bubble tea, nothing really tasted the same as when we last went to Evo, and we were pretty disappointed. If we still lived in the area, we would still go to Evo for bubble teas and the occasional meal but it would not be the regular restaurant-of-choice that it once was.",

I recommend Banana, Taro, or Coconut and you have to order it as \"banana snow with pearls.\" Shake it up before you plunge the straw in, and try not to suck it all down in the car before you get back to work. I for one, have always devoured the whole thing before I can get five minutes back across town. Pitiful, but incredible. Oh, and don't expect them to be nice.",

(She saw me when I came in) asked if they had the lunch special she said no (understandable since its the weekend ) . Told her J needed to then look at the menu. Looked at the menu for 10 minutes but took another 15 for her to notice me (she was right there just making tea ) . Then told me I had to wait 40 min for a general tsos chicken and BBQ fried rice...walked out. Not going back.",

I used to work doing refrigeration and commercial appliance repair in the area. This particular Panda location always had the cleanest and best maintained kitchen I've seen in the CU area, and I've been in a lot of them. Color me impressed.",

It was a very disappointing.A friend and I had decided to go because we wanted to try their dim sum. I had heard from friends that it was great. We walked in about 12:15 and did not leave until about 2:30. In my opinion, that is way too long for an hour lunch break.We walked in and it was very hectic. The waitresses were yelling and the tables were still dirty from the customers who had left. We went up to the counter to order, but she told us to sit down with our menu. We saw a bunch of people walk in and order at the counter so we filled in our sheet and brought it up. At this point it was about 12:30 before she even took our sheet because the waitress were taking care of the customers who had just walked in. So we sat there and waited, and waited and waited. 30 minutes had gone by and nothing. 40 minutes. Nothing. We were very upset because we only had a short lunch break. About 43 minutes later, our first dish came out. Slowly, our little dim sum dishes came out. One by One. Our dishes were being thrown on the table without care and the waitress just left without telling us what it was. We went up to get some hot tea as well and both containers were completely empty. We to complain and the manager said that this was a new girl and she didn't really have a handle on things yet. Our last dish came about 45 minutes later from our first dish. A few of the dim sum dishes were really tasty, but it did not make up for lack of management and service skill. I do not think that I'll ever be returning.",

The peking pork was fried to perfection and the sauce was very tasty.  They have updated their menus so that the good stuff can be read in English now.  Their dim sum is pretty standard items, but the only real place to go in Champaign, myself I would probably wait till I get back to Chicago for that.The down side of this place is their are two waitress that also work in the kitchen, everything is self serve the tea, drinks, even your utensils.  So do not come here expecting great service, but all in all the most authentic chinese restaurant in Champaign!!",

It's of course, a no frills, plastic fork kind of place, but if you order off their Chinese menu, you will not be disappointed. Their Spicy Pig Intestine stew is probably the best dish I have ever eaten. Every time I go, I take an order with me.  When I am eating it in Chicago, it is so good it makes me want to move back.  C-U has always had better asian food than Chicago, but this dish, and it's always a little different, sends me to the moon.  I can't speak for their Sesame Chicken or their Egg Foo Young, and if I was as talented as the person in that kitchen, I would be insulted seeing that kind of order come up.  That being said, they should probably alter the ambience, but hell, they are mainly existing to serve Chinese students who want authentic chinese food,  not people who want a fine dining experience. As long as that dish stays good, I will always come back.  They have wonderful food and I like that the prices are lower because there are no waiters or flatware.  I would pay 30 dollars for the Intestine dish.  I am glad I can still get it for 12.",

We were craving pho, and normally we go to Cravings for that but he had come here with his boss and swore it was better here. Noting the couple in front of us eating the beef version of pho I got excited. We ordered the seafood pho.When it came I noticed there was something immediately wrong: the noodles looked suspiciously like Top Ramen egg noodles instead of rice noodles but I dug in cos I was so hungry. My boyfriend was a little annoyed since he had gotten something completely different. It also had no garnish (bean sprouts, basil), no lime, and there was no oil that normally comes in the soup. When we inquired the lack of garnish or lime, we were informed by a very nervous waitress that our pho was \"special\". We then asked for srirarcha (sp?) and got a tiny dollop of it. All in all we paid $16 for beef Top Ramen with seafood floating in it. It was very salty and unpleasant. I felt disgusted that I actually ate half since I was so hungry.Multiple theories as to why we were treated this way. The couple in front of us had the beef pho and it had the garnish and the lime/oil and rice noodles.1) We didn't look Asian enough: I'm Filipino Italian (look at my profile picture) and my boy is Filipino but could pass for Latino sometimes. They were too cheap to serve us the real thing or thought they could get away with serving us the ramen since we \"didn't know any better anyway\".2) They were out of ingredients and were too lazy to bother telling us  and offer alternatives or a refund.3) A combination of number 1 and 2.I guess it serves us right for going into a Chinese restaurant for pho but Cravings serves multiple Asian dishes as well and they got it right. What made us the most angry is the fact that the Asian couple in front of us got exactly what they wanted and we left unsatisfied. My boy swears he got good soup there but his boss is more Asian looking and could be the reason why they got it right. NEVER AGAIN STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!",

The dim sum isn't bad for somewhere not in Chicago, but it's obvious that most of everything is frozen and re-steamed. Prices aren't bad either, about the usual prices for dim sum. They might be the only place on campus that makes real fruit slushies with boba (Evo uses syrup, yuck!). Other than that, the regular food is nothing special and rumor has it this place is closing soon since no one ever goes there anymore. But that's just a testament to the ownership and the so-so food. If you want dim sum you can always go to Saigon.",

What! Who does that! It's amazing!I had their snow pea leaves stir fried in garlic today and eggplant in garlic sauce + chicken. both were great. although, i think the snow pea leaves could've been cooked a bit more some of it was tough. The eggplant was delicious and I was looking at all the dishes around me everything looks pretty good. Forget rainbow garden - come here for real Chinese food.

Had I not asked she would never had told me. Second time, My friend wanted to come here. The owner asked whether I want pork belly or port tenderloin for a dish. I said belly, and a magical one dollar was added to my bill. Then I specially asked whether the rick comes with dishes or not. She said yes and secretly added another $2 to my bill. When I confronted her, she said the rice was $1 per person. At this point, I was beyond pissed by this dishonest act. WTF! Hell I will NEVER EVER return to this restaurant. I sincerely hope it goes out of business and someone honest can takeover this prime Green street location.",

It's not getting five stars because you get less amount of food for the same price compared to four years ago. I guess this is predictable because of the inflation and increase in cost.

If you're not sure what it is, don't hesitate to ask the owners... plus, you could always close your eyes, point at a random dish on the wall, and see what surprise arrives at your table (I suggest trying this only if you don't have food allergies =P)!While they do have lunch specials here, the dishes tend to be over-Americanized (like orange/sweet-sour chicken, general tsao's, etc.), but cheap.As a tip, the owners stock their kitchen on Mondays so for the freshest ingredients, try Mandarin on a Tuesday.   Of course, that's not to say that their food is any less on other days!If you come here often enough and get to know the owners, they often throw in an extra dish or two for free =]Mandarin Wok reminds me of the Chinese restaurants back home.",

We were actually heading over to Ihop, but saw that Mandarin Wok had dim sum, so we stopped in.I've never experienced this type of service before - or lack there of. They bring the food out to you and plates, but everything else is up to you. Get your own drinks (chrysanthemum tea, jasmine tea, or water), your own utensils, your own sauce (they had packaged soy sauce and sweet and sour sauce, usually not what I use for dim sum), and you have to get up and order at the cashier.They should really put a sign up or make sure people know to order, a family walked in while we were half way done with our dim sum, and they just sat there. The girl who was working wasn't doing anything important but she didn't even walk over to them, give them a menu, or anything until the man called for her.Anywho, the dim sum just reaches the bare minimum for passing off as an okay meal. Perhaps in a small town it's good, but it doesn't compare to Chinatown in the Chi.There wasn't a lot of options, only about 25 items. My favorite thing for dim sum is shrimp crepes and turnip cake. Both of which were disappointing! The shrimp crepe only had two small pieces of shrimp. The turnip cake was just off, seemed like it wasn't cooked right.  The shui mai and shrimp dumpling were small, but it tasted fine.Not entirely saddened by this experience because at least it wasn't expensive. Around $7 to share 10 dishes. I don't think we left a tip, since we really didn't have a waitress/waitor.",

Far exceeding the likes of legitimate Vietnamese establishments in the Champaign-Urbana area. I would venture to say that it rivals the pho I get back home in the San Francisco Bay Area, but that's probably because my pho-addicted brain craves any substitute.. although the Yelper in me looks for quality and authenticity :]Soup base was flavorful, noodles chewy, meat offering varied and delicious. And they even bring the bean sprouts, herbs, and jalapeno slices.You will not be disappointed coming here for a hot steaming bowl of pho. If you've never had pho in your life, consider trying it at Mandarin Wok a first step to something incredible.*Caveat*: only order the beef pho, as according to another Yelper the seafood pho is whack.",

I am usually not a huge fan of these, but theirs are pretty decent and sweeter than I remember. 3) shrimp crepes - pretty good...I would have liked more shrimp though 4) chicken feet - cooked really well; these were pretty big and more filling then I think is typical 5) Spare Ribs - they came in a sauce that I can't really remember the name of, but it was good and not too salty 6) Turnip Cake - probably my favorite, but I always love it :) 7) Congee - this came with a pork sausage which was tasty. I was getting pretty full at this point, but the congee was good enough to keep me going... The place also has really good jasmine and chrysanthemum tea, which is refreshing on a chilly day :)The only thing I wish they did here was use the carts, but it is a small place and they serve other items then Dim Sum so I understand...",

I had my Taiwanese friend make the choices and he didn't think much of what was served. All in all, a disappointing experience. There are lots of Chinese restaurants in C-U and some of them are good!

This was a glorified road trip pit stop for my family, and it was everything it promised to be -- efficient and delicious.Golden Harbor pretty much took the most hated part of Chinese food -- the service -- and put it upon the diner.  They do charge a very small \"seating fee\" (I think it's $1 a person), and for that they bring you all your dishes and clear the table, but you're responsible for ordering at the counter and bringing your own pots of tea to the table, along with any other beverages.  Fine by me, I love not chasing down servers for glasses of water.Since my parents are Chinese, we ordered off the wall and got the following:809 (I think), Crispy Tofu - So, so good.  I thought that sauce would be overwhelming but it was the perfect complement, not too sweet but also not too salty.  Do order this when you're with a larger group as I can imagine this isn't very good as leftovers.745, Sea Cucumber with Beef Tendon - This is an uber Chinese dish but I loved the fatty beef tendons (sounds grosser than it tastes). 561, Sliced Lamb with Ginger and Scallion - I think lamb is the new pork.  Gamey, but still tender. We also ordered a beef with flat noodle dish (in Chinese:  gan chao niu he) that is not on the menu, but they whipped it up anyways.I would recommend going through the website menu first before going there so that you're not overwhelmed with the range of choices.",

Forget all the lower reviews that complaining about busing your own table, getting your own silverware, drinks, etc.  The food is amazing and authentic.  Don't order off the American Chinese menu!  Pick a meat/vegetable and a description that sounds good.  If you want to know the difference ask.  Come early or late for a better chance of a table.  Some of our favorites include:  Steam Pork Buns, Crispy Tofu(not good leftover), Spicy Eggplant, Salt and Pepper Anything(though ask for light on salt),  BBQ Duck or Spicy Duck, and their soups, one was a spicy pork with wide noodles, really good and huge.",

We went for an early dinner and did not have to wait for a table. We ordered our entrees and they were brought to us very quickly. Great portion sizes and *amazing* taste. Additionally, the staff were very nice and attentive, and we were in and out in no time at all! This is one place that I would bring my asian grandparents to in a heartbeat.

Don't order it!! But I did enjoy the hot boiled fish and cumin lamb.You do have to pay for everything at the counter when you order tho, which makes it seem more like counter service food rather than an actual restaurant.

We ordered 6 entrees for 8 people, but I think we could have finished a 7th entree if we had it.My favorite things that we ordered were the fried basil chicken, the crispy tofu, and the pork buns. The basil chicken was nicely spicy and the texture of the breaded meat was wonderful. The crispy tofu was in a sweet sort of sauce that I really enjoyed. We assembled the pork buns ourselves because they were served as a plate of meat, a container of buns, and a plate of garnishes (crushed peanuts, some sort of veggies, and cilantro). The menu is very extensive, so be prepared to spend some time looking through it (though you really can't go wrong with the basil chicken or crispy tofu!) When you arrive at the restaurant, you take a table number, menu, and ordering slip to a table of your choice. Then after you decide what you want, you bring your order slip up to the counter and pay. It works best for a group if everyone brings cash to split the cost because I'm not sure that they allow separate checks from one table. Then someone will bring your food to your table. Tea is free, and you can simply serve yourself. At the end of your meal you clear your own dishes, or else pay a few dollars to have them bus your table for you.",

They cater to all different styles of Chinese food.PROs- They have a thoroughly comprehensive menu. Whatever you can think of in terms of Chinese food, they can make it.- The lady behind the counter is AWESOME at catering to what you want. If you describe it in half mandarin / half English or even pure English, she can tell you what you're looking for. If you're looking for a suggestion of what to eat, she can list off a bunch of dishes and ask you if you like it spicy / non-spicy or a certain style.CONs- You have to clean up your own dishes. It's a place where they are so busy they just don't have time to do it. If you don't enjoy doing this aspect of it, there are lots of other places around town that will do it for you.- The wait can be a long time. If you go during peak hours which is basically the major meal times on weekends, you can expect to wait from 30 minutes to an hour just to order your food and then an additional half hour to get your food. They only have a couple of chefs so it takes awhile to get your food, but it's usually delicious.- Again, you're going to pay $$ for it and you're not going to fill up completely until you spend about $10-15 per person.- The atmosphere is noisy so it's not exactly a great place to go for a quiet date.I typically order:- Crispy Tofu - a soft tofu on the inside but crunchy on the outside that comes with a garlic sauce and green onions on top.- The fish fillets with garlic sauce - just as it's described, most people that like seafood like this.- Three cups Chicken - if you ask for it extra spicy and like spicy stuff, people generally like it.The food quality goes beyond any measure of any local Chinese restaurant in the Champaign-Urbana area making this place WELL worth it if you're looking for chinese food in the area.",

I mean BOOK!  its so extensive i didn't think there was anyway  that much food could be in one place!  lol  I cant remember what i ordered, but it was really good, chicken with chiles maybe? There doesn't seem to be anything sweet on the menu :-(  Its pricey, but a total experience worth having!  I thought i was back in China town in NYC!  Loved it, you gotta go, but be prepared to spend 30 mins looking at the menu before you get in line to order your food.  Get your own beverage passed the cashier, and find a seat.  They have Extra large tables like in real chinese restaurants, with a lazy susan in the middle to share.  Sharing is the cornerstone of chinese eating, love that!",

Since I will probably never visit here again, I also ordered a small portion of the Taiwanese Salt and Pepper Chicken. It wasn't as good as the tofu, but certainly flavorful. I was already full from the large portion of tofu, so that may have affected my judgement.  The staff was very pleasant and helped me order even though I didn't follow the simple directions posted at the door.  If this is authentic Chinese food, I am a big fan!The Jasmine tea was free and lovely. The amount of food for $20 could have fed two hungry adults.UPDATE: After dinner I got very sick to my stomach...  I'm not sure if it was MSG or something else in the food.  Although the crispy tofu tasted very good, I'm downgrading to four stars based on the lasting after effects and the mediocre Salt and Pepper Chicken.",

I also love the Crispy Tofu or the Crispy Eggplant, perfectly fried and spiced, served with a delicious sauce and herbal garnish.  I've tried many of the dishes, especially those in the chicken domain, and have never had a bad dish.  I come back to my favorites over and over again.  The freshness of the vegetables and each dish could not be better.Sophie, who takes orders, is friendly and smart, with an amazing memory.

Fortunately for the students, these restaurants cook well enough that there is no immediate need to run to Chinatown to enjoy good Chinese cooking. Don't miss the tea smoked chicken here.

                "review": "While Golden Harbor lacks the atmosphere and service of many \"fine dining\" restaurants in town, it compensates with over 100 different dishes brimming in flavorful sauces and expertly prepared meats, vegetables, and other Chinese specialties.  The restaurant serves everything from popularized American dishes (e.g., General Tso's chicken, fried rice) to more \"exotic,\" authentic cuisine (e.g., frog legs, \"stinky\" tofu).Of the items I've tried so far, I've really enjoyed the (legendary) crispy tofu and crispy beef in pepper sauce.  The dumplings were a little disappointing as they seemed like a standard pre-made frozen product rather than something made in-store (though honestly, I think most Asian places in town serve pre-made dumplings).  Unfortunately, they also seem to run out of leafy vegetables fairly often, so consider yourself lucky if you have the opportunity to sample the traditional Chinese vegetables. The woman who usually works the register speaks English very well and can be helpful if you are overwhelmed by the menu options.  Even though the menu is translated into English, the names of dishes are not always very descriptive (\"What's the difference between spicy chicken and chicken in hot sauce?\"), so you can just ask her for advice.For vegetarians, there is a clearly marked section of veg-friendly dishes on the back of the English menu.  This guarantees that your Chinese dinner will be free of chicken broth or other cleverly-masked animal products.  However, given the limited number of items listed in this section, I would also encourage vegetarians to browse the rest of the menu.  For whatever reason, there are veg-friendly dishes (marked with a cute cabbage icon) in the regular menu that are not included in the vegetarian section.The only disadvantage of Golden Harbor is that it does not yet offer a take-out or online version of their menu.  While they still allow customers to pick up food to go, you will probably have to place your order in-person at the restaurant, or already know what you want if you plan to call in advance.",

The standout food at Golden Harbor is authentic, homestyle Taiwanese dishes. Also for those who are interested, this is the rough history of the owners' time in the area:(Pre-2000 - 2004)  Mandarin Wok(2005 - ? )               Cravings (Drastically different from its current state)(? - early 2010)       The Wok in Mahomet(Mid-2010 -     )       Golden HarborI'm in the area approximately once an year and this is on my must-try list (along with Jarling's Custard Cup). I left the area in 2005 and the owner still recognizes me... Ask all the alumni that have passed through the doors of the original Mandarin Wok and they'll tell you in all of their worldly travels, they haven't found a crispy tofu as good as the one here. Go easy on the service and ambience - the food is worth it.A friend made reservations for me since it sometimes gets busy. You get a table # and look for your table # on arrival and use it to place your order. With each order, you get a big bowl of rice (based on the number of diners), plates, fortune cookies, and chopsticks. I think the prices may have gone up over the years, but I guess certain items are harder to come by in Champaign. The overwhelming Chinese menu on the wall is supposedly fully translated into English (look for the menus on the lefthand side). I'm not sure how complete the translated menu is. And for those who prefer Chinese-American takeout food, I believe those items are still available. You don't have to tip because you're expected to clean up your own table.My order:809 Crispy tofu (let me know if you figure out the recipe to the sauce)204 Spicy basil chicken balls876 Chinese cabbage (gotta have some veggies!)2000 Chicken rolls",

Don't worry though, everything they did was for the better, and the place is still as good as ever.  I will note the things that have changed though.  They have new menus now, since the old ones were all scribbled on, torn, falling apart.  The Mandarin menu is still up on the wall, but they now have a beautifully done full menu in English (feels like a textbook almost!) that contains all the dishes in English.  My favorite though is that they also now offer a smaller, \"Americanized\" menu, with the stuff Non-Asian ethnicities are likely to expect at a restuarant.  Even this though is still 100s of choices.  Second, you now have to pay a table cleaning fee.  Before, you were expected to clear your table (just remove all dishes and trash to bins located all around the restaurant) but I guess too many people were just leaving their dishes and no tips either.  Hell, I often would leave tips even when we cleaned off our tables because the staff is always so nice.  But yea, it's like 50 cents I think per person, and they now clean your table off at the end, so it's actually very reasonable.  Still no tips expected, you just pay the fee on your bill.   We still clean our table off for courtesy, but you don't have to.  You also get your table number after your order now.  Also, lot's of people will stand up front and look through their menus, but we always just take them back to our table first and look while also grabbing a table we want.  :D  All and all, the food is still amazing, and I've never had a bad dish here.  I'm definitely starting to get to the point though where I have found so many excellent choices that are so superbly good, I just stick to them.  As always, the staff is super friendly and courteous too.  The front counter lady, I believe her name is Tina, is one of the nicest people I know.  Seriously, she puts a smile on my face, and I just want to give her a big hug.  She treats everyone like family, and it makes me so happy to know there are people still like that out in the world when there is also so much bad going on.All and all, this place is still top notch, and do yourself a favor and check it out if you haven't already. Pro Tip:  Go with a large party and share your platters.  Even the small size meals are enough to feed two people heartily.  It's a ton of fun though to just have everyone order different stuff, and pick a little bit of everything!",

Over 1000 meal choices, and everything is translated into English from the old menu.  There are your normal \"Americanized Chinese\" meals like sweet and sour pork, and beef and broccoli.  I assume they're pretty good, but I'm more excited about the more exotic meals.I've had three cup chicken, stewed goat (with skin), eggplant and garlic, yellow bean fish, crispy tofu, Peking (or Fire) duck, peppered beef, squid with garlic sauce here, and salt and pepper squid.  I also had the soft pork buns, though those may have another name now.  There are so many more options, I've hardly scratched the surface.  The Peking duck in particular is amazing - fried to crispy, crackly perfection and served with a thick dipping sauce.  It's just awesome. The crispy tofu is also excellent, and is served with a sweet sauce and cilantro leaves.  I'd say it is the best in town.  The yellow bean fish is pretty consistently good, as well.  The food has always been good.  The prices are higher than what you see at a lot of Chinese places, but you get a lot of food and it is very good quality.  You get a big bowl of rice to eat with your food, too.  Generally, my girlfriend and I get a couple meals out of a visit here, where we get two entrees and usually pay about $30.  The dining room definitely does fill up, especially during the school year.  I'd give yourself some extra time to eat here, especially at dinner.I guess the ordering system confused some people to start with, but I don't mind it.  They recently streamlined it, too, along with improving the previously kind of Spartan decor.  You just write down the number of people in your party and what meals you want, pay,  and then they bring it to you.  Simple and easy.  You do have to clean up your own dishes (unless you want to pay a little extra) but they don't take tips, so it kind of balances out.This place has pretty much become my first stop for a Chinese-type food craving.  They're friendly, the options are immense, and the food is very good.  I was able to take my sister's vegetarian boyfriend here no problem, and the large sizes mean you can feed more people more affordably than if you're just going by yourself or with a date.Highly recommended!",

I recommend #514 the Szechuan Water Fish Fillet, if you like spicy food. The Kung Pao Chicken, Kung Pao Shrimp and Garlic Shrimp are also good if you are not a huge fan of spicy food, but want some heat. The side of beef fried rice from the menu is huge and is not the same type of fried rice that comes with as a side dish of a meal. Order it if you like fried rice - this fried rice is of better quality.There is a huge Chinese menu on the wall, but have no fear, they now have a large translated Chinese menu and a Americanized Chinese menu, both in English. This is not a place to go to expect the fake Americanized Oriental Chinese atmosphere with Chinese music playing in the background, but is a restaurant that actually serves authentic Chinese food. Like most restaurants in China, it is order, pay, and be served with little interruption from the staff after the food in delivered. Do not a fancy Red Americanized Chinese atmosphere, and you will not be disappointed. As this is one of the most frequented local restaurants for international students from both China and Taiwan, if you like authentic Chinese food, you will not be disappointed.",

For about 90% of those 364 days, I would say I actively dislike Chinese. For one magical day, however, I must get my Chinese fix.Today was that day. A friend recommended Golden Harbor as the place to go and thus we went. Honestly, it's not your traditional Chinese restaurant. In fact, I would call it a cafeteria where they bring your food to you. You don't really see a server except when the food comes. You clear your own table or you pay them to do it. It's kind of absurd how it's all organized.At the same time, it's Chinese food I would eat more than once a year. I actually liked it and since Golden Harbor didn't really score any points for ambiance or any of that cute stuff, it's four stars on the basis of food alone. In addition, when the rice cooker crapped out, the manager apologized for the inconvenience and hooked us up with lo mein instead. It's a little more expensive and a little more complicated to order but I would say the food is more than worth it.",

I write down numbers that I like and order the same items later. Tina, who works there, does a GREAT job deciphering what I've ordered before as well. I've been known to say \" I had this great chicken dish last time but I don't know what it is.\" I'll describe what it looks like and she's like \"Ding! I know what it is.\" Tina has also given me great recommendations as well. More than once she's said \"If you like X, give Y a try!\" I end up ordering both X and Y and Y always becomes my new favorite dish! My favorites are:1) Potato strings with green peppers2) Snow fish with soy3) Crispy Tofu 4) Desert PorkI love that I always have leftovers for at least two more meals after eating at Golden Harbor!

They have 3 versions of menus here: an American menu, a translated authentic Chinese menu, and a menu in full Chinese written on the wall. Though I could be wrong, I could not find all the items listed in Chinese on the wall in the translated Chinese menu. Your best bet is to bring someone with you who reads characters if you are looking to get the full experience. I got the following:sesame balls: These were not as large as I hoped though they arrived at my table hot and crunchy and the red bean paste oozed out in exactly the way I hoped.Crispy tofu: these are large chunks of soft tofu which have been breaded and friend with a slightly sweet sauce on top. Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. Very nice.Spicy basil chicken: this seems to me a variant of orange chicken in that it is similarly fried and smothered in sticky sauce. A little too American for my taste though it seemed to have great reviews here on Yelp.The best thing I ate: a whole spicy fish. This was one of the items that I couldn't find in the translated menu but was on the wall. I think it was number 2099 though a double check with the cashier wouldn't hurt. This fish was deep fried and covered in a spicy soy sauce based sauce that included hot chilis. The frying left the small bones of the fish completely edible and slightly crunchy and paired with the tenderness of the fish meat in the middle....*drrroooollllllsssssssss*Finally, most things are DIY such as ordering at the cashier and grabbing your own chopsticks and napkins as well as filling up your own tea kettle. The busboys are ever-present and eager to help should you have any misshap you can't handle (my brother spilled a cup of water and they cleaned that up like lightening).  And just like in China, tip is not expected here. They just charge $0.50/person to clean the tables.I am ecstatic that I ate here and cannot wait to come back again!",

I know that the woman who works the front counter there is great at interpreting what you want and helping you order, but I wasn't expecting such thorough service on the phone! She made sure I was ordering exactly what I wanted (and asked me if I wanted the authentic Chinese recipe- of course I do!) Then, she offered to have it ready in ten minutes, or hold the order until a time of my choosing.I got there and met the nice lady who took my order, who immediately recognized me. She greeted me, and I paid in cash, receiving a  small discount! The entire time, she was smiling and making me feel very welcome. She gave me my food, which was all ready to go, and said \"enjoy, it's all nice and hot.\" A huge component of my job is customer service, and this experience was A+ customer service.Of course, as we all know, the food was amazing! My \"lunch\" portion for $7 was enough food for me to fill up now, and still save half for whenever I want it later. I've been around to the other Chinese restaurants in the area that have very good reviews, and they are good, but not quite as good as the Golden Harbor.The only negative point is that it is hard for me to justify ordering the same thing I always get each time, as I know whatever I order will be fantastic!",

If you look at the menu closely you will notice there is no fresh fish or seafood items which are staples of asian food, however you will not be disappointed with the selection. They have a little of everything from the different provinces of China. Your head will spin when you walk in as you try to figure out what to order. Your best bet is to check out the menu at home online before going to the restaurant itself. You order cafeteria style and write down the numbers of your order. There is no gratuity which is nice, but don't expect the busboy who double as servers to help you out. There main job is to dump the food off at the table and take your number back. There is a fee of 1 dollar for each person for clean up and free tea. The cashier is quite friendly ad does not get overwhelmed even when the line is super long. We ended up trying a variety of dishes which you can see from the pictures. Here is a quick run down:1. Smoked tea duck- sort of salty and dry unfortunately, but still tasty2. Beef ribs with some sort of glaze- deep fried and a bit dry, but plenty of sweet sauce over it3. Glazed pork- a hybrid dish that is similar to orange chicken. Again a bit dry on the underside4. Fish fillet with veggies- tasty and a lighter dish. Cooked well, but the white fish is your typical asian stir fry fish5. Salted egg coated shrimp- the egg was not salty at all, but the shrimp were cooked well and crunchy6. Soup dumplings- pretty good, not sure if they are the freezer variety or if they make there own. The skin is on the thicker side, but this is expected in the midwestIn summary, I have tried tried asian food in China, Hong Kong, Thailand and this is by no means anywhere close. The food is good given the variety and the location in Central Illinois. The extensive menu is really different proteins with variety of ingredients. Often the meat is cooked in a wok with high heat and then a sauce is applied. Given the volume a lot of the meats were a bit overcooked and dry. If you have a large party it is great given no need for TIP, BYOB; but if you want real authentic asian food you will have to go to Chinatown!Pros: super large menu, relatively good prices, BYOB, no gratuity (1 dollar service fee for table cleaning), free tea, large tables for groupsCons: very busy, small parking lot, no real \"service\", food is a bit dry and overcookedHidden deals: Pay in cash for 5% off, I am sure this is for there own tax write off purpose......Health code rating: B, some issues based on the report for food temperature. http://champaign.il.gegov.com/champaign/estab.cfm?facilityID=1523",

I was determined to try a non-Americanized chinese dish, so I went through all of the pictures and descriptions on Yelp. I asked the person taking orders to explain the difference between a couple of dishes and make a recommendation. She was very patient and thorough, and her explanations were easy to understand and decipher.  Due to raving reviews I read about crispy tofu, that was what I went with. I got the dish to go- It was a Tuesday night and I waited about 15 minutes for the food to come out. I don't mind waiting- must really be cooked to order! My only regret is that I didn't get it to go. The tofu had been sitting in a puddle of sauce in a container (as opposed to a shallow pool of sauce on a plate) that it lost is crispyness. The sauce, which is rather sweet, was a little too sweet for me to enjoy it as a main dish. I would have loved to have gotten a smaller portion of it as an appetizer.All in all, I'm excited to go back to Champaign and try another dish next time.By the way, portions are HUGE. I mean, seriously huge. 1 order can easily feed two!",

The menu is in Chinese and is very intimidating to a non-speaker, so I'd suggest coming with someone who can read it! English menu seems limited next to it. Today, we had beef soup noodles, beef chao fan, crispy tofu, white boiled fish (english translation), and soy sauce eggs with ground meat. This was plenty of food for our party of 4. The beef chao fan and soup noodles were just okay. Chao fan was over sauced and on the salty side. The soup noodles were too soft and the broth was bland. Soy sauce eggs were alright as well- surrounding meat and sauce was very salty, and eggs themselves needed more flavor. The crispy tofu was delicious as always- love this dish, and order it every time. I highly recommend it! The white boiled fish sounds better in chinese, but the dish itself was excellent. Soft pillows of fish- very light. Overall, our meal was decent here. Because of our small group we didn't have some of our favorites like the braised pork belly buns. We will be back for more cheap yet good chinese good in the future!",

I think they must have heard because when we went it was really clear how to do it and I found it very easy. They have a big sign with instructions and instructions inside the menus, also. To be clear, you go in the door, there are menus, the American and the translated. You take an order pad and a pen, write down the number of what you want, take it to the counter and pay. They give you a number then bring the food to your table. After you pay, there is a table with flatware for you to grab. They bring your plates, napkins, and chopsticks to the table for you. Simple and easy!The translated menu has SO many choices! I didn't know what to order so I went with the standard General's chicken and my hubby got the Schezwan chicken. We split the pork filled pot stickers. Everything was amazing, just amazing. Best Chinese food I have ever had.I think next time we go, I'd like to have my Chinese friend order for us. I think that'd be a lot more fun and I'd get to try more authentic foods since everyone has been raving about them. I think he'd choose a lot of different and tasty stuff besides the Americanized dishes. We got there a bit after 5. Around 5:30 it was like the flood gates opened at it was PACKED (it was a Saturday). There are a lot of tables. It's good for groups too because they have a lot of big round tables with the lazy Susan in the middle for sharing and passing different dishes. I can't wait to go again, at least I have plenty of leftovers to last a while! The portions are generous! Top notch!",

Word around town has been that there are some very authentic menu items and that venturing into this restaurant is daunting and definitely not in the average persons comfort zone. I decided I would try it when a group opportunity to go presented itself.  What a fool I am for waiting. When you go inside, yes, it is very authentic to the standard restaurant you'd see overseas. There is a menu in Chinese on the wall, but they offer an American menu as well, including one with more \"traditional\" Americanized Chinese food.  On the menu there are thousands of offerings!  Yes, some items may put most people off, such as tripe, pig intestines, duck tongue, and some others, but look past that to the other thousand or so offerings!  Best Chinese food I've had in over 15 years since I was in an area with real authentic Chinese food.We had the eggplant and pork, salt and pepper pork,  crispy pan fried noodle with seafood, pork and Napa dumplings, garlic string beans and the chicken with bean sauce. Everything was amazing.  Delicious! We all left stuffed with a bag of leftovers and I am anxiously waiting to get to eat them tonight. Sophie at the register is a delight. This place is no tip.

It's not all over cooked and doused in soy sauce like many asian food places have. The rice is still moist and soft, and the eggs are cooked fresh. Also, the meat still has some juicyness to it. AWESOME.Rangoons: These only have cheese in them. I wish they had crab. Typical rangoons, really.American Chicken Lo-Mein: Typical Lo-Mein, but really good!I can't wait to come back again and try new things!",

As a result of that, I chose one of the popular food in Taiwan--the oil rice and another food I thought it might not taste bad--stew beef belly. The oil rice they provided is not the oil rice at all!! It tasted weird and rice did stick together. This had to be one of the weirdest oil rice I'd ever had. For the beef one, I'd say it tasted ok but totally tough. Overall, it's an expensive restaurant and if you want to find a Taiwanese style restaurant, you will feel disappointed.",

But I had no idea that I would be standing in front of the wall for so long - the menu is super extensive. The funny thing is when I mentioned that they have an \"egg\" section and a claypot section - my friends didn't even know! They have an interesting operation where customers order by the number on a slip of paper and then you pay for it at the counter. They charge 50 cents for clearing the table. And you grab all the utensils, bowls, tea, cups by yourself. We ordered the fried tofu, because that's one of the few dishes that my friends always get. However, I thought it was just okay. I prefer crispy fried tofu, not mushy fried tofu. We tried the salted fish with chicken claypot rice and that was pretty legit. The pork bun from the Taiwanese section was good too. They serve the buns and the meat separately so you make your own sandwich. The pork chop udon was a little disappointing, the pork chop looked super dry. They also have a dim sum section and we got the liquid-y yellow bun aka \"lau sa bao\" in Cantonese. That's a popular dim sum in Hong Kong and it's special because the steamed bun has liquidy yellow egg custard oozing out when you bite into it. However, the egg custard at this place wasn't too liquid-y so it was more like \"lai wong bao\". We got some simple green veggies to balance everything else out. My friends warned me to drink lots of water due to the amount of MSG in the food and boy, were they not kidding. It's still good though. It sure beats ordering from the English menu :)",

The prices aren't cheap, but it's completely worth it.Drink lots of tea so that you can eat more and don't be hesitant to try food off the authentic Chinese menu. We tried the stinky tofu just because there was a disclaimer about how badly it smelled and how no refunds were allowed. It wasn't quite worth it, but it was fun.The duck tongue and frog legs were great and the pork belly pancakes- if you want to try weird foods.",

I think it's very misleading to have a restaurant bill itself as \"authentic Chinese cuisine\" then specialize in their Taiwanese dishes only. I had hoped their Chinese dishes would be good or passable at least, but their versions of Mongolian beef, Szechuan chicken, and chicken with black bean sauce were barely edible. I would give the Chinese food 2 stars and the Taiwanese food 4 stars (because the Crispy fried tofu was good) and average it all at 3 stars.Taiwanese dishes are heavy on soy sauce and sesame oil.  They can have a Malaysian influence. There are a lot of deep fried dishes. So if you prefer deep-fried food and brown sauces, as well as home-style or stewed meat, you might like this restaurant quite a bit. It's BYOB and bus your own table or pay a $1 fee, so good for feeding a large group family-style, by sharing dishes.Take a close look at the pictures that customers have attached of the food they ate here because that's what it really looks like. what wiki has to say about Taiwanese food:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwanese_cuisine",

The seating can be awkward since there have been times when I've gone with a very small group, or one other person, and had to sit at one of the large family style tables.  The menu is very, very, very comprehensive but sometimes difficult to navigate.  And the pricing is very expensive for what it is.",

(Previous post was to confirm the restaurant is indeed Tina's which was in question before she actually opened.)Tina's new place is at the site of the old Pickles restaurant on Green St.  She thankfully gutted most of the restaurant (needed it ages ago) and it is now very open.  There are numerous tables for Chinese Family-Style eating (lazy-susan in the middle of the table for food) along with standard tables (4-seaters).  So, this is a larger restaurant by Tina's standards (larger than Mandarin Wok's total seating).  She has Tea-Pots for tables now and a large tea making machine.  A great addition to the restaurant.  There's now enough space for the chinese menu out front and also the buffet table (only used during moon festival I think).Unfortunately I removed one star from the 5 for two things which together I felt were slightly important to new visitors...(- half-star) The new system of computer ordering from front to back of house is a bit frustrating for old customers of the Woks.  You are presented with a pad of paper and a pen and instructed to place your table number and number of party on the pad.  You then write down the numbers of items you wish to order.  When you get to the front all of this goes into the computer and zipped back to the cooks by electrical magic.  This is significantly faster than the older method of ordering, but much less personable.  One of the golden linings of Tina's restaurants is actually Tina herself- she knows her menu and she wields it well.  So, if you aren't sure what to order, you're in a bit of a bind with the new system.  Now, this was the first week, so it all might calm down in a week or two.  Incidentally some of the items on the menu are actually mistranslated.The items we had (and love) are:#204 - Spicy Basil Chicken  (mislabeled on the menu)#851 - Garlic Stir Fried Green BeansThe final half-star off is for a slight difference in flavor in the #204- I don't know what it is, hard to put my finger on it- I think it's due to new equipment, but it's ever so slightly different (at least when I had it).I'm definitely tempted to to give Tina 5 stars, as I can't express how happy I am I can eat her food again, but I feel for those who are going to go to her new place for the first time, those two aspects may make a difference.I hope to be back with more numbers to add to the list of dishes we really love.  I'll reconsider the last star as we go more often.  I suspect the first week will always be a bit rough around the edges.Definitely a place to recommend to everyone interested in Taiwanese food.[Addendum- we came for dinner the night before, but had to leave as there were no tables to be had and a 1 hour wait for food.  We came back the next day for lunch, and it was much better.]",

You choose from either the abbreviated American menu, or go through the full \"Translated Menu\" and write your own guest check and give it to the cashier, pay, then take a number to your table to receive your food.  I actually love this idea as I, a waiter, have always felt conflicted as how to tip in most Chinese restaurants where you terrible service, but a server does come to your table and bring you your stuff so you feel compelled to leave something. . . . Golden Harbor even has signs saying tips aren't required and instead charge a $.50 per person clean up fee.  I also like how they give a five percent discount if you pay cash and the cashier was completely fluent in English and was far friendlier than any other Cashier/waitress I've experienced at a Chinese restaurant in town.The food was on par with what I've had at Lao Sze Schuan in Chicago's Chinatown, and far superior to any Chinese place I've found in town where every dish was basically - meat, veg, rice, generic greasy sauce,/no flavor.\" This is definitely a place for someone who appreciates good Chinese food, but isn't necessarily concerned with the ambiance or service.",

The menu is extensive and often times overwhelming, but try to narrow it down to a few good dishes. Like most people, I recommend the Crispy Tofu, Peking Duck, and Three Cup Chicken.Don't go looking for typical Americanized Chinese dishes, you'll regret it because you have an opportunity to try real, delicious Chinese cuisine. Also, if you share a bunch of dishes amongst a group, your total won't come out to be unreasonable! It gets pretty busy on the weekends, but generally tables clear out pretty fast so don't be discouraged.Yum!",

Until I came across Golden Harbor, my Chinese food options were just limited to carry out places where I used to more often than not get the Vegetarian Fried Rice and the Vegetarian Spring Rolls but Golden Harbor to me redefined the concept of Chinese Food.  They have an elaborate menu for Vegetarians (which is very unlikely for a Chinese Restaurant) and note that none of these Vegetarian dishes contain duck sauce or oyster sauce like most of the other Chinese places.  The owner is an extremely friendly person who greets you with a smile and explains to you the menu in detail if you have any questions.  When it comes to orders, this restaurant works differently.  You have plenty of tables to sit and dine but the waiters don't come to take your order.  As soon as you enter you have a table filled with menus (both the American version and the Chinese version), a small book and some pens for you to write the order and mark it and give it to the owner at the billing counter.  The lady then gives you a token for you to take and place it on the table you sit.  Then the waiters come and deliver the food to your table.My personal favorites at this restaurant are Vegetable steamed dumplings and Spicy Hunan Vegetables.",

It's a self service restaurant - u write down ur order on the order pad and give to the cashier. Pay with cash as they charge u cc transaction fee if u use one. Also they charge u for table cleaning fee ($.50 per person ).  Water and jasmine tea are free.Endless options of food - from general tso chicken to sea cucumber. Crispy tofu seemed popular so I tried and it was very good - love the sauce!! We also had duck with bun , pork with black pepper (lots of black pepper), general tso chicken, seafood hot pot( this is different than what people would  normally call a hot pot), prawn with sweet chili sauce, wonton soup, egg drop soup, fried dumpling, and cheese ragoon ( no crab in it). In general, everything was good and tasty!!If you can go earlier, that's better so that way you don't have to complete for a table and wait in line to order  :) Again, their menu is huge so this is place you have go over and over to try different  food!",

If you want to be pampered, go somewhere else.  If you want tasty & authentic chinese, eat here!  Other reviewers have complained about the notepad ordering system, and it's really not my favorite system, either.  On the other hand, folks who knew them from The Wok in Mahomet who don't read chinese will appreciate the fact that the full menu is now available in English.  One of those reviewers was perplexed about how to order a dish not-so-spicey, but it worked great for us simply to write EXTRA SPICEY next to one dish and NOT SPICEY next to another.  I feel more confident writing NOT SPICEY on the pad of paper than I do saying it.  I've had dinner there two nights in a row and still find myself craving it for dinner tonight.  My partner went for lunch yesterday and met me there again for dinner; we may have to consider just moving in!  I had the crispy tofu, which has been an absolutely favorite from the Wok in Mahomet, and my new favorite is the Snow Pea Leaves with Garlic.  I was blown away by how tasty and fresh this dish tastes.  My partner had the Cilantro Pork on Noodle and loved it.  The dumplings were awesome, and I like the vegetable egg rolls better than the regular egg rolls.  The counter staff are extremely friendly and helpful.  When I placed an order for a dish from the Diced Chicken W/ Bone, she made sure I knew that the dish I was ordering was chicken ON the bone.  She also remembered us from the Mahomet restaurant and remembered to leave the onions out of my partner's dish.I was also surprised by the dollar charge to clear your table; at the Mahomet restaurant, I always cleared my plates away and they wiped down the tables. Frankly, the prices are so good I don't mind paying an extra buck.  So this restaurant is ideal for me:  great food, no frills on the setting or service, and lower prices.  If they had full waiter service, there would be longer waits for tables, and the prices would have to be much higher.  I'd rather save the money and eat there more often!",

I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could.I've ordered the noodles mostly but have tried other items like the chicken fried rice (that was okay, pretty plain), pan fried noodles with pork (too much ginger for my taste), and some Singapore noodles which were really great!I want to try the other items but it can be a bit overwhelming when ordering. There are SO many options. It also is a lot pricier than it should be but what can you expect. Also, if you pay in cash you pay 5% less or something.",

If ambiance isn 't a must for you, then definitely try the place for the food.  You write down your order at your table and take it to the counter to order and pay.  They bring plates, napkins and chopsticks to your table along with your food.They have two menus.  One is simplified--more like you see in a regular Asian restaurant, and another that is authentic and huge, with many unusual items.The portions are very generous, and ours was delicious.  I had the chicken vegetables with chili sauce.  It was pleasantly spicy and very tasty.  My son had the fried tofu in chili sauce and my husband had cashew chicken.  They cleaned their plates.   The only dish I wasn't crazy about were the steamed dumplings.  Just so-so.Regarding other comments about it being pricey, you have to consider this is a \"no tip\" place.  The price of each dish is approx equivalent to what you would pay elsewhere with a tip.We don't live in Champaign, but we 'll stop in again as we pass through town.",

Otherwise, you might over-order just like my family and I did today (our party were 4 adults and a child). Despite this, we were very happy with all of our choices (plus we got to take home an entire meal worth of left-overs--yay, tomorrow's lunch!). It was a wonderful way to celebrate our daughter's twenty first birthday.We ordered: #87A (fried tofu with onions, garlic, and shallots over noodles); #32A (beef brisket-tendon soup with noodles and bok choy); #128 (fried rice with Cantonese  sausage--aka lap cheong sausage); #523 (brisket with hozu sauce); #443 (braised duck tongue in spicy sauce); #592 (squid curry hot pot); #1503 (8-piece fried pork dumplings/pot stickers); and #B33 (10-piece steamed mini chicken buns). Let me just sum it up: everything was perfectly seasoned, cooked, and served at the right temperature and even though it was crowded when we got there, once we got a table and ordered, we did not wait long and we were definitely not disappointed! I could taste freshness in every bite--nothing was sitting in a steam tray under hot lights--it was all made to order.More first-timer tips before heading over: 1) I got the impression that it's first come, first served. If it's crowded and there are no tables, be persistent because the food is well worth it. Plus the tables turn over pretty quickly (we came between two successive waves of late afternoon and evening diners but we did not wait as long as we would have for a table at some of the popular places along North Prospect). 2) On the website, a contributor suggests that you bypass the menus, both printed or on the wall and just ask the friendly young lady at the counter who takes your order (she is pretty good at suggesting options according to what you're in the mood for). I might try this option next time. 3) The water and hot tea are very good and very free--yes, it was tap water from the fountain dispenser but I'd swear they use a filtration system because the water did not taste metallic or chemical like you might experience with a fast-food fountain. (I think this is one of the seemingly basic details that makes all the difference between having an ok experience and a really good experience). 4) You will not have to tip--they charge a one-dollar per diner surcharge for cleaning/bussing, but you are essentially placing your own order by writing down the number of the menu item and indicating how many diners are at your table. It's not your typical restaurant but it really works! 5) No alcohol is sold there but you can BYOB!Five stars is not enough stars for Golden Harbor.",

Grab a seat, serve yourself and your friends some hot tea or water, and get ready for heaven.Best dishes? We always order crispy tofu (a couple plates of it actually), salt and pepper chicken, pepper beef, dou miao or kong xin cai, the honey walnut shrimp, and whatever else looks good in the pictures. If you ever need help finding something new and delicious, Sophie knows what to get, and you can follow the facebook page for Golden Harbor that she manages (rather, curates) for news on what's cooking, what's hot, what's in season, and what's good. As a bonus, every so often you get a handful of cute posts, pictures, and videos to brighten up your days of the week, and that's always a good thing.What more is there to say? This is the place to satisfy your tastes. I graduated this year and live in San Francisco now, but I still miss eating here. Do yourself a favor and choose Golden Harbor!",

It's a very unique atmosphere compared to almost every other \"Americanized\" restaurant. The only real way to describe it is a family style seating at the large round tables where everyone shares. However, they also have smaller tables for small parties. I ordered Hot-and-Sour soup, Crab Rangoon, egg rolls, and Mongolian beef. My girlfriend orders some type of chicken dish, which I tired and was delicious. One dish is definitely big enough to split between two people as the portions are rather generous. I will continue going here when I'm visiting Campaign-Urbana.",

The menu is huge and posted on the wall (and there are menus). I'm so overwhelmed on what to order as everything seems delicious! The prices may seem a bit high at first, HOWEVER, they don't accept tip and it is sort of self-served (they will bring out the food to you though). I love how they have real authentic Chinese food with varying regional styles. This particular visit, we ordered their specialty tofu dish with soy sauce and scallions, a pork soup, drunken shrimp, and fried rice. LOVED the flavors although they were a bit salty for my taste, but some rice takes care of that. The tofu was crisped perfectly and the soy sauce is thick and filled with aromatic flavors from the garlic and scallions. The pork soup was nice, it is Taiwanese style and authentic. Haven't been able to find that soup elsewhere in the states yet. The drunken shrimp was spot on with the cooking wine and herbs. The shrimp meat was fresh as well! However, I recommend to skip the fried rice here, nothing really special whatsoever.Probably will drop by this place every time I visit the area. Give it a try!",

If you end up chosing sweet and sour chicken you deserve a slow fiery death.3- Write your entree number and the quantity (figure on getting one entree per person and having leftovers, unless you are super-hungry. You will get rice with the entree) and return the order to the lady at the cash register, who will take your money.4- That lady will give you glasses for water and direct you to where the tea is.5- Wait 10 min or so. Don't fret, they will bring your chopsticks and napkins.6- Enjoy the shit out of your yummy vittles. Don't forget to share, as no matter how freaking good your selection is, whatever your fellow diner got is just as good.I've had the Salt and Pepper Shitake Mushrooms (they are not on the menu, but the lady at the counter knows what you are talking about) and the Crispy Tofu as featured at http://champaign-taste.blogspot.com/2010/11/golden-harbor-authentic-chinese-cuisine.html These two are freaking divine.

My friends and I always joke that they would make bank if they moved up to the Chicago suburb area. But they do very well already right now where they are. My family has known their family for about 6 years now, and they are the sweetest people on earth. If you're not sure what to order, you can always ask them (Tina is very helpful) what they recommend. Our staple dishes here are:Steamed fish (i don't know the name, but it's some type of white fish steamed with green onions, ginger, sitting on top of bean sprouts. So fresh and delicious!)Crab Rangoon - never had betterOrange ChickenBasil Eggplantsoup of some kind, they're all pretty goodsmoked chicken Crispy Tofu!!! People try to copy their recipe, but the original is still, after all these years, unbeatable!Service in my opinion is always great. If you're going to gripe about cleaning your own table or writing down your order on a piece of paper (it just makes the ordering and cooking process faster - win for everyone), then don't eat here. More good food for the rest of us who don't need to be sucked up to and waited on for a good meal. This is your cozy mom and pop and daughter Chinese food shop. There's so much love in that food! :)",

Very nice. Patient with me as I tried to navigate their 1-million-item menu. I asked her for a couple of recommendations; I like sweet and sour, chicken, maybe a veggie or two and not too spicy; she obliged with several tasty suggestions. I got the sweet and sour noodles, orange chicken, shanghai egg rolls and some awesome garlicky bok choi number; everything was on target.

I had heard about the complicated ordering system and the offering of strange meat items (goat? some kind of squid?).Well, I finally went last Tuesday... and WOW. Here's a breakdown of the trip:My friend made reservations for our group of six. Our table was ready right on time, and while it wasn't super crowded, it seems that making a reservation for a group of more than four is a good idea. We picked up our menus and a pad of receipt paper, and a friend grabbed tea and cups for all. The tea was fantastic. The menu, bewildering - in the best way something can be bewildering.There are SO MANY OPTIONS, and so many of them sound AWESOME. We ended up with six dishes, to be shared family style. I chose a crispy eggplant and basil dish, and Mr. Husband got some crispy pork. We also had another eggplant dish (I want to cry just thinking about it! SO much scrumptious eggplant!), a black vinegar pork, some kind of weird crab thing (I don't like eating things that look like spiders, so I didn't eat that), and, uh, something else fried. Our food was served surprisingly quickly, considering we ordered six things. It only took 10-15 minutes as I recall. (The conversation was amusing, though, so it may have taken slightly longer.)The eggplant dishes were like riding a dragon while eating cotton candy made from angel tears (awesome). I loved loved loved the crispy fried eggplant! I surprised myself, too, in that my second-favorite dish was black vinegar pork. Mmm. I tried everything except the spiders, and I was in heaven. Prices were decent. Expect to pay around $10-15 per person. Considering that they charge a table-clearing fee and there's no expectation to leave a tip, that's pretty decent. Consider going elsewhere - you might only spend $6-8 per person on an entree, but then you add a drink, and have to tip 20% at the end. The total trip cost me $25 for 2 dishes, which I was pleased with.Bottom line, for the \"tl;dr\" crowd: Awesome food, not too expensive, go with a group, make a reservation, drink tea, don't eat spider-crabs.",

When This place first opened I was intrigued to try it.  I had not been to their place in Mahomet but my mother always raved about their food.When you first walk into GH you find a table with pens order tablets and menus, both an American menu and more authentic menu with a billion items on it! (Well.. not a billion but I still take 20 minutes to decide what I want to this day...and I've been to GH my fair share of times, and then some)  For some reason there are a lot of people that don't care for this way of running things and I have watched people literally walk in.. look around, you see it click in their head how things work as they read the signs, and walk out. WTH?!  It's not rocket science and its really a relief to have a place to go that isn't a cookie cutter restaurant like a lot of the chain garbage around here.  The lady behind the counter is super friendly and will help you through the process if you're confused.  She also will recommend something for you to try if you tell her what you're in the mood for.  If you want something done a little differently, no problem.  VERY accommodating!Anyway, you figure out what you want and write it on the pad and pay.  They give you a number and you find a table.  Hot tea and water are available to go grab while you wait (or soda for purchase)  AND this place is also a BYOB! awesome.  Depending on how busy they are they can take 10 minutes and some nights where its busy I've waited ~30 to get all our food.. which in comparison to other businesses on a busy night, is nothing.  Also sometimes the food comes out in strange orders (main dish before soup or apps)  but that also is no big deal, I would rather my food be fresh and hot (which it always is here) then have it come out cold due to course etiquette.Now for the food.  Everyone says the crispy tofu is amazing, which it is.  But since that is a given I won't go into that.  My husband and I have tried to switch things up every time we go, but over time we've found some go-to dishes.  I really enjoy all the \"crispy\" dishes, the basil chicken is almost a candied texture and soooo yum! And they are super generous on the basil! Enough for every bite! There's also one in sweet chili sauce that I remember enjoying.  Also a sweet chili crispy pork (I'm drooling now).  The crispy beef with black bean is nothing like one of those cheap chain beef and black beans.  Its huge chunks of meat that are cooked until just perfectly done and have the best meaty taste unlike allot of places where you question what the meat is you are actually eating and what they've done to it to make it the disgusting flavorless texture it is.  This stuff is a great combination of flavor and they don't use the sauce to mask the meat.  We also enjoy the \"salt and pepper\" items, The salt and pepper squid is great, simple and done perfectly(there is no sauce) though I would ask them to go light on the salt as it is sometimes a little overpowering (but I love salt) The one thing my husband always goes back to is the crispy shredded pork in hot oil sauce, and I've got to say, it's pretty darn amazing as well. (am I getting repetitive yet with the \"amazing/awesome\" comments, at least you're getting my point this place is friggen great!)  So this pork is little crispy golden tidbits with lots of cilantro and hot peppers and its coated in this indescribable sauce, I'm sure it's simple.. but simple is good!  And this is one thing you have to try!  Never disappoints!  My 3 year old daughter likes the egg drop soup and the vegetarian egg rolls, which I've tried nibbles of and also find enjoyable.  The soup is thick and filling and not neon orangey yellow, you know its homemade.  The veggie rolls are crisp and light.  Even the rice is delightful!  You can have fried or white (we tend to ask for both)  And if you need more, just bring up your bowl and they will give you more!I could go on forever about this place, you can't go wrong, be adventurous!  Close your eyes and run your finger down the menu, where ever you stop, you'll love it!",

There's a table set aside covered in menus and \"Guest Check\" books for you to fill out your own order form.  Then you queue up and wait to pay.  If you have questions you are asked not to delay the people behind you, to step out of the line.  Except that the line is never ending so you cannot get your question answered without stalling the line.Next, only credit cards and checks pay the full bill.  Cash payers get a 5% discount. No tipping is allowed or expected.And a new rule as of November 27, 2011, they add 50 cents person as a charge for cleaning the table, because the former practice of allowing people to clean up after themselves on busy nights (and avoid the fee) caused spilled sauces and sloppy floors.Strange, but explainable.  Lastly, a soft drink with unlimited refills costs $2.60, which might be the highest priced soda pop in Champaign County.",

The BBQ pork bun was a lot doughier than I'm used to- and yes I understand they are steamed bread, and always somewhat doughy. I loved the curry, which was not thick and sweet, but just curry-hot.  Vegetables and meats were all cooked perfectly, and the woman who took my order was very helpful in determining whether we wanted \"authentic\" or \"American\" versions of soups and eggrolls. A to-go station had all the chopsticks, utencils, napkins, and sauces.  If I lived in Champaign I don't doubt this would be my go-to Chinese restaurant.",

Ever.I'm a big fan of chinese food and when I have my cravings, I usually have to settle for places that have limited vegetarian options and greasy stir fry that tastes suspiciously like it has duck sauce or oyster sauce. Not Golden Harbor though. The vegetarian menu option runs in pages. Literally. Well, first off, there are two menus to choose from- one is the American menu and the other is the Chinese menu. Both have lots of options in tofu, eggplant and vegetables. There is a super friendly and a sweet lady (who is also the owner) up in the front who processess your orders and you can ask her any question about the dish, she will take her time to explain it to you and what it has. She also makes sure that the kitchen caters to your vegan/vegetarian needs. Once the kitchen messed up our order and we got all meat stuff. When we went back to tell her that it was not what we ordered, she was so apologetic, threw in an order of steamed vegetable dumplings for free and personally made sure that we got our right order this time. Making good food is one thing but being so customer friendly and personal for a popular restaurant is another. Having been to many popular restaurants, with bad service and arrogant owners, I will easily give this place 5 starts and more. My personal recommendation- steamed vegetable dumplings. There are 8 pieces in total and make excellent starter. The outer coat is thin and less chewy (unlike other places where the outer shell is so chewy and thick)If you are a vegetarian and in the C-U area, I would highly recommend this place.",

My one Chinese friend informed me that this was NOT the best he has ever had but I don't believe him. // Szechwan beef - This might be my favorite dish. The meat is so tender, you would never believe it came from a Chinese restaurant. Ha!// Sesame ball - these are stuffed with red bean paste. I can't tell if they are a dessert or an appetizer. Either way it is delicious// Hot and Sour soup & Egg drop Soup - the MSG is to die for... haha I think i like the Egg drop soup a little more. The consistency is soo perfect.

Very easy and low stress way to dine, though perhaps it may confuse some.Tea and water are provided for free.   This restaurant is BYOB, and there's a nice liquor store next door.PROS:   Amazingly authentic menu!   I've lived in China and traveled there extensively, and found many of my old favorites on the menu.   (A Chinese menu is posted on the wall with item numbers that correspond to the English language menus.)    I got to enjoy food I've haven't had in years and never thought I'd find in the US -- great stuff from several regions of China.    I also enjoyed some items that I hadn't had before, or had enjoyed in slightly different forms.   The crispy tofu for which this restaurant is so well-known is a fun item that everyone should try.   The pork bun is amazing!  Well-seasoned fatty deliciousness.    So many items to try.   I wish I lived in the area.CONS:   None at all.   I hope this place never changes.",

If you avoid peak times (dinner Fri & Sat), there is rarely a long line to order & food comes out fast (& piping hot!). If there is a wait, it's still well worth it!Our favorite dishes are salt and pepper chicken, spicy green beans with pork, crispy beef with garlic, pork belly buns, crispy tofu and sesame balls for dessert - just to name a few. Hot jasmine tea is complimentary and it is BYOB so we typically bring a bottle of plum wine along, too. (Am-Ko carries a nice selection of plum wine and is right around the corner.)

I also tried the Crispy Cuttlefish with salt yolk which I was very surprised by how good it was, I though it would be too salty but it was quite tasty.

My boyfriend and I were moving in from out of town and his parents were here to help. We wanted a quick and easy takeout meal to thank our helpers. They suggested Chinese. I was a bit skeptical about finding good Chinese food in central Illinois. My skepticism is long gone! We ordered tofu and mushrooms, Kung Pao vegetables, bok choy in garlic sauce, vegetable and tofu lo mein, hot and sour soup (amazing!), and egg rolls. I'm not normally a fan of egg rolls, but I thought they were ok. They lacked filling for my taste, the inlaws agreed. My favorite part of the meal was the hot and sour soup. It is my favorite, when done right and not many places do it well. I am glad to say that they do an amazing job with it here. Best of all they are very reasonably priced! This is definitely my go to place in town for Chinese food. I don't even want to try anywhere else because we had such a great experience here. Even the boyfriend that isn't crazy about Chinese food wants to go again!",

This dish alone reminds me of mom, dad and us 9 kids eating dinner at the table.Has just enough salt to add flavor, spiciness to give it that lovely kick and a hint of lemongrass to remind me of home.The pork belly was good but not great, I would order it again.  The star of anise was a bit overpowering.The time it takes to prepare these wonderful dishes are amazing, considering the size of this place and the volume they are very quick.Highly recommend it!",

My parents visited me, and we have visited our fair share of local restaurants. This is probably one of the best things I have ever had. The Crispy Basil Chicken is the best variation of fried chicken I've had here in my time in the land of fried foods. I also had mixed vegetables with seaweed and shrimp-filled wonton soup, which were also glorious.I love my tea, and the fact that it is free and self-serve for pots of jasmine tea make my inner Uncle Iroh happy.",

They make both a family and lunch special portion that are priced accordingly.Food is delivered to your table but you must bus your own dishes unless you want to pay extra.

My questions were answered and my order taken correctly, how easy!2 of us tried our hands at the Chinese menu, whereas one of us opted for the more simplistic Orange Chicken, which he said might have been some of the best he ever had. I got something called Chengdu chicken and my other roommate got a seafood combo with rice noodles. Unfortunately I was the only one who didn't really care for my dish. Don't get me wrong, it was different and the meat was of noticeable higher quality than the usual Chinese places around here, but the flavor just didn't grab me that much. I also didn't really care for the green veggies inside (raw zucchini or celery, maybe..?).The cost was significantly higher than typical Chinese, my dish was ~$14, granted the portion was enough for 2 large meals.I will have to try something else. I feel like Chinese food is always a gamble, usually I win, but this time I got unlucky and lost.",

Everything was written in Chinese, except, of course, for the giant sign on the wall, with moderately clear instructions (it's above the table on right, just as you walk in.) So, we took a menu, an ordering pad, and a pen, and sat down. You write the number of the order, not the name, on the pad. They didn't indicate whether you should write the type of rice you wanted, but we did so anyways. You then take the pad to the cashier (they're was a decent line) and pay for your order.Over the next 20 minutes, the wait staff bring your dishes to you. The first dish arrived easily 5 minutes before the rest, so I ate a lot of that... But it was sooooo darn delicious, and the helpings were generous. We spent about $70 for 5 heaping plates, a pot of tea, and two sides of rice. However, I did ask the busboy if he could bring me to-go boxes, and he never did. Granted, we're not supposed to tip, so there's that.Overall, it's well worth the confusion and questionable service. I'm pretty sure their system is there to optimize price and quality. The only thing I dislike is the shoddy directions. I feel like a big \"seat yourself sign\" with menus and an ordering pad at the table would eliminate the constant stream of bumbling newcomers. Or simply placing the sign immediately in the view of the entrance, instead of high on the wall to the right. Otherwise, it was a delicious adventure!",

You got it!  Okay, wait... that last one I might be making up, but the first, dude... I get it every time!Alls I'm saying is-- these people will do everything to make your order, NAY, your EXPERIENCE something awesome.  And that's a restaurant I can get behind!The food is excellent.  Rice is the perfect consistency (not too dry, but not wet, either).  Their sauces are incredible (try the Princess for a spicy kick, or the Empress for something a little spicy-sweet).  Their veg is even good in my book, diced or sliced thin, not overbearing!  Everything is just hot, and yummy, and delicious and my favorite, not too hard on the wallet.Golden Harbor is located in the old Pickles location (trust me, a Champaign paragon in its day), so it's pretty much central to Champaign, Urbana, AND Savoy. Tell them where you're coming from when you order and they'll make sure the food is separated out in containers that keep things from getting soggy on the way. Whether you choose to eat in (now that they have the ventilation under control) or decide to carry-out, Golden Harbor Authentic is one of the best Chinese places you can choose in C-U.",

                "review": "There was some time, in what seems like ages ago, that I lived immediately outside Chinatown in Chicago. While Chicago is certainly not known for having the best gathering of Chinese food in the country, we certainly made do with some wonderful meals. The short of it: going to Golden Harbor makes me feel like I'm back in the city. I absolutely loved the food. I loved it so much that I'm currently laying on the couch because I can't move. It's good stuff, Maynard. I scoured the reviews and we ordered most of what others liked: crispy tofu (good, but I probably wouldn't order it again); crispy chicken basil (amazing with just the right amount of kick!); salt and pepper prawns (OMG salt and pepper anything, really, but these were great and had some kick, too); 1/2 Peking duck (okay, they give you tortillas instead of pancakes which kind of sucked but the hoisin and scallions were great and the duck - OMG - the duck! so moist and perfectly fried); Chinese pork fried rice (decent, I suppose, but didn't have a ton of flavor without soy sauce -- but, to be fair, I'm not a huge fried rice lover); steamed BBQ buns (always good, of course); and my brother got the general tso's chicken (not normally a fan of this dish because I think it's too sweet, but this version was less sweet and I really liked it).  Sophie at the front was maybe the most adorable girl ever and so helpful. :] She even threw in a thing of sesame balls that were incredible. So unique tasting and their sweetness was surprising. The menu is overwhelming and the seating is chaotic. I'm glad we took our food home with us to enjoy. I get panicky in places such as this sometimes, and I certainly couldn't have picked what to eat without the help of the yelp reviews; the menu is like 20 pages long and an anxiety sufferer's worst nightmare. This is what keeps me from giving it a full five stars. Next time I'm in chambana visiting my brother, I will certainly go back. Bravo, GH. Thank you for restoring my faith in Chinese cuisine.",

It is really delicious, and the chicken pieces were very large.-The white rice was steamed very well.-The fried rice was lighter than typical fried rice, and my S.O. said it was very good.-The customer service was really nice! You write down your own order and take it up to the cashier (who's really nice!), and they take care of everything from there. Water and hot tea are complimentary. The Meh:-The crab rangoon were okay, not great, but okay.-The vegetable dumplings just okay. The dumpling skins themselves seemed very, very thin, causing them to tear when we tried to pick them up. -The shrimp dumplings had mixed reviews (between my S.O. and me). I thought they were okay, but my S.O. was not a fan.The Bad:-NothingOverall:-I really liked coming here, the entrees were very good. I also really liked the atmosphere, it felt like a family run restaurant, which I always appreciate. We will definitely be back!",

I walked in the door for dinner on a wintry evening and due to a serious ventilation problem found myself enveloped by invisible choking fumes. The fumes were from cooking peppers, I'm guessing? They didn't smell so much as they burned and choked. Some sort of fan in the kitchen must have been broken -- seriously, it was comical. I am not reporting an individual sensitivity of mine.  A very large party arrived just after we did and so I got to watch about fifteen people walk in the front door and then sequentially have the same reaction: walk in from the cold, take a deep breath, and start coughing.We all went along, I'm not sure why.  The restaurant was about one third full and all of the patrons sat there, tears in our eyes, each eating a few bites and then experiencing a racking cough.  We went through the bizarre ordering process and obeyed the greasy cardboard hand-lettered signs. So many of the other reviews rave about the food but mine was extremely oversalted.  Oversalted, after all this?Even if it had been Michelin three star food, you've got to have air.  My advice: Focus on the basics.",

Another blogger has been posting pictures and descriptions at http://goldenharborchineserestaurant.blogspot.com/. I was inspired by one the pictures to order #896 (Snow pea leaves with King Mushrooms) - which included the greens and two kinds of thinly sliced mushrooms in a savory brown sauce (with lots of whole garlic cloves). Wow. In Hawaii, we would say \"broke da mouth\"!A warning - we arrived at 5:30 PM on a Saturday, and a lot of the tables were already reserved (which meant not a lot of tables left for walk-ins). If you have a party of more than 2-4 you might want to call ahead on a weekend.  Even if you have to wait, it will be well worth it!",

Over the summer of 2012 they completely gutted the kitchen and put in all new appliances according to the owner. Home of Gourmet should be considered to be on par with the other respected Chinese venues on campus. In fact, six years ago the current owners of Home of Gourmet once operated Cravings and they they sold cravings to its current ownersThe lunch and dinner serving styles are different. Both are extremely good deals. Lunch is served like a school cafeteria with 6-9 entrees offered that alternate daily. 2 entrees + a ton of white rice + free drink = $5.50.Dinner is fantastic. Variety on the menu is incredible; over 100 different dishes offered. Portion sizes are huge and i think prices are extremely reasonable especially considering 2 people can share most entrees (from the Chinese menu) as a complete dinner. Free Hot Tea.My favorite dishes: The stir fried green beans are unbelievable. They chili oil fish is fantastic if you like spicy food and fish. The \"Indonesian fried rice\" is identical to the jakarta fried rice from cravings. Ma Po Tofu has a truly authentic mala spicy taste. The employees are very willing to tweak any dish to any preferred taste.Downsides: Small venue so it gets extremely crowded noon-1 and 6-7.",

                "review": "I worked here for a few months (August until two days ago).  I was fired on a very contrived reason - I think it was because this place doesn't get enough business.Location is pretty bad for visibility, even if it's convenient to campus.  Food is very average, but I like it more than, say Panda Express.  My parents run a restaurant so I have experience (which is why I was hired in the first place) - this is one of the most inefficiently-run restaurants ever.  The vegetable dishes are good, though, and the Chinese-language menu is generally good quality if you don't mind a wait.  The bosses both cook when necessary, but it's best to come during weekdays, when the main cook is in.  The hot pot is also fairly popular, but most of the meats are frozen.  Other things that are frozen include the \"Wheaten Foods\" menu (potstickers, wontons, and meat buns).  I think that's pretty SOP here in CU, though.Portion sizes are okay.  They definitely shrank in the 3 months I worked there.  I won't analyze pricing, because I'm not used to eating out, but I think most people consider them fair or just slightly overpriced.Things to not get include the highly-Americanized items on the menu, especially those with breaded chicken in them.  The quick lunch was phased out mostly - now it's a selection of two Chinese braised dishes, so they keep pretty well (and have an average turnover).  Instead, they now offer \"Combos,\" which are your standard rice and a main dish, with an egg roll.  They used to give a soda with these, but now only offer iced tea, hot tea, or a small bowl of egg drop or hot and sour soup.  Don't get the soups (including noodle soups) or appetizers unless you really like egg rolls (they're decent but nothing special).  Certain dishes like the pork with mustard greens (P10, IIRC) are frozen, but I think they're probably okay if you don't mind them defrosting/reheating via microwave.  The smoothies and bubble tea are a no-no - they're edible and not too terrible, or so I hear, but go to Evo's or some other place for these; the slushies are okay if you don't mind a lot of sugar.  Most customers seem okay with the fish, but it doesn't look too great to me (aka it smells, and fresh fish doesn't).  To qualify that last statement, it doesn't reek like rotten fish, but you can definitely get a stronger smell than I think is usual when you gut one (I bass fish at home and clean my own catch) - plus, while it's inevitable, it's frozen and quick-defrosted (aka in the sink, in a water bath with direct contact, rather than through a bag).  Hardly sanitary).Like some other reviews have stated, they really do skimp as much as possible on ingredients, equipment, etc.  Ingredients come in on Thursday nights from Far East, and I'm not sure when other ingredients come in.  However, I'd say to come on Friday, because they probably push the old vegetables on Thursday (I only worked TR lunch and Sundays, so I can't say for certain).A few big points about the owners' behavior (which they also try to instill in the workers): first, they will try to dissuade you from getting something that they feel is too much trouble to cook at the moment, never mind if they have all the ingredients ready (usually this is because it's busy); secondly, they do cut corners, as aforementioned.  Another thing that most people probably aren't too concerned about because they aren't very aware of it, is the matter of the \"special soup.\"  They only give it to regular customers, but more generally to any Chinese or Chinese-speaking customers.  If you're not Chinese/speaking-proficiency or a repeat customer who asks, tough luck (I've seen this attitude referred to on foodie blogs as \"soup Nazism\").  A last point on their behavior is that they will lie about what they have and don't have, especially when it comes to drinks or if they feel they're too busy to bother with your order.  Normally this happens with drinks (they keep changing their Combo meals, and they decided to stop giving sodas with them because they didn't want to stock up); they will also refuse to make you a smoothie or other blended drink if they're busy.Basically, they have an undersized facility, an undertrained staff (one of the bosses in particular gets in the way more than he keeps things going), an undersized staff, and basically a very mediocre business model.  I'm kind of astounded they've survived, but if you know what to get, you can get a pretty decent meal here.To conclude, there aren't a lot of repeat customers, but they try to treat the ones they recognize well.  However, I went to Cravings with a friend yesterday, and I saw a lot of former customers that stopped coming there.  I'd say they made a good choice (Cravings has much better service, food, and atmosphere).  Other good Chinese restaurants in the area, in no particular order, include Mandarin and Lai-Lai.  The Wok in Mahomet is legendary among the Chinese on campus, but that's another story",

Chinese menu that hangs above the counter, getting the dry garlic-flavored fish (h12 on the menu).  The fish was nicely fried and covered in lots of little bits of near-charred garlic, ginger, and onions.  It was delicious.  When we go out to eat we usually want to try a bunch of things (and have leftovers), so my husband got lemongrass beef.  If you like peppers, that is the dish for you.  The beef was very peppery tasting, but the lemongrass added a deeper flavor, too.  In spite of not particularly enjoying peppers I found myself stealing bites.As other reviews have said, the portions are large and inexpensive.  Two people could easily eat here for $7.  The restaurant is small and it was crowded when we went.  I'd recommend takeout.",

This place was packed with international students when I came for lunch, and that's how you KNOW it's authentic and quality. The hot & spicy chicken was definitely good. Their tofu dish was also very good. I got to select from maybe 12 pre-prepared dishes for the lunch special (I think they switch the dishes out daily), and I got to pick a side of either rice or rice noodles. I got rice noodles. The amount they gave me was jaw dropping. A lunch special honestly equals about two meals. If you order only two entrees, they pack in more of the entrees to fill the box, so I think it's a better deal to just get two if you don't mind less variety. I was full to the point of feeling sick after trying to finish an entire meal. The lunch special also comes with a free soda or water which makes this place even more so the winner winner chicken dinner. Oh my goodness, how I love Home of Gourmet.",

The food tasted good and the service was very friendly and helpful.For the uninitiated, there are basically three menus here.  I think that maybe if they stuck to one menu, they'd get better ratings.The best menu is their authentic Chinese menu.  This is on the wall to the right as you enter.  It is in both Chinese and in English, but includes almost exclusively authentic Chinese dishes.  The dishes I had were off this menu, were cooked by their Chinese chef, and were excellent - high in flavor, good textures, I'd eat them again anytime.The second menu is on the left as you come in, and this is mostly Americanized Chinese foods.  I think these may not usually be cooked by their Chinese chef, but instead by their non-Chinese workers.The third menu is the menu of Thai items. The owner is Chinese, so while I haven't actually ordered from the Thai menu, I wouldn't expect great things from it.The decor in the place is typical unpretentious Chinese, which is to say plain and frayed at the edges.  Disposable plates and cups don't make much for ambiance, but most inexpensive but authentic Chinese places focus on the food and not the decor.I deliberated on whether to give them three or four stars, but ultimately I've going with four because I did really enjoy the food I had, and the service was very good.  Order off the authentic (right-hand) side of the wall, insist you want it cooked authentically, and I think you'll go home happy.",

The restaurant is set up cafeteria style, with employees serving around 10 different dishes some of which rotate. The braised fish, egg and imitation crab dish, jalapeno chicken, and baby bok choi are wonderful. You get a choice between a large portion of rice or a rice noodle dish to go with it. Oh, and not to mention they have the BEST General Tso's I've ever had. it's not all made of the batter and sauce like most places. You actually taste the chicken here. It is sooo cheap, and you get a mountain of food. I can never finish all of mine! The ladies serving are so friendly as well. If you want, you can ask for a bowl of egg drop soup in place of a drink.There is also a large menu on the wall if you're willing to wait for them to cook you something fresh, but I've always been too drawn in by what I see when I walk in to bother with that.",

I've come here three times now and am excited to add it to my Campustown rotation.  The owner and staff are very friendly and accommodating, and are more than happy to explain dishes to us westerners.  As my friend Matthew G. noted, lunch is served cafeteria style, while you order dinner off of the menu.  The lunch is a great deal, with 3 entrees and rice for about 6 or 7 dollars.  I've been trying to order the more authentic dishes on the lunch menu, and my favorites are the napa cabbage and the dry spicy chicken.  I look forward to coming back again and ordering off of the dinner menu.  It is a small interior with limited seating, so it gets very crowded at peak hours.  The lunch line moves quickly.",

Some of their food can be a bit bland for my tastes, but they'll add more spice to anything if you request it and like a bit more heat. Their General Tso's Chicken and Orange Chicken are probably their two best dishes. I'd also recommend their pot stickers, though the sauce can have a strong garlic taste so be forewarned if that's not your thing. They have an incredibly friendly staff and keep a nice, clean kitchen (which you can see for yourself as you wait for your order) and are a great low-cost alternative for Chinese food in CU.",

I just haven't had anything here I didn't like!Add to that, it's clean (really clean!), organized, pleasant to wait in, and the staff are pleasant and efficient and make you feel welcome.   This is my go-to now!",

I had never been super impressed, but usually mostly satisfied with my food. This, fellow Yelpers, was entirely MY fault. I kept ordering things from the regular menu like sesame chicken and sweet and sour chicken and pork lo mein, expecting awesome. Don't get me wrong, those items are solid, even good. But not socks-off-knocking. The real beauty here is apparently in THE SPECIALS. ORDER THE SPECIALS.We've been to Green Jade twice in the past six weeks. The first visit, I tried the garlic eggplant special. Oh. Wow. I love eggplant, and this was eggplant done right. Well done!The second visit, I was disappointed that there was no eggplant special. Boo. However, they DID have a green bean and pork special. Oh. Wow. So, here's a tip - go to Green Jade. Order one of the specials! Also, if you like soup, they have the best egg drop soup in Champaign.",

I often end up eating my leftovers for lunch and dinner the next day. Their crab ragoon is so good - fried to a crisp, filled full. It is always warm with cool, gooey cream cheese in the center. Even their egg rolls are some of the best I've ever had.The only thing that bothers me (the food is so good, though, I don't even care) is the language barrier. No matter how I phrase it, I always end up with different portions/variations on my dish. I have never gotten the same thing there twice or paid the same price twice. You always get A TON of whatever entree you order, but sometimes you get a small order of rice, sometimes you get a large. Sometimes it's fried rice, whether you say fried or not, and sometimes, you get an egg roll, whether you ask for it or not. So if you think that will bug you, maybe the place isn't for you, but this place has some of the best Chinese food I've ever had. The price is always great for a poor student like me, too; a great Friday night date, Wok take out and a movie on Netflix.",

They never told me how long, said thank you or anything. When I went to pick it up, I was the only customer there and they acted so rude. They also got my order completely wrong. I ordered a pint of beef Lo mien and a small generals tso's chicken. When I picked up my order I got chicken Lo mien (not beef) and a large combo generals tso's chicken with rice and was way over charged. The white rice was disgusting and everything was not as good as everyone has said on here. Definitely not coming back. I'll drive the extra distance to get good Chinese for the same/cheaper price with great service.",

The wonton soup was too salty and the wonton are the same that you expect fried (not the thin translucent dumplings).

They have a full takeout menu and then on the side of the wall they've stapled cardboard to the wall and written specials on it. I don't know how often these change, but they are very reasonably priced ($4-6 and come with rice). I ordered the subgum wonton soup and the hunan vegetables (special). The subgum wonton soup was huge and had vegetables, plump wontons, the most tender white meat chicken I've ever had, slices of roast pork, and big succulent shrimp. The broth was very nicely flavored and I will definitely get it again. The hunan vegetables had snow peas, baby corn, water chestnuts, carrots, broccoli, peppers, and tofu in the delectable hunan sauce (my favorite). This food fed me for two meals, and could feed anyone with a normal appetite more. I will be back many many times.",

I live a few blocks away, and when I make the decision to get Chinese food, I want that Chinese food right then.  First Wok is spectacular in this regard.  One call, a quick run-through of the items I want, and it's done.  This isn't the place you all if you want to hmm and hah through the options.  I've found it best to have everything planned out.  Usually they'll list your order back to you, but sometimes they won't.  Sometimes they'll tell you \"ten, fifteen minutes,\" but most of the time they won't.  But you'll show up fifteen minutes later and your food will be ready to go.And that food will be delicious.  I always order the cashew chicken, the beef with broccoli, the beef lo mein, and some hot and sour soup.  They're all magnificent, in that greasy, inexpensive take-out way, and they're all good reheated for days and days.On the downside, I will note that I have had the smallest of mistakes in my orders.  Once they left out the crunchy things that go on the soup. Another time they game me a small item when I had ordered a large. Nothing major, I was never overcharged, and these are the only such occurrences in close to three years of regular patronage.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",

It wasn't a terrible experience, but judging from many of the other reviews here, I expected better.**Update** So I gave the place a 2nd try (orange chicken) a few months ago which didn't turn out to be that bad, not great, but not bad.  I went there again today, ordered the szechuan chicken and was very dissapointed.  Yet again, supposed to be spicy, yet just tasted like MSG gravy, no flavor, no spice, just umami and cornstarch.  I'm guessing that there are probably dishes that aren't bad, but so far, all I've gotten was bland.  That coupled with the abrupt, bordering on rude woman who works the front desk and I'm not sure if I want to find out what those decent dishes are.",

On the menu itself there are no more vegetarian options than most Chinese places offer.  However, they will vegetarian-ize most of the meat dishes (I got General Tso's Tofu).That said, it was not the greatest tofu I've had--kind of mushy, sauce was a bit watery (...or oily...honestly I couldn't tell which).  It also was not spicy at all.  I'm sure they'll make it spicier if you ask, so if you like your food spicy you should probably request it.  My food tasted alright and was definitely a generous portion, plenty for leftovers.Service was quick and the place looked clean.  The food was just very...average.",

I have heard people rave about Italian restaurants that I, as an Italian, find lacking; so I suspect that someone of Chinese ancestry might think First Wok falls short.  Take that as a caveat.  Anyway, I like their egg rolls and boiled dumplings.  The crab rangoons don't impress.  Their hot and sour soup is good.  Gentle kick to it.  I often get Pork Lo Mein and enjoy that.  Servings are ample.  The General Tsao Chicken is good, as are all the entrees I have tried.  The usual unappetizing photos of their dishes adorn the wall.  I often wonder about those photos.  A friend living in Taiwan sent me a cookbook that was popular there and it contained the same quality photos of the food.  Curious.  The menu lists a plethora of items and the wall has posted another list of dozens of entrees.  What these all are escapes me and there is often a language barrier when asking for an explanation.  Sometimes I feel adventurous and plan to order something I never had before but I always end up going with something familiar.  For a sit-down dinner, I prefer Rainbow Gardens on Neil Street, but for a quick and satisfying Chinese dinner, First Wok should not disappoint.",

We ended up there for lunch yesterday.So, first thing - their fried rice is saffron yellow.. but I guarantee there's no saffron in there. Ack. It's seriously neon.I ordered the eggplant chicken special. I was very excited after recently having some excellent garlic eggplant from Green Jade. I thought, \"Yay! Eggplant Special! Happy Grace!\" As it turns out, I celebrated a bit too soon. The eggplant wasn't thoroughly cooked, making it sort of bitter and tough. Also, they didn't use Chinese eggplant, which was sort of confusing. It was American (globe) eggplant. If it had been Chinese eggplant, I bet it would've tasted a whole lot better. Furthermore, it was advertised as 'spicy.' Ahem. That dish was not spicy in the least. It could've used a few hearty splashes of sriracha. (Coincidentally, that's what I plan to do to the leftovers...)I also got egg-drop soup, which was alright. However, I got some fried noodles with my soup, and was even further disappointed. They were stale and not very good. On the plus side, Husband's duck and broccoli special tasted excellent! The duck wasn't deboned in the least, and seemed like it had just been hacked apart, but after working around the bones, the taste rocked.The service was fast and friendly enough, and the prices were very low - both of us got specials and I got my soup for $12 total. Still, I don't think I'll be back. There are better Chinese food places in C-U.",

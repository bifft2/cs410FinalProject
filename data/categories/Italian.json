My experience this time was much better than the first.I had a coupon for a free small appetizer. Our waitress told us that the amount could be used toward a large size appetizer, which was helpful.Service was very good. Our appetizer was the Cheesy Bread Florentine, which was very good. We followed with the Chopped Antipasto Salad, which was also very good. Our past dish was the Chicken and Sausage Zita, which was heavily spiced and a winner in our book. We had a few drinks which zoomed up the total bill.I was happy that the evening went so well. Although the food was much better this visit, I believe this chain is a tad too pricey for what you get. It would not rate nearly as high as a chain like The Old Spaghetti Factory for value.",

They were hand made and probably the best fried mozzarella I've ever eaten. However, it's $13.99 for 8 of them. That's double the price of most mozzarella appetizers and we could have eaten 2-3 orders of these. But it was delicious.So we ordered another appetizer - the mini meatballs. I was under the impression that they were stuffed with cheese but they weren't. They were pretty decent but we thought they tasted a little odd. We weren't crazy about them.  The portion was small and again, this tiny appetizer was also $13.99, which I find expensive for an appetizer.The house bread with oil and Parmesan was good and we ate a lot of bread. The servers were friendly but were never in a hurry. It wasn't busy at all but we had to wait 15 minutes to get our check once we were done eating. Most of the meal operated at that pace, which I find frustrating. I mean, if my drink is empty, please fill it up now, rather than 15 minutes later!Ok, so onto the main entree: we ordered chicken parmigiana. We ate the smaller order which had 3 big pieces of chicken and was about $20. It was good, although my wife and I weren't crazy about it because it had little onions all over as well as little tomato chunks all over (as opposed to a nice tomato-like sauce that other places typically serve).  All in all, food was pretty good, arguably much more authentic than other Italian places, and it was a good experience. I think this place can be amazing if you find the dishes you really prefer to eat. One other thing: I wanted the usual salad that I had ordered in the past from Bucas and was told by the server that they didn't carry it, although \"all the other Bucas carry it.\" I found that to be a little odd. Anyway, we will return but I'd like to see some improvements.",

Sharing food at the table is a rarity for many families these days, and eating here with my family recreated that, even if just a little bit.

Everything was very good and plenty for our family of 5. Our server was friendly and helpful, having to explain a few things since it was our first time eating there.My only complaint is the somewhat cramped dinning area that is cluttered with decoration.",

However, they are small & may not feed the number of people advertised. On my first go, I ordered their eggplant parmesan. It was so delicious! I ordered a large for $32 so it was meant to serve 4 or more but it was 1.5 servings for me. There were 3 small stacks of eggplant. Maybe my senses of portion size is severely skewed? On another occasion, I ordered the large calamari for 2 people ($30, though meant for 4). It came out on a 6\" oval plate & was overcooked to little crisps. Totally not worth it. While some of the food is good, it is totally overpriced with small portions.",

Other than that, we had an enjoyable experience.",

I've never had a salad here I DID like, which is surprising. It's also disappointing because they do have the family sized servings, so it's a total waste if you're unsatisfied with something. The pasta is always al dente and tastes good. My children are in love with the fettuccine alfredo, but I think it's a little lackluster. I have tried the eggplant parmesan and it was far too chewy and tough to manage. The chicken dishes have always been pleasing and satisfying. Adult beverage selections are limited and pricey compared to other restaurants.Make sure you get the house bread with the balsamic/oil mix. That's the best part of the meal!",

However, my family and I were pleasantly surprised. We started out by meeting our waitress, who despite being very sweet, constantly sounded very aggressive whilst asking us for our orders. \"Would you like a glass of water with that? I said, WOULD YOU LIKE A GLASS OF WATER?!\" Not only were we one placement may short, we had to repeatedly ask for silverware. I proceeded to order a Shirley temple, my classic go-to when I'm trying to lose weight. But alas, the sweet concoction came without a cherry. I tried to move past that, but I have to admit the rest of my meal was quite scarred from the experience. Onto the food. One should we warned that if one would like one's own meal, this is not the place to go. Almost everything is served family style. The six of us decided to order the Caprese Salad, Spicy Chicken Rigatoni, Baked Ziti, and Eggplant Parmesan. the Caprese salad was the most cleanly cut mozzarella I have ever seen. Bravo. As for the pasta, I cannot complain, however the seasonings could have been a bit more present. One of the most dissapointing parts of the meal was when we were given the check with no dessert menu. I didn't order the Shirley temple for nothing, sweet pea. I cannot complain, but next time, I could've used a cherry.",

This is the first time I've ever had a waitress tell me they can't make a pizza the way I want... Which is freaking weird.  This store is very dark it's very hard to read the menu or pick off peppers because the light is so dim. Now that I think about it the place kind of creeped me out.",

I've only gone during lunch time,and both times I've arrived, there hasn't been a hostess to greet me. The first time I went, I had to walk around the restaurant to flag someone down. I usually sit in the bar area and have noticed that other customers have the same experience. The waiters are pretty friendly, which makes up for your initial impression. I've experienced both attentive and not so attentive waiters, but again, overall pleasant customer service. Food is pretty satisfying. You get a good serving size and if you're not too hungry, you can save half of an entree for later. I've had their tomato,basil soup (yum!) and their ziti (double yum!) I definitely crave their ziti every time I go. My boyfriend has had their Spicy Chicken Rigatoni and Chicken Parmesan.  I always try a bit of his food and both of us agree, it's pretty freaking delicious. Only disappointment is their garlic bread (who screws up garlic bread?!) It's really dry and I'm used to really buttery garlic bread. I've also tried the mozzarella garlic bread, which is better, but not the best I've had. Again, I've only been at lunch so I'm not sure how it is when it's busier. You'll have a good experience though.",

One of the best things I have experienced is the celebratory dinning, another great aspect is the family style eating experience, and finally the atmosphere is true and authentic. We went here with a large party, and we all split a numerous amount of dishes. We had plenty of left overs, and all left satisfied. The entire staff was extremely grateful and helpful. We loved our service. Having family style options is great because everyone communicates about each dish and the party really stays lively. This establishment really nailed it when it comes to aesthetics. The restaurant really looks like an authentic Italian restaurant. Also, what a top end liquor selection. They had every wine imaginable and a full bar. We really like Buca and hope everyone makes a visit in. IT'S WORTH IT. Go in to Buca in Champaign for a great experience.",

The restaurant was quite empty, so I was leery of the food quality and freshness; however, this place was surprisingly very good. The server was courteous and helpful. I ordered a Greek salad and a chicken parmigiana. The salad was DELICIOUS and plentiful. It almost could have been a meal. The parmigiana was PK, not the greatest, but it served its purpose and it was \"hot\". Something very important many restaurant servers overlook - \"guys, the food needs to be hot when you serve it\". The place looks nice with Frank and Dino playing in the background... I recommend this place",

I made reservations and arrived early and they were able to accommodate us. After warmly greeting us, we made our way to the table. Throughout our meal, the staff were very attentive and checked in on us very often for refills and making sure we were enjoying the food. Here's what we had:-warm baguette and focaccia rolls: freeeeee! -calamari-toasted ravioli-shrimp and salmon milanese served with risotto (fish was cooked very well and shrimp was succulent)-sea bass with cauliflower pure -cheese and prosciutto stuffed pork chop with asparagus-lobster pizza (my fav - crust was buttery and lobster was so tender)Overall, I had an amazing experience! Highly recommend this place!",

One thing I love at any restaurant is when the server brings over a drink refill before you even ask for one. I know it's a small thing, but it's that kind of attention that makes all the difference. The food was amazing! I had the black fettuccine with lobster and a bit of a chicken salad dish as well.

We love to eat here because my son loves the mac and cheese with a scoop of ice cream, and I get to eat some real food- so it's a good compromise. But, when a large party was being seated in our section as our server was just delivering drinks to the table nearby, my son started wondering loudly if he would ever get the promised ice cream.  The manager was wonderful- He jumped in and within a minute we had the ice cream, take out box, and bill.  We come here a couple of times of month. The strawberry lemonade is delicious, and there are lots of healthy options on the menu- Great salads and they willingly substitute marinara sauce for the fettuccini alfredo that accompanies many dishes.  I am a fan of a louder, busy atmosphere, which this restaurant has- It's always busy. It is a great way for families to get out to a nice dinner where the white tablecloths are covered with paper for coloring on.The service on this visit was not as good as usual, but it was just a timinig issue and not at all the server's fault. The manager saved the experience by jumping in and getting us taken care of like he did.The curbside take out is fast and easy too. Much appreciated!",

Thanks for a good run. FACTS: I started coming here in 1999 when it opened. This was after making several trips from Champaign to the Bloomington location--Good Times and  Great Food with Friends...the business was built on the ethic of solid food and exceptional service. I personally knew most of the 'opening' management staff in Champaign....and I am still connected  with several of them.  Things have changed and not for the better!On a regular basis I eat here 2-3 times a week. Yes, that is a lot. But, in the past I have appreciated the convenience and location to work. No more passing over the the lack of constancy with food and service. This evening we were served cold/warm soup, cold pasta, cold under cooked vegetables (that the manager calmed was due to a menu change). With tonight's experience I doubt I will ever go back. Cold food, under cooked food, and an arrogant manager. No Thanks.",

Ambience is similar to Macaroni Grill (open space, higher ceilings).Nice warm bread served right away, to be dipped in olive oil.  My fellow diners loaded up their olive oil with grated parm, also on the table, before dipping.I went with the Lobster Corn Chowder to start - large bowl of sweet, creamy soup with chunks of lobster and vegetables.  My main was the Roasted Beet and Arugula Salad.  Beautiful presentation and a decent size for an entree if you aren't starving (or you've already eaten a big bowl of soup and two pieces of bread).  In addition to the beets and arugula, this salad also had avocado chunks and dried cherries plus three rounds of Montchevre goat cheese coated with spicy ground walnuts.  I went with our waitress's recommendation and subbed the Honey Balsamic dressing that was supposed to accompany my salad with a creamy Italian-type.  Very nice all around.My fellow diners chose the Chicken Piemontese (her favorite - chicken breast stuffed with ham and cheese in a lemon butter sauce, with potatoes and veg), the Filet Mignon (which was a decent 8oz size and looked well prepared, served with potatoes and veg), and the Rigatoni alla Toscana (pasta in red sauce with sausage, onions and peppers).  I wish I could have tempted them to try an appetizer or two because this part of the menu looked very nice.  I may have to go back alone and try one - Bacon Wrapped Dates or Tomato Mozzarella Caprese - with a glass of wine, at the bar.",

The servers are knowledgeable on the food and the vast wine selection. Be sure to ask for Kyle's section of he is there. He won't let you down in pairing the perfect wine with anything you want to eat. I make sure to try their specials every time I'm in there. The risotto is almost always on point. It can be pricey if you aren't paying attention, but the food is well worth it. With the remodel, I was hoping they'd update the bathrooms but they still seem tacky to me. But if that's my only complaint, you know I believe in this restaurant. Five stars (4.5 if I could - due to the bathrooms and the priciness, but it's way better than Olive Garden.)",

The hostesses, while very polite, seemed a bit over zealous.  There were 2 and they both kept telling me the same things right after another. just seemed a bit \"in your face\".I had the lobster soup, bread and hot tea to begin with. The soup was fantastic and I loved that they bring out a box of tea for you to choose from. The bread was a bit of a let down, old and cold. As an entre I had the fettuccine with lobster. While the menu stated chili flakes, there were none.  The dish was just overall bad. Pasta was over cooked while having clumped pieces that were underdone. The real downer was the lobster sauce. It was ruined with the ungodly amount of green onion they used, all I could taste was onion. My server was David and he was outstanding. Very gracious, offered to take the dish back and get me something else and he would bring up my dislikes at a meeting. Decent experience,  I would return to try something else possibly and get the soup for sure.",

I have also tried my fair share of different dishes on their menu and have never been disappointed. I had the chicken parmesan the last time I went in February, but just about anything you order will be delicious. I would recommend making a reservation ahead of time because it can get very crowded especially on the weekends, or even during the weekdays. Sometimes there are different kinds of events and people may go to Biaggi's in a big group afterwards so it doesn't hurt to be on the safe side and make a reservation.",

On top of that it is just to expensive for what you get.  That fake, country rustic vibe is prevalent throughout.  Service is cheerful and peppy.  For a large group they did fine.  Everything from the kitchen came out at the same time.  Which is professional, though some things were cold.  Understandable, but I wish places like this would just bring the food out when it is hot.  Maybe I am alone in that regard, because most places will do this.  Anyway, that really is not a big deal.They shout from the highest high top table that everything is freshly made or sourced here.  If that is true, they need better sources or they need to make better pasta.  Just the typical over stuffed pasta dishes that are found in most Italian places.  The scallops are bad.  Rubbery, chewy, and flavorless.  The salads are not that good...the dreaded and bland Caesar, house, and wedge.  Calamari is dry, rubbery, and flavorless.  Average wine list, and a crappy beer list.  Both pretty typical for such a place.  There are not a lot of great options for Italian in Champaign/Urbana/Savoy.  This place certainly has that faux chain look that draws people in by the masses.  Which is probably why they have been open for so many years.  Though just an upscale Olive Garden.  Manzella's is about the same, with a much friendlier, welcoming vibe (if a bit dated), and better bang for your buck IMO.",

Well, when you go with little expectation and those expectations are exceeded on nearly every point, it's worth an extra star or two!I won't belabor all the details, but the place was bustling and our server was conscientious and helpful.  The wine list was surprisingly extensive and we enjoyed a little-known (to me) \"Lemberger\" red wine from Austria.  Light, almost pinot noir-like.  Very nice.  The appetizers were pretty good - fried calamari was crisp and tender but a very small portion.  The seafood arancini were not very good.  I had the spinach salad which was a bit oily but delicious.  For my main course, I had the special Tuscan cassoulet which was a hearty and savory braise of beans, rabbit sausage, chicken and duck confit.  It was simply delicious, not something I would expect at a chain Italian restaurant.  Such an unexpected treat - I think I can still taste it!My dinner companions generally enjoyed their food as well.  Our desserts were competently executed including tiramisu, chocolate cake, and bananas foster (no flambe though).",

I also found that their lasagna (all 8 layers of it) is reallllly good. I usually try to order something new every time I go to a restaurant, but this lasagna has me hooked. But, if I can tear myself away from the lasagna, or rather, any of the pasta dishes, I've found the salads are pretty great and they're HUGE. The wedge is one of my favorites, but any of them are really good, actually.The iced tea is also suuuper good, and so is the strawberry lemonade. There are mashed strawberries in it and it's perfectly sweet and tart. I love it.Also, the nuttela skillet cookie with ice cream, holy cow. Make sure you order it, but do it early because it takes about 10 minutes to make. It's worth the wait though. It's phenomenal!I also can't review this place without saying how nice the staff has always been here. Everyone is very polite, very proper, and you feel comfortable here wether you're in jeans and a shirt for a lunchbreak or here for a fancy dinner. It's just good for any occasion.Basically yeah, I feel kind of stupid ranting and raving about a chain restaurant, but it really is one of my favorite places in Champaign and I'm reminded of that every time I go here.",

Makes the whole dining experience that much better. The drinks: I'm a Jameson fan, so there's really not much you can mess up on there, but my wife seems to love the wine so I'll take her word for it. Haven't tried anytihng else though.The food: One word, GREAT. Obviously, being an italian restaurant, I expected the food to be bland, but oh my god, was it good! Its got flavor and they'll go out of their way to change the dishes to your tastes (in my case, SPICY). Great place overall, but what makes it so good is the wait staff. I can't tell you how important this small thing is for me because it can seriously make or break a lot of restaurants. I believe there is a Biaggi's in Naperville also, although I haven't tried them out yet so I really can't say much, but one day (I mean hell, it is a lot closer than Champaign!).",

Dishonesty and abysmal customer service.My wife and I hosted a party for 40 of our closest friends and family.  We pre-arranged for each guest to be able to order whatever they wanted off the menu.  This included appetizers, entrees and desserts.  Dinner went off well up until the dessert part.The guests were all given dessert menus and as they began to order desserts, I was pulled aside and told that they ran out of most of the desserts.  Strange, I thought.  How they heck do you run out of creme brulee?! The manager explained that they had been very busy the night before and simply ran out of most everything.  However, they still had cheesecake, chocolate cake, and lemon tower cake.Again, strange.  So they ran out of everything OTHER than the stuff that could be easily sliced and flopped on a plate for the least amount of effort.Bullshit.Indeed, we were informed by one of the kinder and more empathetic waitresses that this was a complete and utter lie.  Not only did they not run out of desserts, but they were serving them to other patrons at the restaurant.  Heck, one of our guests was even able to score the bread pudding before we were unceremoniously cut off like a drunk at closing time.I would love for somebody to explain to me why the $1,200 I spent was not good enough to: A) get what I specifically arranged for IN ADVANCE; and B) at least get the common courtesy of an honest explanation.Would I have been upset if they had told me they simply could not do the volume of desserts we were asking for?  Of course, but I would have understood, and they would not have lost me as a customer.The real problem is that this could have been dealt with when we arranged the party.  We were promised one thing, and they refused to deliver on that promise.  As it stood, we told our guests to make sure they saved room SPECIFICALLY FOR the wonderful array of desserts that would be available.  I cannot explain the disappointment on the guests faces who were given dessert menus and had wanted to order tiramisu or bread pudding, but were then told that they could not have it.  Of course, we look like the cheapskates who wouldn't spring for the good stuff.  It wrecked what should have been a special occasion.  My wife and I spent more time farting around with the dishonest manager and chef than we did with our guests.  Pathetic.I have had two parties there and countless dinners and lunches.  I will never go back.",

I enjoyed their Caesar dressing, it's pleasantly spicy and creamy. The stuffed mushrooms were also pretty good. For entrees, everyone at my table ordered the Capellini Di Mare. The saucing was a little inconsistent across the three plates. Mine was a bit watery while the other two seemed a bit drier. The pasta was a little soggy. Also, all of us had 1-2 closed mussels. Disappointed that they didn't notice this during plating and served us inedible mussels. However, they were nice and brought us out some fresh ones to replace them. Other than the saucing inconsistencies and the mussel fiasco, the portions were huge and the dish was for the most part good. Overall, my dinner at Biaggi's was just okay, but I knew what to expect coming to the chain Italian restaurant.",

I think it's a great place to feel like you're better than you really are, or just different from any other family restaurant, but that's only because of the dress code and presentation. The food is fine. Their steaks are high-grade, but usually tough unless they are smothered in some strange sauce that smells, looks, and tastes funky. So you're stuck if you go with or without the sauce. I did enjoy their pork chops, though. Garlic mashed potatoes are tasty, too. Appreciate the bread baskets, but whether or not the bread actually tastes fresh is a touch-and-go issue. I dig the Champaign bartenders, though. Props to those charming folks. Strawberry daquiris are magnificent... They know how to get the tips flowing. Best way to go with Biaggi's is only use it for gift certificates or spoiling someone else on a birthday. I would never go with a group of friends \"just for fun,\" but I regularly give out their gift cards as thank you gifts.",

Their delicious homemade bread and oil/pepper/parmesan they put out on the tables before your entrees is reason enough to come. I would say its closest competitor/comparison would be Olive Garden, but you get a higher quality meal at a slightly lower price here.One great option is getting a half-portion (my dates here have always loved this) where you can get a half-portion of your favorite pasta for 8.99. And it is more than enough to fill up most ladies! I highly recommend Biaggi's for a date night or nice family dinner.The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the noise. They have never done a great job of sound-proofing their restaurants and during peak hours it can get quite noisy.",

Our initial waitress mysteriously disappeared after getting our drinks... another waiter took over and said that the other waitress had to \"take off.\" This was kind of confusing, because we saw her waitressing other tables right by us. Plus, I never like it when there are about 5 different people stopping by your table. One guy asked if we wanted more bread, and we said yes, and then he never brought the bread basket back. Different people brought out our dishes... and, nearing the end our waiter kept asking us if we needed anything (we were just sitting there talking), which made us feel like he wanted us to leave. I think we would have understood this had it been extremely busy and a long wait, but there was hardly anyone there!",

I wouldnt recommend this place, if you dont like pasta/noodles all that much. I stereotypically end up having the Bruchetta Classico (my favorite item in the menu) for an appetizer and the Chelean Sea Bass for an entree whenever i visit this place.

It has a dark and romantic atmosphere that is nice for date night, but casual enough to bring your family after that U of I special occasion.  The food and prices are where it loses some stars for me.  The entrees are a little pricey and on top of that, all the sides are a la carte. Even though the food is good, I do not think it is good enough to justify the prices.  I think this restaurant gets away with charging so much because it is located in a college town that does not have many high quality restaurants.  The entrees I would recommend and that are worth the money are: the ravioli quattro formaggi, the lamb chops, and (I believe this is only on special) the quarter duck.",

We sat at our table for over 10 minutes and no service. Not even an acknowledgment. Finally flagged someone down and they said our server would be with us shortly.  FINALLY, our server came by.  We ordered our drinks...nothing fancy just 1 beer, a soda' and an Arnold Palmer.  We also placed our order.  2 salads and a soup then our entrees. Drinks came and we drank them and we waited...waitress nowhere in site. Not sure how long it took her to come back, but it was long enough that we were all irritated.  We asked about our salads, and soup.  She said it would be out shortly.  It wasn't!  By now it's like 9:15.  We were not happy.  Finally about 10 min later our salads, etc came out.  Still no entrees.  We asked to speak with a manager.  He came by, we explained the situation.  Thank god, my husband did the talking cuz he's much more dignified than I am. LOLManager apologized and said he had a BRAND new kitchen staff and they were still adapting, etc.  WTF...really dude!!!  Oh by the way, did I mention this was a Friday night!  The manager also said he felt really bad and dinner was on him.  Very nice gesture, but that didn't make up for the fact that we spent our entire evening sitting at Biaggi's.  Our dinner finally came out at 9:45.  By the time we left it was 10:15.  The whole evening was a disaster.  Bottom line...horrible experience and we will probably not go to Biaggi's again.",

My friend ordered a scallion special off the menu which was came in a delicious sauce and I had the penne sardi which was alright (there was too much going on with the bread crumbs and the caramelized onions). I would recommend getting the white chocolate banana pudding for the dessert. Overall, I would recommend going to place again for their great staff even though the food is a little pricey.",

The only issue is that Biaggis tends to be a smaller place with a huge following. On game nights, proms, graduations, and moms/dads weekends the restaurant becomes horribly packed and loud. The servers all do a great job to accommodate everyone. I'd recommend for the weekends such as graduation to make reservations months in advance. A nice perk is that Biaggis does rent out rooms. I love the outdoor seating in the summer too. I'm sad I only have 1 year left at U of I. Definitely will have to get my fill of Biaggis!",

The menu was varied and I loved the food and was pleased to be able to have a half order of any pasta of my choosing.We went with a large group and were seated in the back dining room.  It was rather loud, because they put all the big groups together and we were sandwiched between a wedding party and a group of students celebrating their return to campus.Still, I have to say that I really liked the food at Biaggi's on this Saturday evening.  The wine list for Pinot Noir was great and my wine selection was very nice.  I had a wonderful half order of butternut squash ravioli and their amazing beet, goat cheese and arugula salad, which comes on a long platter.  However, this is the kind of food I can enjoy in large quantities and I did manage to share it at the table, although some didn't quite seem to know what to do with the arugula.  That was fine, as there were a few of us who were happy to finish it.  Wish I could have some of that salad right now.  I would definitely eat at Biaggi's again and perhaps ask for the first dining room as it may be a bit less noisy, although I can't say this for sure since I didn't eat in main dining room.The wait staff was very helpful, friendly and managed our large group exceptionally well.",

This occasion was a luncheon to honor my staff for their continued efforts and they wanted Biaggi's.  We were a party of ten and the service was prompt and courteous and friendly.  The bread placed on the table was okay and the olive oil and cheese was of modest quality.  I started with the Bacon Wrapped Dates (who can resist bacon) and they were quite good.  Nice blend of salty and sweet and the bacon perfectly done.  Followed that with the Stuffed Pork Loin that was served with asparagus spears and garlic mashed potatoes.  All were nicely done.  Everyone at the table had something different and all enjoyed their meals.  One person ordered a half size order of Spaghetti Marinara which was ample.  Can't imagine a full sized one.  All the portions were of good size.  I opted for Bananas Foster for dessert and it was just okay, nothing remarkable.  Prices were reasonable, the ambiance comfortable and inviting, noise level was moderate.Second Visit:Went to dinner here tonight and it didn't start off well. I was seated and then ignored.  I finally asked the hostess if they intended to provide me with a server.  One was provided, a very capable and sweet young woman named Cara who took good care of me the rest of the evening. I started with the Bacon Wrapped Dates that made such an impression on me during my first visit.  The bacon was a bit underdone this time but still tasty.  I ordered the Chicken Piemontese and it was okay, lacking seasoning.  The asparagus again nicely done and the roasted potatoes done well.  Treated myself to dessert tonight.  Ordered some espresso and a glass of Sambuca, which surprisingly came in the traditional Italian way with three coffee beans (Sambuca con la mosca = Sambuca with the flies).  It is said that the beans represent health, happiness, and prosperity. Nice touch.  Had planned to have the Lemon Tower Cake but had a mental lapse and instead ordered the cannoli, which had a nice, crisp shell and nice garnish, but the filling was now what I am accustomed to.  As I finished, Jamie, a managing partner, came over and engaged me in conversation about the food, etc.  He was very pleasant and courteous, gave me his card, and told me to let him know of my next visit and we'd talk food and wine.  I don't think he knew of my \"connections\" so I assume the gesture was genuine.  I will take him up on the offer.  He showed rispetto.",

But what do you expect, it's definitely NOT homemade Italian food, which I guess no chain can compare to.  And if that is what you're expecting, this is not the place to go.  I guess I can start with things that I have found enjoyable in the past when not given the choice of places to go with a big group.  I had on occasion gotten the capellini di mare and found it acceptable for what it is.  A spicy seadfoodie tomatoey veggie sauce with a few scallops and shrimp and some squid. And a mound of pasta... mostly pasta very little seafood and for I think it was $17... yikes. (Not that you would expect fresh seafood but the shrimp were salty as if they had been but in a brine to take away their old seafood taste)  I also have gotten the wedge salad which tasted fine but was nothing special.  The lobster squid ink pasta is something I regularly got as well.  The kids menu was $7 for a bland \"pizza\".Honestly, I would just recommend to avoid the place completely.I would say the last 5 times (4 too many) throughout the past 2 years the service has been AWFUL.  I've encountered a very rude waitress who insulted the person paying for the meal as she was handing him the check.  Another time, when they were dead and we had been waiting a very long time for our food, I ran to the bathroom with my 3 year old and found her sitting in the back party room with her phone out texting/something who knows!  When I got back to the table our food still hadn't arrived.  Which this doesn't make sense to me because usually there are runners, but maybe not during the day when they are slow?  Anyway.. she finally came out with our food which had clearly been sitting under a heat lamp for a VERY long time.  I had gotten a half and half pasta/salad.  My pasta had a film over the sauce from sitting and the salad was hot and wilted from sitting on the same plate under the lamp.  Again recently I ended up here when someone else was taking us out.  Two servers came up to us and claimed the other was being trained so they would both be helping us.  I thought great!.. with two we may get semi decent service.  We ordered our food, and when it came out, the pasta the person to my side had ordered came out not as it is supposed to be.  She had ordered the black pasta, which I must say has a texture to it and appeal that a normal boxed linguine does not.  The runner said \"oh.. your server didn't tell you\" and we said no and that the pasta was one of the main components of the dish.  She said nothing more, didn't offer to change it or see if she wanted something else and just kind of wandered away.  Maybe she should have been more up front about how disappointed she was when the server came back to ask how everything was, but oh well, just another nail in the coffin.Bread and pasta are cheap!  I could make any of the dishes they serve, in my own home, for a few dollars and with a lot more taste! I am done with you Biaggis.",

We were seated in a large private room where more of the bigger parties were situated.Service was fast and accurate.I ordered the Messina salad which was basically a \"Greek\" with olives, feta, onion and olive oil.  Very nice and very ample.  My entree was a stromboli which was just okay.  Everyone else had a pasta dish and everybody was very pleased.  Most had \"half-orders\" which I definitely recommend for females but if you're a man with an appetite you can definitely handle the \"whole.\"My only real complaint is that the temperature in our area was set to \"freeze\" which was fine during the salad phase but the entrees didn't stay warm for long once they arrived.  At some point in the meal one of the other tables must have commented because the A/C went idle for a few minutes and it made an immediate difference.Prices were very fair and they gladly packaged leftovers.We dined at 4 p.m. and there was staff galore to handle about 50% capacity.

While I have a lot of complaints, the complementary bread is excellent and the desserts don't disappoint. Try not to get too attached to a specific dessert though, because they change up the menu on occasion. Also, I like how they display the calories to each dish on the menu and offer a lighter section for those of us who don't feel like breaking the calorie bank before dessert. ;)I think Biaggi's has a lot of potential, but just needs to work out some of their kinks.",

The filet mignon was cooked well but could've had a better flavor. Also, it was annoying to eat asparagus that was cut up into tiny pieces, instead of just whole spears.  The best part of the whole meal was the bottle of Moscato we shared and the dessert, a Nutella skillet cookie.",

                "review": "I do not consider myself a food snob, I am just as happy getting a Wendy's 1/4 lb. cheeseburger as I am trying some new food fad.  I do however expect for a restaurant to do their very best at what it is they do.  And Biaggi's does not do Italian any better than Olive Garden and does so as at an over-inflated price.  I really do not like to give low ratings.  I try my best to find the silver lining in most things but the only silver lining at Biaggi's is the atmosphere.        I had several friends that gushed about the food and how Biaggi's is one of the best restaurants in the Champaign-Urbana area.  I think I need to find a new class of friends after trying Biaggi's.      The wait was not bad for a Wednesday night without reservations.  The staff were friendly and attentive.  The atmosphere of Biaggi's is very nice, white linen table cloths, candles, sturdy table and chairs.   We were presented with a basket of sliced Italian bread and dipping oils after we were seated and it was a nice presentation.       I ordered stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer and they were not bad.  They were swimming in oil but if you used the Italian bread to sop it up, they were really very tasty.  I ordered the Garlic Shrimp Oreganata and my SO ordered the Sea Scallop Risotto.  Disclaimer here:  I did not know that Biaggi's was a chain restaurant until after our visit.      The main entrees took a while to come out and I had finished my Caesar salad and mushrooms and was eyeing my husbands bread when they finally did come out.  The salads that came with dinner were large and the lettuce was fresh and crispy.  The Caesar dressing tasted like Kraft but it's salad so I'm not really complaining.   My Garlic Shrimp Oreganata tasted like Chef Boy-Ar-Dee tossed with salad shrimp.  It was lukewarm and terrible.  My husbands Sea Scallop Risotto was also lukewarm and the scallops were few and far between.  The Risotto was actually good and they did put plenty of \"lump\" meat crab in the dish.  For the time it took them to microwave these frozen meals (and you can tell) I would have expected them at least to be hot.      It is a shame that the food was sub-par because the atmosphere is definitely elegant and much nicer than taking your loved ones to Olive Garden (which I love, remember no food snobbery here!)    The fact that this is a national chain restaurant is equally disappointing:  the meh food is now nationwide!        If you are looking for authentic Italian, this is about Italian as Pizza Hut.  Try Minneci's or  or even Manzella's.  If your looking for atmosphere, they have a nice wine and liquor list and enjoy a few drinks but I cannot recommend the food.  And I definitely did not enjoy it.",

In fact, they are pretty good sometimes because you know there is going to be consistent ambiance and you will not be in for a surprise, there is bound to be a regular dish off the menu that you like and always order and so on. We went to Biaggi's for dinner. After we were seated, a friendly waiter came up to us and while he was greeting us, explaining what the menu of the day was, he was preparing a dressing of olive oil with cheese and pepper on a small plate simultaneously (talk about multitasking..). After taking our orders for appetizers, warm bread was served. There were two types of bread- one was a regular bread, the other one was.. i dont remember actually. My husband got a soup - vegetable soup and it was extremely tasty! For main course, I got the penne sardi without the chicken and my husband got the eggplant parmiagana. The penne sardi turned out be the best penne I have ever had so far. With the flavor of breadcrumbs and garlic with a hint of tomato creamy sauce, this was absolutely great! And, after getting to know the fact that they were a chain, i was pleasantly surprised, since the overall experience of service, food was way beyond expectation compared to any other chain. They have a good selection of deserts. But their main course is so filling that you end up taking the food home and leave without tasting the deserts.They have a good selection of wine too and usually, there are suggestions available for pairing with your food as well. When you enter the restaurant, you will find a lot of business cards on a table. These happen to be the business cards of the different chefs working in the kitchen. I found this pretty neat :)The downside of this place is the food is a little over priced. But I would highly recommend this place for italian food.",

I had a small Caesar salad that was not the best I've ever had, but it was good. For entrees, my husband had spaghetti and meat balls and I had Farfalle Alfredo. They were served promptly. Mine could have been a little hotter, but it was OK and very tasty. The foccacia in their bread basket is DELISH! We did not have dessert, but they sounded very inviting. The atmosphere was very cozy. The only complaint was the large family sitting at the table beside us who allowed on of their children to cry instead of taking him out.

I ordered the filet as usual even though I noticed the price had increased by about 30%!!I could live with that but it turns out that even though the price had increased substantially, the quality had decreased substantially. The plating did not look as I remember it looking. There was hardly any sauce. The sun dried tomatoes were decimated. There was hardly any asparagus and very few potatoes. With the substantial price increase I would think they could have maintained or increased the quality. Biaggis is no longer a preferred destination for us.",

Our waiter was a friendly guy but it didn't make up for the fact that the Alfredo sauce on my pasta was absolute crap. As a proud Italian American I'm pretty sure the sauce they put on my pasta was either out of a can or made in such a bulk that they need copious amounts of water. Either way the sauce was absolutely disappointing and not worth the price. My Caesar salad was also a major let down. With zero to little dressing on it and for some reason over seasoned pepper on it. If you like pepper this is your salad, if your like me and expect you c. Salad to be creamy and delicious you should just avoid it.The bread was fantastic so I guess they have that going for them..

                "review": "While it is a chain, they do a fairly good job of hiding it.  Having heard a lot about this place from friends, I finally decided to give it a try.  My friend and I made a reservation for 5 in accordance to the warnings from friends that this place can get really busy.When we arrived though, there were only a handful of businessmen at the bar, and the dining area was completely vacant.  By the time we left though, barely an hour later, this place was completely packed so I would definitely recommend a reservation unless you plan on eating an early dinner.They have a nice selection of breads for you to munch on while waiting for your entree, but despite the fact there were only a few other diners, the food came out rather slowly and my dish was lukewarm (I had the Chicken Cannelloni).  It was pretty good, but would've been better if I had gotten it hot.The ambiance could be romantic I suppose, if that's what you're looking for, but if you really want to impress your date, I suggest going somewhere downtown Champaign/Urbana.  There's a mixture of people who go there, from casual college students out for a nicer meal with their parents to businessmen and women grabbing a drink after work.Overall, not a bad place to have dinner.  The service was very good (nice, attentive waiters), the food's pretty good, and it still allows for easy conversation despite the fact that it gets very busy.  3-1/2 stars.",

This place can get really busy though so I'm sure they can't all be perfect all the time. I prefer going for lunch versus dinner time anyways. The food is pretty good and definitely better tasting than a certain other Italian chain in town. The pasta is always cooked perfectly and if I get fish it's always moist and tender and tastes pretty fresh. Prices are reasonable (but that doesn't mean cheap). The restaurant itself looks really nice. My favorite part is that the tables are covered in paper and they give my kids crayons to keep them busy long enough for my hubby and I to enjoy our meal relatively peacefully. Also, the kids' menu looks pretty good even though we only get the mac n' cheese for the little ones. Note:  the kids' mac n' cheese is NOT from a box (I think). It has swirly pasta and a homemade-tasting cheese sauce that my kids love, and we like it too!",

The food isn't just the normal \"Italian\" food offerings. They have a few unusual things which make this place better in my book.The bread they serve is great because they serve both a normal Italian bread and a focaccia. The first night I ordered the Chicken Pietro which was amazing. It was really one of the better chicken dishes I have ever ordered. I didn't want the vegetables that came with the dish and they had no problems substituting then for a different vegetable medley.  The second night I ordered the Salmon and Shrimp Milanese. Again, it was very tasty, and the risotto it came with was truly delicious.I was very pleased with both of my meals and if I am every around a Biaggi's again, I will try to eat dinner there.",

Good food that is perhaps a little pricey but definitely a step above most other chain places like Olive Garden.We came in on a Wednesday and the place seemed to be fairly crowded, but it's big on the inside so luckily we didn't have to wait at all.We kept it simple as usual and just ordered 2 entrees between us. We took advantage of the interchangeable sauces and noodles on some of the dishes. I got the farfalle alfredo but substituted the sauce for the lobster cream sauce, while she got a Bolognese with fettuccine noodles and red sauce. Mine was quite tasty, the chicken breast was cooked perfectly and had a good texture to it, the pancetta chunks added a nice texture, and the lobster sauce, although perhaps a little too soupy, added a nice seafood touch to the dish. She said the Bolognese was also very good.The service was spectacular. Our server Jake was particularly friendly and humorous. He had a very strong knowledge of the menu, specials, recommendations, etc. I felt bad we are pretty basic diners and don't really ask too many questions or even order more than just entrees. What a great guy!Overall, a good experience at Biaggi's, I'll definitely come again to try something else.",

                "review": "I have a long history with Biaggi's restaurant, going all the way back to when they built the first one in Bloomington.  That place was about 100xs better than the one they built in Champaign, but only for this reason-- the Biaggi's in Bloomy had a... the best way to describe it was \"module\", where they had all these incredible salad ingredients lined up.  You walked up to the beginning (sort of like a Subway setting, only huge metal bowls of fresh ingredients, not small plastic bins/crocks), and the person at the counter would grab a fresh (clean) metal bowl.  You'd start out with your choice of lettuces/spinach/etc., move on to toppings (with more than a dozen to choose from), and then finally get a home made (right there in front of you) dressing that... let me tell you, was OUT OF THIS WORLD.  So amazing!But, that was the Bloomington store, of course.  Biaggi's in Champers was different from the get go.  A GIANT room constructed from a wooden polymer that was designed to cut down on noise and echoing!  Super smart.  Not sure it really helped, like a lot of people will often complain, the place is like an echo chamber, but... acoustics were a concern from the start.Biaggi's had always prided themselves on being Southern Italian.  That meant that you'd never catch them with a Fetuccini Alfredo on their menu.  I got chewed out for asking if they ever did one, once, at this location. =P  It was during a business dinner, too, so it was good and embarrassing! =P  But it appears, via their online menu (that they do them, now =P  Gee, thanks for that, Biaggi's!)With the Southern thing, though, you always get a delicious italian bread at the start of the meal, along with an amazing extra extra virgin olive oil, sprinkled liberally with parmesan cheese.  Sort of a do it yourself alfredo, right? ;D  Maybe not!  Delicious nonetheless! Biaggi's has always gone out of their way to make unique, delicate, and very refined dishes.  The raviolis are a house specialty, and a guest favorite, I know that much.  My sister flies from California for the Butternut Squash!  During one dinner party, we did have a waiter who accidentally had a coffee carafe (they were talking about changing them out at the time, so they probably have by now, as the design they had on these things was a nightmare!  The servers said they burned themselves on them ALL THE TIME) explode in her hands, which led to coffee running down the back of a guest's chair, straight onto their $200 coat.  Biaggi's gave them a voucher for a free cleaning, without any guff, and then said that if the stain wouldn't come out, they'd pay for a new one!  I thought that was so upstanding, I added an extra star for it, otherwise I would have rated the restaurant (and the overall experience) a 3.  The final point worth mentioning is that Biaggi's is not cheap.  Think Olive Garden prices, but smaller (not necessarily a bad thing), more refined meals.  And if you plan to drink, it's only gonna get worse.  There are a few places where drinking out is still viable, but this restaurant is not one of them!",

You see, we were in Bloomington for the Track Tournament at Wesleyan University.  We were tired, the kids were sweaty (I'm being nice) and HUNGRY and did I mention we were loud?  Well, we were given a private room, I presume in hopes of keeping the noise level down for the other patrons. Hahahaha well, it was worth the try.  Anyway, I digress, on to the service. We were assigned 5 waiters/waitresses.  They moved seamlessly throughout the private dining area, taking orders, filling and refilling beverage requests, bringing bread and conversing with us. HOW they managed to do all that AND get us in and out of there in under two hours is beyond me!The FOOD. The food was DELICIOUS!  Maybe it had something to do with the fact that we were on day two of eating food out of a cooler, but I sincerely doubt that. My husband ordered the Chicken Pimietro (I know I spelled that wrong). It was melt in your mouth good. Yes, I stole some off his plate (don't judge me). Hmmm, I hope he never reads my yelps and discovers my dirty little secret.  I, on the other hand, opted for the Chicken Pietra (succulent chicken breast stuffed with Smoked Gouda and Ham). This was served with asparagus and I asked for Herb Roasted Potatoes instead of the garlic mashed listed on the menu. Don't worry, I didn't actually eat them, I traded my potatoes for my hubby's zucchini and squash. All I can say is.....Why isn't there one of these in MD? Oh wait, I think another yelper said it was along the lines of Maggianos, but I can't say I agree. The atmosphere was different (better), the menu was less overwhelming in regards to choices and the customer service was spectacular. If I ever find myself back in Bloomington (read that as see you next year), I will definitely be stopping by WITHOUT the track entourage!",

It just seems a lot for a chain restaurant..My self and my boyfriend were here recently, I am not always inclined to go to Italian restaurants - being on gluten free and vegetarian diet, but this place deserves a review for standing out! Researching the menu online beforehand paid off. While we waited our very friendly waiter brought me gluten free flatbread and the pizza was great with mushroom and truffle. They have a separate GF menu so be sure to ask for as you are being seated.I was surprised to see it so busy on a tuesday so if you have a bigger group I would recommend reserving a table. The atmosphere was relaxed and inviting but had great service. Will probably be back, but not too often due to the price.",

I ordered the chicken parmesan and it was a good size (too big really) that came with two chicken breasts and a side of pasta.I can't really speak too much of the interior because for some reason we got seated in a semi-private room away from the main dining room.  There was one other large party in our room and they were quite noisy so I sort of felt like we were crashing in on their private area.  It was weird and I'm not sure why we were seated in there.

Our waiter kept the breadsticks and salad coming. Multiple orders of soup were taken. Love the extra cheese on top of anything you want. Great price- got all that food for around $60 plus tip. Our waiter was very attentive and made us laugh a few times. Even wished my dad a happy birthday because he overheard us mentioning it being his birthday lunch.Neutral: Rosemary chicken was OK. Chicken gnocchi soup could have been a bit spicier. Minestrone was OK.Take home: Kinda wish I had tipped my server more (I did a bit over 20%). He was wonderful.",

The food here is wonderful - I always start by sharing the smoked mozzarella fonduta before moving on to the always flavorful minestrone soup. Whatever you order for your entree, make sure you save room for dessert - the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake is to die for!But more than the food and environment, the customer service here is what makes this Olive Garden unmatched. I have never been greeted by a more cheerful and enthusiastic wait staff; they genuinely enjoy working there and making pleasant conversation with the diners. I always tip my servers well, because they really do make us feel like part of the family!",

After sitting there for ten minutes we were led to a dinig area that was maybe 1/3 full of customers. I was a bit confused on their use of host and hostesess. There was one person taking names, another checking the names, two other standing their alternating taking the diners to their seats in the dated dining room. Christ the only reason we went to this place is because we had a gift card and I'm hoping the gift giver next year makes a better choice. So my wife ordered the fettucini alfredo with Chicken (she has a standard) and I ordered some sort of entre that appeals to men that only eat beef, toss it with some pasta and voila, Dinner!  The humorous moment was when the server asked me how I would like my braised beef done-it's braised, look it up. Anyhow the sauce with it was a cream base, had some portabella mushrooms with it and some fresh parsley (to make it appear fresh) though my entre looked like it has been sitting under the hot lights for a good 10 minutes. The salad we got was marginal (I don't get what the big deal is) and the breadsticks seemed like they'd been sitting in the basket for 10 minutes (not so hot)- While our food  wasn't absolutely horrible, I don't understand why this place is full all the time. I would love for it to be another 10 years (or more) until I eat here again....glad I wasn't paying for it!",

The complimentary and delicious bread sticks and salad always came out to our table within 5 minutes, and let's not forget these are endless!  Drinks and food came really quick, surprisingly quick actually considering the huge crowd waiting outside.  Our servers have always been attentive and friendly.Food is priced very expensive, but I think one knows that before they come here.  If you don't... well then you're in for a surprise.  Everything I've ever ordered though has been delicious and a big enough portion that I have enough for two big meals.  I don't go here all the time because of the price,  but when I do, the experience has always been great.  Let's not forget that every time I went they were offering complimentary wine, pouring us full glasses of it.  If you don't mind the wait to get seated, I definitely recommend this restaurant.",

We waited ten minutes for two glasses of sangria, when that finally arrived the waiter took our order (some couples combo that included an appetizer). The the size of my drink was quite small so I finished it rather quickly and waited for our server to have another ten minute personal conversation with the table next to ours meanwhile we were still waiting for our breadsticks and salad... After about ten more minutes the waiter showed up with the breadsticks and salad. At that very same time our main entree came out. We sent it back since we had not had our salad or even our appetizers yet. I then ordered another drink. Ten minutes go by while we gnawed on old cold breadsticks and soggy salad still waiting on my drink and our appetizers while intently listening to our waiter recall his hometown antics with the table next to us. Finally the drink and appetizers arrive after about five more minutes, shouldn't have waited for it though The ravioli was cold and chewy, I mean cowhide chewy... Then our main course comes back out. Back out as in from the heat lamp. One bite in we realized the cheese had separated and it was barely warm. Needless to say after a small chat with the manager explaining how I would not return due to poor food and even worse service we left without being charged. In the end, save your time, save your money, and do not eat here, there are much better establishments in champaign.",

While waiting for dinner, we had the unlimited breadsticks which were good along with the soup. Somehow my two bowls of soup came out lukewarm which was quite disappointing. The dinner that I had ordered had overcooked fettuccine alfredo with 4 piece of \"steak medallion\". Unfortunately, not a good cut of beef as they were tough and chewy. Even though I had ordered it medium rare, the steak was close to medium to well. Even before we finished eating the waiter asked if we would like dessert and promptly threw down the check when we said no. Overall I will have to pass from eating here again.Pro: unlimited soup/breadsticks or salad if you wantCons: overcooked pasta, the quality of the meat for the dish was not goodHidden gem:Check sunday paper for coupons. Unlimited soup and breadstick. Sign up online for the e-club for a free appetizer with the purchase of 2 entrees.",

The Champaign Olive Garden has declined significantly within the last year.  I believe this is due to a change in management, but I am not 100% certain.  My last meal there was in November and the standards were that of poorly-run fastfood restaurant.  This is what I wrote about it at the time:\"Remember how Olive Garden used to be a 'nice' place to have a casual meal?  Even though it was a chain restaurant and you knew most of the food was heated up in a microwave, it looked like real food and it almost tasted like it had been cooked.  It seemed a little nicer than your T.G.I. Fridays and your Applebee's.  Well, it's not like that anymore.  Not the one in C-U anyway.  I don't think I will be going back there ever again.   The first thing I noticed when I walked in was that the entire place reeked like a sour towel.  Someone had obviously wiped all of the tables down with a cheap disinfectant solution that had gotten a bit... ripe.  It was disgusting.  I proceeded to the bathroom to wash my hands before my meal where I found two employees lounging about and chatting while pretending to clean the restroom.  Since they did not find it prudent to tone down their conversation whilst a guest was in their presence, I got to enjoy a pre-dinner melodrama.  Apparently an employee of the Olive Garden is trying to file a sexual harassment suit and the management had been asking both ladies if they had experienced any inappropriate behavior.  And while the accused sometimes gets a \"wild hair up their ass\" they did not consider themselves harassed.  Speaking of sex, Manuel looked FINE this morning and when he came into work they were like \"oh my GOD!\"  When I got back to my seat, our waiter (who I admit was nice and attentive) served us a sample of white zinfandel that had the distinct vinegary taste of a wine that has been left uncorked for too long.  The food, which tasted decent, no longer looks, tastes or feels like real food.  Both the dinner and dessert had an artificiality to it that resembled an expensive TV dinner.  The textures were waxy and the cheese was lardlike.  While the flavors were bold, they tasted man-made and had a processed mouth-feel.  It was to real food what Velveeta is to real cheese.  The dessert, the chocolate torte, especially had the look of something that had just been plopped out of it's microwavable container.   The vanilla sauce was practically flavorless and the torte was only heated halfway, resulting in a jello-pudding like consistency to the fudge filling.  It is also made with artificial sugar now, which adds to its alien flavor and texture.  In truth, the food quality is comparable to a fast food restaurant.  The only difference is that they offer more variety and a few more low quality ingredients per dish.I know it's just Olive Garden.  I know it's an evil chain restaurant and a glorified McDonalds.  I guess the thing is that it didn't used to be this way.  I think I've heard that they are under new management.  It used to be satisfying in a guilty pleasure flavor overload sort of way and it made you feel sort of ok about it because it deceived you into thinking it was real food.  But now it's not.  The seams are showing.  Quality of service and presentation has gone way down.  Corners are being cut and it shows.  You can tell it is just a fancier Fazoli's and it's really had to pay $25-$30 bucks a person for some sour wine and some microwaved Italian Velveeta in a place that smells like mildew.",

We waited about 15 mins just to order lemonade. By the time Meghan took our drink order, we were ready to order our appetizer. Good thing because it took 45 minutes for our smoked mozzarella to come to our table. The other guests seated around us all seemed to have better service and didnt have much of a wait. Our server ignored our requests for refills and more bread sticks and had to be reminded a couple times. Our cups sat empty for most of our meal. Not even 5 minutes after our appetizer (almost and hour into our meal), we got our entrees. We didn't have enough time for our app. I have zero complaints about our food, just the service was awful. At the end of our meal, Meghan boxed up our left overs and said she would return with a bad for our bread sticks, but she never came back.  The only thing crappier than the service was the parking lot with potholes that could swallow my Hyundai whole. We will be going back to Olive Garden, but not to this location.",

WEEEEEE!I swear, the soup/salad/breadsticks have sprinkles of crack and MSG, they're pretty addicting.  And I'm pretty sure they use one can of Morton's salt per serving bowl of salad.Tip: Make sure you ask for more salad and breadsticks as soon as you get your first batch, or the waiter will disappear until your entrees arrive.  By then, they know they got you pinned against a psychological wall, because who eats more salad with their entree?  Break past that wall of uncomfortability and continue to ask for refills until the check arrives.  Heck, ask for it after the check arrives.  It's like a glass of water - it should always be full.FYI, the sangria is f-ing expensive.

This one wasn't my choice though, and knowing how I feel about chains as well as my high standards for Italian cuisine, I bit my tongue and hoped for the best.We had to wait about 10 minutes on a Tuesday night to be seated. Apparently Olive Garden is a hot commodity in Champaign....We were seated and I was quite indecisive about what to get. I settled on a build-your-own-pasta with alfredo/cream sauce and added Italian sausage. For my choice of soup, I got the Tuscan bean, and of course the notorious breadsticks. The soup was pretty tasty, it had like beans and zucchini and onions and a bunch of other things in a tasty tomato-y broth. Not bad! The pasta I got wasn't too bad either, the noodles may have been a little overcooked but the sauce was pretty creamy. I did not like the sausage. I'm no tubular meat expert but this tasted really institutional and for the upcharge it cost to add it to my pasta, I probably should have just went meatless or ordered the chicken, like my smarter date did....The thing that really upset me about the experience though was the service. I don't remember the server's name, he was actually quite personable, but our meal felt very very rushed. Our soups came out quick which was good, but I was not even halfway done with mine before our dinners had arrived and we had to move our soups out of the way to eat our dinner. I'd consider myself a fast eater, too so this was frustrating, especially since I wanted to actually talk to my date, you know, the reason why I'm here in the first place!! This wasn't the last straw though, I was probably 75% done with my entre when the server comes up and asks if we are interested in desert. Ugh! We looked at each other and both agreed this meal was unnecessarily rushed. At that point I just asked for the bill which he pulled up on those tacky tablet things a lot of chain restaurants have now.The food wasn't even as bad as I thought it was going to be, but the hurriedness of the service really put me off. 2/5",

Salad did have pepperoncini peppers, which were a nice touch. The waitress was polite but seemed to be either new or overwhelmed. She never refilled any of our drinks and just seemed sort of distracted. We left her a nice tip though.  I've been a waitress and know how hard it can be, especially at a chain restaurant where the crowds and their demands are never-ending.  I'm no food snob, but Olive Garden seems to aspire to lowest-common-denominator, faux-Italian food for people who've never had the real thing and don't know what they're missing.",

It's fine for a date, business dinner, something of that sorts, but definitely not the kind of place I'd keep coming back to.",

The starter fig pizza with prosciutto was crisp and tasty. We ended up sampling each other's dishes including the seafood risotto and fresh pastas. The most outstanding was a real gnocchi, light and fluffy paired with a scrumptious lamb Raghu that melted on the tongue. For dessert, creamy cappuccinos and a steamed bread pudding worth dreaming about. Beyond that the staff was gracious and warm. A perfect lunch. Thanks Timpones!",

I would say that the food is overpriced, but it's hard to get \"nice\" food directly on campus, so you pay a premium for convenience I guess. I've been here a good number of times over the years, and every time was an enjoyable trip, except once. I took someone here on a date, and we were seated in an area where the lights weren't working and the speakers were broken. I'm guessing they figured they could just put students there and get away with it. I complained (the restaurant wasn't near full and I had placed a reservation), they were nice about it and moved us and the rest of the dinner went very well. The decor leaves something to be desired, but otherwise a solid restaurant, with decent service and good food.",

The food was fantastic but portions were on the small side, especially considering the prices.  The peach bread pudding was scrumptious.  I probably won't be back, not because it wasn't good, but because there are a lot of other upscale places in town I'd like to try before I break the bank at Timpone's again, and special occasions that warrant a $100 tab only come along so often.",

Well, I ordered the papardelle with the bolognese. Being a bolognese snob (and believing very sincerely that the best bolognese I've had was made by yours truly), I have to say it was certainly up to my standards. In addition, I had a slice of my neighbor's margherita pizza which was also tasty. I've not been to any other Italian restaurants in town, but this is Chicago-quality stuff right here. While it's a little on the expensive side, it is finer dining. It's not somewhere I'd expect to go every day for lunch but it would be nice for special occasions, dates, etc.",

                "review": "This place has been here for a long time but I think it's still trying to figure some things out  The menu is very ambitious for a campustown location, serving up \"campustown\" pizza along side upscale American/French/Italian fare.  The dining room is upstairs and is nice enough in a traditional way, but the look and ambience are very dated.  The quality of service is not in line with the menu.  Our server was clearly overwhelmed.  Our table had white linens bespeaking of a \"nice\" restaurant but was set improperly.  Wrong silverware, no bread plates.  We sat for quite some time before our drink order was taken, then our waiter left in the middle of taking the drink order to serve food to another table.  He eventually returned to take our drink order and then asked us for our entire food order at the same time.  Bread service was slow though the bread was good.  The glass of riesling we ordered was clearly from a bottle that had been left open for too long.  Another glass from a fresh bottle arrived after a while.We ordered some salads to start off the meal.  The bistro salad looked great - field greens, asparagus, potato, poached egg, bacon, vinaigrette.  However, when the salad arrived, there was no bacon.  Ahem.  \"Excuse me, but our salads have no bacon.\"  Response: \"OMG, forgot the bacon.\"  Instead of taking our salads away and giving us new ones, we were given small bowls of bacon pieces to put on the salads ourselves.  Please.We ordered a wild mushroom pizza with sausage and gorgonzola but we wanted to substitute goat cheese for the gorgonzola.  We were told this was not possible.  Restaurant policy is no substitutions, just subtractions.  We could remove the g-z but could not add goat cheese.  We ended up using the build your own pizza option and built the pizza we wanted.  What a pain in the a**!  The pizza was delicious though.  The thin crust must be one of the best I've ever had.The entrees were generally very good.  The American \"kobe\" skirt steak was tasty, having a sweet marinade reminiscent of Korean kalbi in flavor.  The duck breast was well prepared.  The trout was overcooked but was still edible.The desserts were adequate and there is a good selection of after dinner drinks and dessert wines.In summary, Timpone's has an identity crisis.  If they want to serve this type of food, then there is a level of service that is expected to go along with it which they did not meet.  It's hard to enjoy any restaurant when you are unhappy with the service.  My recommendation is to go for the pizza - then you won't need a bread plate.",

So I end up here periodically to entertain faculty who are visiting the U of I from elsewhere.   It's decent enough upscalish Italian-American food, but location is the only reason I go there --- places like Radio Maria, Cafe Luna, or Milo's have quite a bit better food.  Overall the place gives the impression of a reasonably-nice hotel dinning room with mediocre food to match (though, in contrast to that image, prices are reasonable).",

My boyfriend and I went here for a nice post-valentine's day weekend dinner (we knew it wouldn't be too busy this weekend, so we opted to do our v-day dinner this weekend instead.) When we walked in, the door and sign were very old-looking, but in a charming way, so that was promising.The first floor is a little more laid-back, but they say you can go to the upper floor if we'd like, so we opted for that. It was very nicely decorated with sculptures, paintings, and plants. The other diners were dressed casually, but still nice, if that makes sense. Like, jeans with a button-up or nice sweater. It was quite nice up there and the service was lovely. I ordered the veal and it was absolutely delicious, and the perfect portion size; however, it was not the perfect portion size for the price. For a $29 entree, I expected a little more on the plate, or for the price to be lower for the same amount. None the less, the food was delicious and so was my boyfriend's. We ended up sharing the crme brle for dessert and it was very good.Overall, the staff was very attentive and helpful. Although the atmosphere was slightly intimidating, it still had a nice, cozy, fancy-restaurant feel, and I wouldn't mind going again.TLDR: It's a nice place with good food and service, but expect to shell out some dough.",

                "review": "My boyfriend and I came in last night for the Local Flavors event. Sadly, we were a little underwhelmed. Local ingredients are very exciting to me and we've never been to Timpone's. I hear a lot of mixed reviews, everything from \"I had food poisoning\" to \"It's my favorite place when I have a special occasion\". Needless to say, we were excited to give it a try. When you walk in, you must go upstairs to be seated. After being seated, we enjoyed the Italian themed \"high art\" that was so popular in the 80s while we chowed down on a tasty meatball appetizer. We debated the ethics of charging the measly $1 for the bread starter. It was our locally inspired entrees that were especially disappointing. After a long decision making process, I went with the $25 halibut. It came with gnocchi and assorted vegetables. As I ate it, I felt like the fish was a little dry and overcooked and I noticed hints of freezer burn - yuck. After tasting all the components of the dish separately, I couldn't figure out what the culprit was. All I know is, it would hit me every now and again. My boyfriend's dish was the poussin (a baby chicken). It was super tender and was served with a farro pilaf. While it was tasty, the sweet sauce they smothered the chicken in made you feel like you were eating General Tso's chicken. We decided to try the apple crisp for dessert which was amazing! Little cranberries help balance out the sweetness. They did that annoying thing where they garnish it with mint even though there's no mint in the dish.In the end, I'm thinking maybe it was a mistake that we ordered off the special menu. Perhaps their typical Italian American cuisine would be better. From what we experienced, we definitely felt that the dishes were overpriced for the quality. We spent $100, and left feeling like it just wasn't meeting the quality we've seen at other places nearby. For $100, you could have a perfect meal in downtown Champaign. For $50, you can go next door and have a pretty awesome meal too! I'd like to come back and try the regular menu but, I'm not in a hurry to come back and spend the kind of money they're asking for mediocre food.",

Conversely, the waiter was not very helpful when it came to ordering wine.  He made no attempt to help suggesting anything, he may not have known the wine list?  They have an extensive wine list, which should have a knowledgeable staff.  Our waiter was no student, he just didn't care.  Also, he rushed us to put in our dinner order, and the food came too quickly.  The place was not busy, don't know why this happened.  Perhaps it was because I was a female.  Often, we get treated differently when dining without a male.",

The biggest plus for me, aside from the food that is, was the waitstaff. All of the servers were very friendly and professional, and I could tell they all looked out for each other. Case in point, I noticed some lint on one of my glasses of wine, and before I could even say anything, one of the other waiters saw me studying the glass and quickly came over and offered to replace it.Speaking of wine, the selection was great, but I was unfortunately relegated to the limited \"wine by the glass\" menu since I was the only red wine drinker at my table. Even so, the selection of wine by the glass was well-rounded and pretty solid, and our waiter's wine recommendations were spot on. Now, for the food!Bread and olive oil is complimentary, of course, and very tasty (so simple...but so good!). For starters, we ordered the crab cakes as well as a spring salad with walnuts and gorgonzola, both of which were very good. For my entree, I had the roast duck, which came with fingerling potatoes, red cabbage, spring vegetables. The entire dish was fantastic. Moist duck, perfectly cooked vegetables, and a wonderful sauce that had blueberries in it. A simple dish done very, very well.In all, Timpone's is a great place for a gourmet meal at a pretty decent price. They have a nice selection of veg-friendly dishes, too (not vegan, however). I can't recommend this place enough. Give it a try!",

We witnessed multiple tables of college aged valentine's dates (and some older folks too) sharing one dinner or actually walking out before ordering because they couldn't afford it.  Our waiter was HORRIBLE.  He had an incredibly loud voice and though friendly enough, was not really \"nice restaurant\" material. For example: instead of \"may I offer you more coffee sir?\" he said, \"do you want more coffee?\" (in that really loud obnoxious voice--think yelling)....  I mean, I am not snooty but it's Valentines and we are trying to be romantic on a night out so a little politeness could go a long way.  I could hear his voice across the dining room.  He actually called out one of the couples who left before ordering---saying \"Sorry Guys! You know the menu is really good and if you were in Chicago, you would pay $150, etc.\" I mean, he kind of went on and on....really loudly...and you know these broke college kids were just trying to sneak out of there with the least amount of embarrassment.  Geesh! HE was horrible.  Did I say that already? and we had to ask for everything- bread, refills, etc. nothing was anticipated---he was just bad.  The price is steep- especially for Champaign- but it was a holiday so the splurge can pretty much be justified.  Portion sizes were very big and good.  Food was hot and perfectly cooked.  They didn't accommodate vegetarians well- as we overheard at the table next to us----the veg options included the Chilean Sea bass without the Chilean Sea bass---so just basically the sides (what? Like, have a pasta dish, it is an italian joint after all). We had a decent date---would have been great if the waitstaff were better.  Would probably go back.  I think they should consider some new staff though.  :)",

I actually have a paycheck that isn't from wiping tables or undergraduate research!The times I've been to Timpone's has always been impressive.  My most recent visit, however, made me appreciate this place all the more.  I can't say that I've had a better pasta with bolognese sauce.  Sure, it's a seemingly absurdly simple dish, but everything about the thing was just right.The wife got a fried oyster and spinach salad that was extremely delicious as well.  I kept meaning to ask what sort of oysters they were, because you don't typically see consistently small oysters like that.  Alas, the mother-in-law has since moved away from the Champaign/Urbana area so our visits will be fewer and farther in between.

The white wine I had was also very good. I was too full for dessert but wanted to try the lemon tart so I ordered it to go. I figured I could have it later while I worked in my hotel room. I was surprised when I got my bill and saw that I was charged .50 for the container b/c I asked for the tart to go. It's not a big deal but after paying over 60.00 for my meal (for one), this left a negative impression. I've gotten dessert to go at other restaurants of all different price ranges and have never been charged for a container. I wonder if I had eaten part of the tart at the restaurant and then asked for the rest to go if they would have still charged me the .50. Again, not a big deal but this changed my impression of Timpone's from being an upscale restaurant to a fine restaurant wanna-be.",

The restaurant was filled with retirement-age couples/parties about to head to a Krannert performance on the Wednesday evening that we went. This past week, we went to Timpone's to celebrate my birthday. We started off sharing the \"Fritto Misto\" appetizr, described as \"Calamari, Gulf Shrimp, Scallops, Red Onion, and Zucchini.\" When the dish arrived, it was nothing but a pile of glorified onion rings. There were only three pieces of calamari (small tentacles), 3 shrimp (which were small, and clearly of the phosphate-pumped Asian variety, and a scattered few wet calico scallops...95% of the \"Fritto Misto\" was red onion. I feel as though by listing the seafood first, that indicates that the bulk will be seafood, or at the very least, there will be an even distribution of the components. Not wanting to be a \"difficult customer\", I chalked it up to just a \"bad batch.\" That being said, the recipe was a straight copy of Judy Rodgers' dish in the Zuni Cafe (San Francisco) cookbook, and I could have made it at home...However, when I received my entree, \"Sea Scallops with a Dijon Beurre Blanc on a bed of celery root puree\"... I was furious. There were 5 scallops, each approximately the size of a quarter (no exaggeration) and only seared on one side. The mound of puree could not have been more than 1/2 cup (and didn't even taste good). My husband ordered \"Chianti-Braised Shortribs with Homemade Gnocchi\" - which came with fewer than 10 small gnocchi. Worst of all, the food tasted bad; the beurre blanc was so sweet it was like Creme Anglaise with Dijon and I could have done a better braise at home easily.  I know that times are tough, and that food costs are supposed to be ~30% of the final restaurant price- but I felt completely gouged. I'm happy to pay for a delicious meal and I do not expect large portions. I travel pretty frequently to Chicago and DC- I know what good food costs and what \"normal\" portion sizes are at \"fine dining\" restaurants. I did not want to make a scene because I didn't want my husband to feel bad for picking the restaurant. The only reason this place could possibly stay in business is because of its proximity to campus/the Krannert Center for Performing Arts or because most people have very low expectations due to the lack of \"Fine Dining\" in the C-U area.Our server was very attentive and great, but the food was so bad (even with the small portions, we didn't finish our food and didn't want to take the leftovers home!). We will not be returning.",

I have eaten here many times b/c it is close to areas of the University in which I work.  At one point this was a bit of the \"make the scene\" place, and it is convenient for pre- or post-concert dining at Krannert.  Nevertheless, many other places have come along since this one, and while I would say it's in the top handful of places in town, it is no longer at the top.

The food is Italian, which is your normal Italian. The atmosphere is great-cozy and romantic at times.  Everything is made fresh and tastes awesome! We got introduced to the owner and the Chef which made it even more enjoyable!",

Portions are small, especially for an Italian place, which makes it a better \"date\" place - you don't have to worry about getting bloated.  You will even have room left to gourmandize one of their great desserts with your date.",

On one occasion we made reservations, and while being seated the hostess tried to place us at a table. We prefer a booth and asked to be seated at one but she refused saying that they were not yet seating in that area. We insisted, and this went back and forth several times before we said that we will leave. She finally allowed us to sit at a booth but then made a dramatic show about placing us there before stomping off. It was bizarre and not the typical experience, but just a cautionary sign of what comes when staffing students.",

No thank you!So, for a good time, there, Timpone's was the one.  The answer to everything.And, in that, there was value.  Not a dollar value, I'm afraid, as Timpone's sure charged for the pleasure.  And there wasn't much flexibility there, either... I mean, it's not like you could order and they'd deliver.  But you could pick-up, so that was something.My favorite, by a landslide, was their Italian Beef, but it, too, wasn't that dependable.  It really just hinged upon whether you liked thickly sliced garlic.  You could always tell when they got down to the bottom.... besides the beef getting a little fattier, there were so many pieces of sliced garlic, the whole texture/taste changed.  Enough garlic to keep ten Dracula's at bay, I assure you!Their expensive sub-par pizza was soon replaced by Ozark.  A happy day for all those on the South Campus.Honestly, we had to depend on this place for so many years, and I just always found their food \"meh\", and their \"service\" even worse.  Unfortunately, their prices were the biggest insult... When the new place was built across the street, we were all glad.If you're looking for a very dated restaurant, with a menu that's reflective of its age, give this one a try.  Just limit your expectations.",

So close!I tried a tomato bisque with goat cheese lumps in it that had a lot of potential but there were so many goat cheese lumps that the balance was all wrong.  When you order a tomato bisque it should taste like tomato, I reckon.  Almost!I had a fancy-pants mushroom and sausage pizza.  Each ingredient seemed good by itself, but as a whole it had a taste I would describe as \"many strong clashing cheeses.\"  Nearly there!",

Dessert, pizza, pasta, buffalo chicken salad, I could pretty much name everything on the menu and not have one bad thing to say. Love the ambiance here too - especially the upstairs! Great for pick-up or even a nice dinner when you don't want to spring for a more formal sit-down place.",

I came here for the first time yeeears ago on my violin teacher's recommendation (she is a  U of I graduate and had many fond memories of the place). I have been here several times since; I always try to stop by when I'm in the neighborhood. Za's has an excellent location near campus and a lot of other restaurants, apparel shops, ice cream/froyo places, etc. Eating here can be a bit overwhelming at first because there are SO many options! You fill out a sheet of paper to describe exactly what you want with options from salads, paninis, soups, pizzas, smoothies, and more. The big selling point of Za's is that you can customize your order to exactly how you want it with any toppings, sauces, or flavors--any way you want it! After ordering, you scoot on over to the pick-up counter and wait for your food to be ready. There are tables both upstairs and downstairs, so don't fret if every table is taken on the first floor. The stairs are kind of steep, so be careful as you walk up there with your food! I usually order the \"pick two\" option. My favorite is the broccoli cheddar soup with the \"lite panini,\" which can be customized exactly how you want it. The broccoli cheddar here is one of my favorites and has grated cheddar cheese on top. Yum. The food is by no means mind-blowing. Overall, this is your standard Italian lunch food with a few very above average options, like the soup. I also highly recommend trying the smoothies here (my drink of choice is the mango). They use real fruit and fruit juice!Honestly, if you're in the area, you really can't miss a stop at Za's. Note: I last ate here before it burned down, so I can't speak to the quality of the original's replacement.",

Mia Za's is located in a cozy little row of businesses in the heart of Campus Town conveniently adjacent to the University of illinois' main Quad.  Parking can be a bit difficult, but there are usually spaces available a block or two from the location, bring money as Parking Enforcement is serious business in and around Campus.Depending on the time of day you may be hard-pressed to find ample seating for you and your dining companion as this place is very popular with the student population. If there isn't enough room on the main floor you can head upstairs to find more tables, and a warm atmosphere with a very beautiful copper ceiling, and Italian inspired artwork on the walls.Their menu is full of incredibly tasty and healthy ingredients, and everything is cooked to order. It'll probably take longer for you to decide on what to order with the custom Pizza, Pasta, Panini, and Salad options. But never fear for those you that are indecisive; Mia Za's offers more traditional favorites as well.Prices vary on what kind of sauce or items you get, and if you get extra items. With that said you can get a \"Pick 2\" where you get half an order of pasta, salad, or panini served with another half order of salad, soup, or panini for just shy of 7 dollars (without drink).",

Now that I am back I have found out that there are multiple locations which works out well. The prices are actually cheaper than when I was here for college due to a modification in the menu. For the pasta you get to select from multiple types and sauces with 4 toppings for 5 dollars. The premium protein items i.e shrimp, meatballs, chicken will run you a dollar more each. The food is prepared quickly, however I don't know if they changed it now to use a convection oven/microwave to nuke your toppings which is one down side. This is then added to a pan with the sauce and served quickly. You also get a nice piece of garlic bread. All and all this is better than McD and for the same price. There are also other options such as pizza, salads, sandwiches etc. I have never strayed from the pastaPro: inexpensive, quick, large portionsCons: microwaved toppings (i guess you get what you pay for)Hidden gem:Sign up for the perka app. You need to check in and tell the cashier so they can give you the punch to earn free food. I did not realize this and ended up not getting my first check-in. You can't just check-in which makes sense or people would abuse the system",

Mind you, that customer disappeared for a while before he came back to return the food.  How do I know if the food was tempered with or not.  Why do I even need to take that risk.  I am a paying customer and only want to take food prepared for me, not for \"Becca\".  And through this whole process nobody apologized for the order error or offered to make my order fresh.  I had to demand an apology and a refund.  AND it didn't come easy.  Every single one of the employees there gave me an attitude, even the owner tried to lecture me on how busy they are.  It's like they don't even have customer service.   And my order (a large salad plus chicken plus a side of soup) wasn't cheap.  I should have just gone to Panera across the street.

I came one night during a slow dinner with my bf and it was practically empty. After filling out the forms, we went to wait. Half an hour passed by and three other people who came after me got their food. Another guy took a pizza I thought was mine, but the kitchen guy shrugged and insisted it wasn't. My bf got his pizza after fifteen minutes and began to eat without me while I sat around waiting. I kept asking the kitchen staff who said to be patient and wait even though I was already waiting for half an hour. After finishing my milkshake, I was clearly annoyed and not hungry anymore. I considered demanding a refund when the manager? came up to me and asked me what I was waiting for. I told him a pizza and he went to look for it. He returned and told me they LOST my form somehow in a sea of four sheets of paper. I had to fill out another one and wait even longer. When my pizza came, I decided to eat it but it wasn't even that appetizing. The crust was thin and floppy and it looked like they haphazardly threw on the toppings.  Personally, I'm disappointed with Mia Za.",

The price is great, too.Pretty much everything else on the menu---whether you customize it or not---will also be well prepared, well presented, and well received by your taste buds. Back in sophomore year of high school I had lunch here almost daily, and the only bad experience I can remember involved an unbearably spicy sauce that even my high-spice-tolerating Chinese friends agreed was over the top. (The chef may have just screwed up my particular order that day, but just to be safe, I'd stay away from any spicy option.)On a final note, I've always been surprised at how quickly my order is ready, regardless of how crowded the restaurant is.",

That's an entire meal for $5 and tax. Portions are always large (I usually pick 2: salad and pasta).There is plenty of seating (just head upstairs if you don't like sitting close to people or have more than a party of 2). I love the plastic cups that you can take and bring back for cheeper drinks (think Starbucks or Duckin' Donuts without the expensive coffee) and the service is always friendly. Ordering can be a little confusing the first time (which sheet is for the pasta!?) but someone is happy to help you out and ask all the important questions (artichokes? do you like olives? do you want pasta? do you like cheese?). Overall, this places is fairly inexpensive, friendly, clean, and it's always open, even in those strange summer months when no one is around.",

This new Za's is putting ingredients on pasta, microwaving it, then pouring sauce and spices on after. I don't know who thought of this cooking process but it wasn't someone who knows how to cook.

I definitely found the ordering papers overwhelming the first time I visited a Za's, but I didn't have to wait on my co-worker, who picked out a delicious meal pretty quick.  While we were waiting in line, there was a guy standing next to it checking papers and passing out cups to make sure they were clear before we got to the checkout.  This proved to be genius, because we were through the line in about five minutes.  In another 5-10, we had our food.  And it was good.  My only complaints were that my rotini wasn't exactly al dente and there were lots of onions and garlic in everything (but this is only bad for me personally).The prices vary, but if you get a lunch-sized serving and a drink, you can get out for $7-10.  If it's a little bigger, or you decide you want a slice of their delicious tiramisu, it's gonna be more like $12-15.Quick, (seemingly) fresh, 'licious.",

While looking at the bill of fare at this establishment, the owner came out and gave us a sales pitch for having our dinner there.This is a very small \"hole in the wall\" place that probably seats no more than 20 diners.  Tables are on the first floor and also on a second floor.The gimmick here is that you are provided with a ballot-like menu to order your food.  We both decided to order a pasta meal.  So, we filled out a paper form that allows you to select the type of noodles, sauce, toppings, and other items you want to eat.  Then you hand the form to the counter attendant, and they call you when your meal is ready: usually in less than ten minutes.The same procedure is used to choose salads, paninis, and pizza.We were there at about 5:45 on a Monday during the summer session, so the place was not busy.

But it's good food and cheap Italian if you need a fix. I'm fond of the thin-crust pizza, and I normally get half with a spinach salad. But the menu is so diverse as to be overwhelming. Come prepared to fill out a scantron of deliciousness; it's totally worth it every once in a while, but the vast array of options slow the place down to no end.",

Normally stay away from margherita pizzas because they can be very bland. This one was not it was bursting with flavor! It was so good. Writing this review makes me want another one.

The server could barely hide her snarl when I asked a question, but that's because they were serving about 3,000 people at once.  Honestly, it felt like Henry Ford was making a Model T-ortelini.I do like that you can customize salads and sandwiches and pasta--and that lemon cream sauce is DELICIOUS.However, it has all the personality of a computer science grad student, and the old-style Italian movie poster lend very little charm.Yet I know I'm going to be hungry at some point in the middle of the day and forget to bring my lunch.And then Henry Ford's Italian Motor Cafe will be there for me.",

It was wet in the middle and pretty unencumbered by flavor.I tried a smoothie once.  It was aiight.  Never been compelled to try another.I tried a salad once.  It was pretty boring, and it made me miss Pluto's back in Palo Alto.But the tomato basil soup, I love.  It's divine with its small sprinkling of grated parmesan (?) cheese that melts only halfway even though you stir it.  One thing I don't appreciate is the impatient guy who calls out my name.  He was pretty obnoxious this one time when I didn't respond on the first call.  But rudeness and some small confusion about not having a form to just order soup won't keep me away from good soup on Green Street.Under 4 bucks for a bowl of soup that comes with a small piece of french bread is good eatz.  And fast, too.",

The pizza and pasta are ok though.I am still giving it 3 stars because they have a good selection of iced tea and the extraordinarily eclectic ambiance. There is wall art of unique silhouettes like a cat dangling from a power line and a ninja on a bike upstairs which are modestly entertaining. But there is also a great little function where you can text in a song request and a monitor will play the song and video.My choice?Birthday Song - 2 Chainz ft. Kanye West.3 stars.",

Went here last night before the dinner rush at around 4 pm. It's one of those places where they give you a sheet of paper with predetermined options on it OR the option to create your own pizza, pasta, salad, or sandwich. Most of the people working the counter are just college students and therefore not necessarily skilled in helping you create awesome meals. After staring at the overwhelming menu for a little while I ended up creating my own pizza. I had garlic marinara sauce with a feta/mozzarella mix topped with red onions, olives, and sun dried tomatoes. It was kick-ass! I ate (most) of the whole thing. I did give away some of it because it was too good not to share. I had been to this place a few years ago (before it burnt down and was rebuilt) and I remember having something delicious then, too! I believe I created a pasta that time.I really had minimal interaction with staff, but everyone seemed pleasant when I did need them to place the order. They don't really \"wait\" on you because it's seat yourself, leave your dishes at the table. Really all you're doing is ordering at a counter; kind of like a more fancy, involved, delicious subway concept.",

Seriously, where else would you go?  I've been a fan for years.I have always loved their pastas the best, and they've really expanded the options. Last time I went, I got multigrain rotini with pesto and veggies.  It felt really healthy and light, even though it was a sizable portion.  The huge and delicious piece of garlic bread did kind of counteract the \"light\" feeling, however...  I also had one of their delicious smoothies, and I have never gone wrong by ordering any of their infinite combos.  Anything with mango in it is an automatic favorite of mine!Yeah, it's not gourmet, but for an inexpensive lunch that isn't fast food or a chain place, it's definitely the best you can get in Champaign.

We kept telling them about this issue and all the time they said : yeah you are right, and kept doing the same thing! Today we went there for lunch and we saw the same thing, cashier preparing food with bare dirty hands. When my friend wanted to order, he told the cashier and she just went and took the pizza bread with her hands in front of us! We tried to be calm and waited for our food. And guess what we got! My friend got his pizza with the smallest amount of cheese and toppings in the world! The whole thing was just a big bread! He got angry and asked the staff where their boss is. The old guy there said she is out of town and will be back on Wednesday. Well! And he did not accept that the staff use their bare hands to prepare food and showed us tongs and said they always use this! Well, we have never seen them use the tongs!

Za's definitely fit the bill. I got a heaping portion of spaghetti with tomato-cream sauce (my one weakness), fresh garlic, basil, and sun-dried tomatoes. It came with a big piece of garlic bread and I paid like 80 extra for some extra parmesan and sauce (for dipping my bread) but even then my dinner was under $10. We took our dinners to go, so of course it needed a little re-heating once we got home (I like my food to be burn-your-mouth hot) but it was delicious and extremely filling!My only complaints would be that they were a little stingy on the toppings and the inside of the restaurant smelled a little bit like burnt cheese. The service was fine- typical counter service in a college town. I don't really care that they weren't super nice or engaging, since I was ordering to-go and the restaurant runs a fast-food type system. Order on one side, pick up on the other.  I wouldn't dock stars for disinterested employees at a McDonald's, so I won't do it here. I will TOTALLY be back. I already miss that sauce!",

In fact, I basically disagree with this nation's view on portion size completely...but that's another subject for another time.This place offers something unique in that you get to choose what style of meal you want.  When you walk in there are 4 separate menus: Pizza, Panini, Salad & Pasta.  They also have a Soup and Kids menu.  To these you can also add whatever your little heart desires like garlic bread, soup, toppings, etc.  I also saw some nice looking dessert options (Cheesecake, Tiramisu, etc).  You mark what you want, then take your menu to the counter and pay (don't forget to get a drink!  It's not listed on the menu and everything is ala-carte).Granted, it can be intimidating on your first visit since you won't be familiar with their selection options.  But there is space to stand aside and choose without feeling \"rushed\".  And for a preview of their menu, go to \"http://zasitaliancafe.com/\" ahead of time.Something I learned from their website is that you can print the menu of your choice on-line and make your choices before you come in.  Or (if you have 5 or more orders) fax in your order ahead of time.  Great for avoiding the lunch-hour rush.Now let's talk food: I LOVE the Chicken Carbonara sandwich.  Comes in 2 sizes: Traditional (large) and Thin (1/2 portion).  Nice thing is that prices vary based on size, not what TYPE of sandwich you get.  I've also had Barbecue Chicken Ranch Pizza and Sausage & Cheese Pizza.  They are small (9\" thin, cut into 6 slices) but mighty tasty.I say it's good for groups, but it really depends on the individual restaurant.  This one on Neil St. has a back room that is partitioned off and made more private from the rest of the main dining area.  Can get a tad noisy, but as a free meeting space, I'll take the noise!Overall, I have come back time and time again.  I really like the food.  I can eat by myself for under $8 and feed my family of 3 for right around $25.  Don't be intimidated, give ZA's a try next time you're in Cham-bana.",

Now that I am back I have found out that there are multiple locations which works out well. I tried this other location before the springfield avenue. Very similar experience. The prices are actually cheaper than when I was here for college due to a modification in the menu. For the pasta you get to select from multiple types and sauces with 4 toppings for 5 dollars. The premium protein items i.e shrimp, meatballs, chicken will run you a dollar more each. The food is prepared quickly, however I don't know if they changed it now to use a convection oven/microwave to nuke your toppings which is one down side. This is then added to a pan with the sauce and served quickly. You also get a nice piece of garlic bread. All and all this is better than McD and for the same price. There are also other options such as pizza, salads, sandwiches etc. I have never strayed from the pastaPro: inexpensive, quick, large portionsCons: microwaved toppings (i guess you get what you pay for)Hidden gem:Sign up for the perka app. You need to check in and tell the cashier so they can give you the punch to earn free food. I did not realize this and ended up not getting my first check-in. You can't just check-in which makes sense or people would abuse the system",

And they were so good that there have been times that I have literally made the drive just to partake of their cheese tortellini with pesto and sun dried tomatoes and salad with house dressing.  Mmm!  We came today only to find that they have taken sun dried tomatoes off of the menu as well as their house dressing!!!!!  . Words cannot convey my level of disappointment at this decision on Za's part.  I had to settle for balsamic vinaigrette which left my formerly awesome salad experience being just any old salad - certainly nothing I would travel for.  The cheese tortellini without sun dried tomatoes was still pretty decent but definitely still a disappointment.  I know you can't please everyone all of the time, but this menu overhaul does make a difference for THIS customer.  I am not saying we will not ever come, just saying we are a lot less likely now that our favorites have been axed from the menu.  I will say that I ended up switching out the balsamic (didn't really care much for it) to the Asian ginger sesame and that helped, but it still leaves me longing for the house dressing I loved so much!! I am still going to give it 3 stars because the place is cool, the service has always been good and the food is still decent.  Also, they still have an awesome iced tea bar I love (please don't get rid of the peach tea!). It just doesn't have the wow factor for me to give it the four or five I would have if I was still wowed, though.  Sorry.  .",

I like that it's an order-at-the counter type place, and the seating/atmosphere feels like a regular sit-down restaurant.I had the Mama's Broiled Tomato panini with pasta salad on the side.  It was reeeeally good.  I have no complaints.  It was flavorful and filling.  I also drank about 5 full cups of iced tea while my boyfriend and I played Scrabble.  So, I was perfectly happy with my food and drink.My boyfriend had a slightly less satisfactory experience.  He ordered a coffee with his meal, and the guy behind the counter said he'd have to brew some.  Ok, so we waited for our food to be ready and 10 minutes later my boyfriend went back up to get his coffee.  Not only was it COLD but it was also extremely watered down.  I don't know what happened but apparently the staff here don't know how to brew coffee.  The guy was nice about it and just gave us another regular drink.  But still, how is it even possible to mess coffee up that badly?Za's isn't in a particularly convenient location for me to visit it very frequently, but I'm sure I'll find some excuse to come back.  I want another one of those broiled tomato paninis...",

                "review": "Za's is good food for about the right price I'd say. That's really all you can ever ask from a restaurant. They got an incredible renovation after the fire - the upstairs rooms are now larger and filled with massive HDTVs playing music videos and the entire restaurant is now super clean which is a bonus for sure.My go to is the Mac & Cheese with Buffalo Chicken. It's incredibly filling for sure, you definitely get your money's worth with this order and the flavor is superb. I admit I find myself wishing for a bit more buffalo chicken but I love the flavors so much it's still my go-to order. It also comes with some garlic bread which is good for mopping up the leftover cheese sauce. I've also had their sandwiches and pizzas (the BBQ chicken's pretty good) and been satisfied with whatever choice I make.The customizable options on the food are good because you end up getting what you want, but they can seem to nickle and dime you. Pick you entree and then add a meat for a few bucks, add a sauce for another buck, add a drink for a few bucks, add etc for a buck....just something to be aware of when making your meal.Solid 4 star restaurant though.",

I added a bunch of salt and pepper.  The pasta was a little dry but I thought the flavor of all the vegetables was good.  The problem?  2 tomatoes, 3 thin slices of mushroom, 2 pieces of broccoli and a few slivers of carrots.  The rest was just a big carton of pasta.  I wish there would have been more veggies and less pasta..  Chocolate chip cookie: The saving grace!  It was good. And I needed it after throwing the soup and most of the pasta away.",

We had a few desserts, which were great. My wife got the creamy chicken pesto, which actually wasn't that good. I got the lasagna, which was probably 3 stars, but again - it was quick, easy and cheap. That's what Za's promotes and that's what it is. I'd go back.",

My favorite is the Market Monday prix fixe menu with ingredients selected from the saturday farmers market.  to go from fresh local ingredients on saturday morning to a full 5 course meal and wine pairings by monday night is pretty spectacular.  The last couple market night meals that i have been to have been around 40 dollars, and for an additional 25, you can get some awesome wines (highly recommended). The courses are so elegantly prepared with amazing presentation and you won't go home hungry.  I've noticed the dishes are a little too salty for my taste... actually, they're consistently salty to me (but then again this is coming from someone who barely ever salts their food) but i think you can get around it by indulging less in the amazing sauces.  and the desserts-- so delicious.  the desserts truly capture the seasons and the feel of the weather so perfectly.  I honestly don't know a better way to start the week!  if you have a bad case of the mondays, treat yourself to some bacaro.  and your spirits will be lifted. I have gone several times and enjoyed several of the menu items, and a few market nights (i hear they're introducing an occasional VEGETARIAN!!!! market menu!!) and i have never been disappointed.  The service is great, and they are very attentive.  Some servers are more knowledgeable about the wines and others know a little more about the food and preparation, but overall, they are a pleasant and fun to talk to group.  If you ask them a question and they don't know the answer, they are probably equally curious to know the answer as well-- meaning they will find you an answer even if it means hounding the chef :-) I think you definitely get what you pay for.  and for a city like champaign, bacaro is definitely a lovely gem.",

Great atmosphere, dimly lit, very nice.Service: 5 stars... we found the service to be extremely high caliber without being snooty.  We ate at NOMI in Chicago a few weeks ago and the service was comparable.  Quality and Kind... just the kind of service we adore.Food: PERFECT.  I'm not a \"foody\" but I adore good food.  The octopus was the best I've ever had.  The gnocchi was incredibly savory.  My husband tried the steak and I had the lamb special.  Both were FANTASTIC.  Wine suggestion: 4.5 Stars.  Wine was good, not great.  I'm not sure if we failed to describe what we wanted.  Would be nice to have some descriptions in the wine menu.  We've been to several nice restaurants in Chicago that provided descriptions of at least a subset of wine choices.  This is such a minor point though.We did not eat dessert as we were stuffed.I can't say enough good things about this very very special restaurant.  I'm just disappointed we took so long to finally get around to eating there.  We will be back... this is now my favorite restaurant in Champaign Urbana!!",

The Pinot Noir was delightful and the Cab Sauv was decent as well.With wine, we had a cheese plate with 5 cheeses and plenty of bread.For dinner, the risotto with rabbit was tasty.Dessert was a red velvet ice cream cake.  It was okay.  Bacaro used to have a panna cotta that was memorable to the point where, it was the one item I truly wanted to have again when returning to this spot.  Oh well, maybe next time.Overall, a great spot for good food and drink.",

The soup was merely OK and the spaghetti completely underwhelming (bland, in a runny sauce) and a huge disappointment.  I also felt that I was missing a spoon to easier roll the spaghetti in, and I don't really see the point of being given a knife instead.  Finally the Malbec I ordered (by the glass) simply shouldn't be on the menu in a fine dining restaurant.To complete my negative experience, everything on the menu was 2 to 4 dollars more expensive than the already high prices posted on their \"sample menu\" online.   To be fair, the service was fine (although not extraordinary) but obviously couldn't compensate for the rest.",

Not enough to send it back but one more grain of salt and I would have refused to eat it.  My companion suffered the same fate.  The wine list was either very expensive, they did not have it or Slovenian, not sure what's up with that.  We ended up drinking beer because we could not find anything we liked.  I'd give the place one more try just to see if perhaps this was an off night.To the other raves comparing this place to the top restaurants in NY or Chicago I would say \"oh please\"!

Wine came out about 10 min after our food on a few courses which left us unable to experience the \"pairing\" as you should. We politely and discreetly asked her to bring wine out with or right before food and I think that ticked her off. After that, she was aloof, barely explained the wine or the dishes we were being served. Water was slow to be refilled. The real kicker was the 20% automatic gratuity she added after tax on our bill! When we asked to speak to the manager, she told us \" he's busy dining with a client\". Say what??? I believe your customers are your priority! We asked a different waiter to see if he could find the manager and low and behold, out he came!  Tainted our experience and maybe our waitress was just having a bad day but when you are dropping that kind of money on dinner- you had better train your wait staff on how to properly serve and deal with customers.  It was a shame because from the chef end- he did a great job of making delicious and interesting food- it's just too bad no one explained it well or delivered it professionally.Just wanted to post an update. We received a very kind letter from owner/ manager apologizing for our experience and gave us a generous gift certificate to try them again.  We definitely will give them another chance. Again- the food is amazing and we want to see them succeed.",

I've been to Italy, and this ISN'T Italian...I suppose the entire visit was lackluster. The decor had a lot to be desired, but the wait staff were great. However, once we ordered wine (and, by the old menu at least, were supposed to receive the standard 4oz glass) things went downhill. While we were savoring the tiny portion in our glasses, the bartender was doing his best to overfill the glasses of the pretty girls at the bar. When questioned, we were told \"they asked for doubles.\" Who orders a double Merlot? We chose what appeared to be a special at the time: a smoked duck panini. What arrived at the table was a glorified ham and cheese sandwich. No, I'm not complaining about the sandwich itself, but they had substituted ham instead of smoked duck, then claimed that I wouldn't know the difference. I'm not sure if it was just this visit or the one that followed that biased me, but I'll never return.",

The servers and bartenders were knowledgeable and attentive.  We were there on a Monday so we were able to enjoy the Market Monday tasting menu, and I have to say, each dish was delicious.  Each dish was seasonal and had a great blend of flavors; I couldn't pick a dish that I didn't like.  We opted for the wine pairing and each wine matched the dish it was served with very well.  Wine has been a hobby of mine for a number of years but my wife is just getting into it, and she was blown away by the taste difference the pairings made.  I think the reviews stating that this restaurant was 'snooty' or that the service was slow are from people who don't truly understand what this restaurant is.  We spent 2 hours eating our 5 course meal.  It's a place where dining is an experience.  Come here expecting that, and come hungry.  Any complaints about small portion sizes must be coming from people ordering a la carte.  We'll be back the next time we want to have a fancy date night, without question.",

If you put the restaurant together as a whole package including the ambiance, the uniqueness of the food, and culinary innovation you would get a 3 star restaurant, however the flip side is that the culinary flavors do not resemble anything like the gastronomic experience you get when you dine at Next in Chicago or Charlie Trotters when it was still open. You pay quite a premium for the dish that are notably small. Our dinner meeting was held at this location. There is plenty of meter parking, just remember to not go over or you will likely be ticketed. I started my meal with the wagyu beef stew which had smoked potato and a bone marrow crostini. I can honestly say the crostini was amazing with bone marrow that offered an amazing umami flavoring, however the actual stew was salty, the beef was not tender by any means sort of tasting like a dinty moore stew. This cost 13 dollars and the portion size was very small. My main entree for 33 dollars was the grilled lobster tail with kale, crispy black truffle polenta, and additional lobster claw and pieces of lobster on the side with a acidic lemon tasting sauce. Once again the portion size was quite small as you see from my picture. I don't believe you get the whole lobster tail as it looked like 1/2 of a lobster tail. There was a piece of claw meat on the side and the other side was shredded lobster meat. The lobster was cooked well, tender and well flavored with the black truffle polenta balancing the seafood, however the attempt at the different texture from the arugula/kale along with the soft polenta and the lobster did not work. Our meal ended with a flourless chocolate cake with blood orange champagne foam and pomegranate jelly. The grapefruit foam hit the spot, but again the cake was a sliver and for that cost you would think the portion would be bigger. Due to the long wait for the waiter to bring the dessert menu, I ended up getting my first parking ticket in Champaign. So I agree the flavors and small portion size at this price do not make this a place that I will frequent. As another yelper said, if you want to impress your date this maybe an interesting place to try, however I am going to try to find another culinary gem elsewhere.Pros: local sustained food, changing menuCons: VERY expensive, small portion size- I left hungry, taste and texture just does not work for some dishesHidden deals:If you really want to impress your date, try the 7 course tasting menu at 85 dollars. I don' t know if that is a deal but at least you get to try everything for $$$",

Yes, despite the fact that there is a lot of mediocre food in the area, it's not the area's fault. Champaign-Urbana has fantastic terroir. There are many producers nearby making food that is world-class and Bacaro uses these ingredients to great effect. I LOVED the goat cheese salad and my rich creamy risotto. Fried sweetbreads were luscious. My boyfriend's chicken with chicken liver was delicious. I guess the only complaint is that the prices here are the same as in NYC...",

The servers are among the most professional in the C-U area. The food is genuinely sophisticated. However Bacaro's commitment to local, seasonal ingredients, while being one of its strengths, is also one of its greatest weaknesses. The menu at Bacaro is constantly changing based on what ingredients they stock. This tends to result in inconsistent dishes whose preparations are constantly changing. Of three visits I've eaten some bad, ok and great meals.Visit 1:Had halibut with some kind of crust in a mint-gazpacho. The fish was fresh and of excellent quality. This was frustrating however because the fish was coated in a greasy crust that became soggy from the fish sitting in the mint gazpacho. The gazpacho was also greasy and was not pleasantly minty. What could have been a complex, herbaceous broth, wound up tasting like greasy mouthwash. Fantastic ingredients but badly executed prep.Visit 2:Valentine's Day prix-fixe. Three courses all of which were delicious. The appetizer was some kind mediterranean type salad if I recall with olives and I think preserved lemon. Delicious and fresh! My main was halibut again, with some kind of vanilla saffron sauce. The fish was perfectly cooked and the sauce was complex and homey. My girlfriend got the steak and it was of great quality with a strong preparation to match. The dessert was a chocolate torte with blood orange sorbet- good flavors that were well-executed.Visit 3:Pork loin with mustard spaetzle. The spaetzle were delicious! I could eat that spaetzle every day. The pork however was DRY. Really, really dry. I was trying to conserve the mustard sauce on the plate in order to make sure there was enough to get on each slice of pork. It was that dry. So in closing out of three, expensive visits, the food has been good maybe 1.5 times- with me being able to say I enjoyed one complete meal (valentine's day) and the side of one of my mains (the spaetzle). If the food was consistent, Bacaro would be an easy 5-stars. Hopefully they can strike a balance moving forward between rotating fresh, seasonal ingredients and maintaining a consistently-executed menu.",

Well, Bacaro certainly deserves it: I finally went there for dinner last night (after wanting to go for several months), and I was wowed. I'm still salivating thinking about it.I went there with pretty high expectations (I'd heard great things about it from several friends and coworkers): that's usually not a good thing as it makes it easier to be disappointed, but Bacaro did not disappoint. In fact, I'm happy to say that my dinner there was on a par with my best dining experiences in NYC.First and foremost: the food. My boyfriend and I decided to share a bunch of dishes. For appetizers, we ordered the fresh mozzarella with heirloom tomatoes and pesto, as well as the roasted suckling pig with homemade sauerkraut: they were both absolutely delicious (don't miss the suckling pig!). We then shared one entree: we got the braised pork shank, which came with sauteed spinach, mushrooms, bacon, and fig sauce: soooo good! The portions are not huge, but two appetizers and one entree turned out to be enough food. For dessert, we got the panna cotta with fresh fruit: simple but just as outstanding. That was some seriously great food!!As Bacaro is also a wine lounge, their wine selection is quite extensive. We got a sampler of three wines by the glass for $14, all of which were pretty good. Not to forget the 10yo port we got with our dessert (very generous pour...), which was good also.Service was great, ambiance was great (although it's a shame that the place was so empty)... it was really a great dinner (sure, it was not cheap, but entirely worth it!). By far the restaurant in Champaign, in my opinion. I'll definitely be back.",

After trying some parmesan, which was freshly grated (about the only positive), and pepper flakes, I realized that nothing could save the dish. If you want to pay Chicago prices to impress a date, you can try Bocaro, but don't expect more than oversalted Champaign food.",

                "review": "This is my favorite place to dine in Champaign-Urbana. On our most recent visit, we ordered a few things from the new menu, all of which seemed fantastic--it was hard to choose. We had greens, octopus salad, gnocchi, and the scallop entree. Each course was just as delicious as the last. The scallop entree is so clever and very well executed--it's such a treat to have perfectly cooked, high quality seafood in the middle of Illinois. Chef Drew worked his magic with this dish. There are \"scallop potatoes\" on the plate, which blend in and look just like the actual scallop next to it. Biting into the potato is an experience, especially if you're expecting a scallop! They are divine. I could eat a whole plate of just the potatoes, I swear.We were too full to order dessert, but everything I've had in the past from the dessert menu has been phenomenal--creative, elegant and fun at the same time. Their pastry chef Lindsey is awesome! As for wine, I didn't have anything beyond Prosecco on my last visit, but I usually just allow the staff to select something for me. It's always on the money.The service is always impeccable as well--smooth, engaging when it needs to be and with a huge attention to detail. Connor took care of us on our most recent visit. He's a truce service professional--knowledgable, eager to offer suggestions and advice with the menu, but allows the experience to flow naturally. We had such a nice time with him! Plus, Julie is always there to make sure everyone is having a perfect experience.I highly recommend bacaro to anyone who is visiting CU who is looking for a polished, smooth, fine-dining experience. I would also steer visitors that way if they are just looking for a place to relax with a glass of wine. And for those of you who live in this community and have yet to try bacaro, I would say do yourself a favor and go! Treat yourself!",

We chose to do the tasting menu which was about 6 courses, complete with a cheese course and dessert.  I paired it with the wines too. The wine list was definitely impressive.  Lots of interesting wines at very fair prices. They are considered a wine bar, so I was hoping for a good list.  But I was impressed with the prices, there were many bottles on the list for under $30 which is always great to me.  It's easy to fill a list with great expensive bottles, but it is indeed very difficult to pick a variety of great wines at reasonable prices. The wines paired perfectly with each dish, I was so happy.  About the food... I was just so impressed.  The octopus over german potato salad was unlike anything I've ever had, and just so delicious.  Yes, it does sound strange but it was so well done, and the octopus was cooked just perfectly, it was so tender.  I was so thrilled the chef has decided to include this as one of the courses.  We had a big scallop seared and served over corn salsa which was almost sweet but just delicious.  We also had braised rabbit, which again was tender and also quite flavorful sitting in a pool of broth, with some tomatoes, and homemade pasta.  The rib eye for the main course was flavorful and again very tender.  The cheese course was fun.  And I loved thin very rich slice of chocolate dessert.  To be honest, I was simply amazed at the quality of these dishes.  Sure it is a more expensive dinner out, but for the quality and caliber of the dishes, it is a steal!! This is easily one of my most memorable and favorite dining experiences.  Easily 5 stars for Bacaro!!",

Really kudos there. Portions are small - you probably would expect that in this sort of establishment. We opted for a la carte options.  I don't mind paying top dollar for great food, but the total for two people prix fixe with wine substitution is $240 before tip.  Now again, I don't mind paying, but there are michelin starred restaurants in fabulous cities that are not -this- expensive.  This is Champaign, a small but charming place in central Illinois.  Wife and I had a bottle of wine, two pasta entrees, and two desserts to the tune of about $110 after a nice tip (20-25%) - You can eat reasonably here if you avoid the prix fixe menu. The food was great.  Everything was jam packed with flavor, perfectly cooked, and elegantly presented. Would definitely return for another 'date night' or special occasion.  Definitely not a place to go for dinner if you're looking for grub, though.",

There was presentation to the entire experience, which is something I've found a little lacking since moving to Champaign.I wouldn't want to eat in the bar area on a Saturday night, and if the hostess hadn't been able to move us into the other room we would have had to leave.  My dad can't hear very well and his hearing is better than my lip reading.  The bar area is really nice and I'd love to eat there on a Tuesday, which I have.The good:  The food.  Three people, three different dishes, and everybody liked theirs.  I had the halibut and mom had the rabbit, and if you're going in there soon, I'd recommend either, and even more I'd recommend the vichyssoise with crab and asparagus.  If you're hardline vegetarian (I eat fish) then you'll have problems with the menu, but I believe the waitress at least implied that the chef would make allowances/prepare something else?  Either way you should call ahead and see.  I have no complaints about oversalting like other reviewers, perhaps they listened?  The malbec we drank with dinner was a nice random choice.The bad:  Our waitress was new.  At least I hope she was new.  The service was great but she wasn't as familiar with the menu or wine list as someone working at that caliber of restaurant should be.The manhattans were terrible.  I suspect Bacaro of being yet another restaurant who thinks they should have their own special manhattan, with exotic bitters and cherry juice and... do you think you're going to save me from scurvy or something?  I want bourbon, bitters, and sweet vermouth, and go easy on everything but the bourbon.  This is no time for creativity.The dessert menu is stupid.  Who follows octopus and rabbit with banana bread and ice cream?  Hire a dessert chef.I would totally recommend Bacaro if you need \"fancy dinner out.\" Sometimes I do.  Sometimes I have parents who need impressing.",

On the whole, the food was very good, but the overall experience fell short of my expectations for other dinners of similar quality that I have had elsewhere.   First, the atmosphere of the restaurant, while nice, did not strike me as anything special.  That said, this could be a product of where I sat.   Even though I placed a reservation close to a week in advance, I found myself sitting at the table nearest to the kitchen with my date.  While she had a view of downtown Champaign and the restaurant's interior, my own view was of a row of temperature controlled wine racks and a junky-looking electrical socket near the kitchen's entrance.     For the appetizer, we had the pizzetta, which didn't strike me as anything special:  just bread, cheese, grape tomatoes, onion, and bacon.   Our entrees-- the braised rabbit and the grouper-- were better, but as others have mentioned, the portions were quite small, even for a restaurant focused on contemporary fine-dining.  Thanks to a bottle of wine and a second helping of bread, nobody left hungry, but with the final bill clocking in at close to $120, it was hard not to walk away with a sense that some of that money could be better spent elsewhere.         Ultimately, in giving Bacaro three stars, I am rating it in the context of other \"fine-dining\" establishments.  The restaurant's chefs clearly know how to cook, and their wait staff is very well trained, but I don't think that either the food nor the space warrants the price that they have set on it.",

I always preferred Radio Maria, Escobar or some other place for a nice meal. So before we set out on a Friday night for Bacaro, I decided to Yelp it and I was (and still am) very suspicious of a few of the reviews.  Here was a place with lots of 1 & 2 star reviews and yet a couple of 5 star reviews, written in great length and gushing detail by Yelpers for whom this was their only review.  So who writes their first and only review in great length and never mentions anything they ordered, just summarizing it as an excellent restaurant, then never subsequently reviews any other restaurant?  I may be a cynic, but it raises red flags....So, we set off to do our own independent research:  Three people on a Friday night.  The place is full, we get one of a couple of available tables, with no reservations.  The waitress was wonderful.  My first requirement to enjoy a restaurant experience is good service, and she was great.  She knew the menu, she was unequivocal when we asked her what she liked.  She kept her distance and watched us for cues, never interrupting a conversation and never rushing us nor ever making us wait.The wine list is huge, the drink list is equally huge, but both are very pricey by Champaign standards. My wife's martini was a very full glass, all the way up to the \"c\" section as we Assembly Hall fans would say.We had a risotto special with fish \"for the table\", one mixed green salad, and one fried pork belly starter.  The pork belly was $10 and was the size of a large marshmallow in the center of a 12 inch plate, humorous by its dinkyness. But good, like a chunk of fried bacon fat.Then we had three entrees, all were very good.  Mine was the grouper ($28) and frankly I don't recall my companion's meals because we also knocked down one martini and two bottles of Cote D' Rhone between the three of us.  The Cote D' Rhone was $28/bottle and the lowest price wine on the list.  Several other wines could be had in the high $30's, and then the rest of the list was north of $40.One apple pie ala mode later and the three of us were out of there for $192 before tip; and she was worth the $40 tip we left, so by the end of the day it approached $77 per person.So if you start a Yelp review at a three, this place gets one more star for having a great server, one star for being in DT Champaign and being beautiful inside & out, including cloth hand towels in the loo.  Then I'll knock one star off for being too pricey for the market, but if Yelp allowed half-stars I'd give Bacaro 4.5.",

We didn't go for the menu tasting but instead we ordered a couple of entrees. My wife had the chicken and I had the ribeye. Both were cooked very nicely and the unique ingredients made the meals slightly different, but for the prices they charge the taste of each was really just average. My steak wasn't very tender or all that flavorful. Her chicken was cooked decently enough but again the flavor was really just average. I thought maybe because we were there on the Sunday before Labor Day, that maybe it was an off night. But I just couldn't get past the fact that when a place must such a high price on their menu, there really shouldn't be such a thing as an \"Off Night\". The atmosphere and the waiter we had were very nice. So here is my take. Wait staff 3-4 starsAtmosphere 4-5 starsWine list 4-5 StarsBeer list 3-4 starsMenu 4-5 stars Food 2-3 stars I probably wouldn't go here again just because its priced to high to take a chance on a very average meal.

Bacaro is one of the most upper-endish restaurants around, so I had to give it a try.I liked the atmosphere, very modern and mood-setting, and the staff was nice. The food however was just a bit too out of the ordinary for me. I prefer classic dishes done to a high standard over the creative and stronger-flavored inventions they had here. I found the food more interesting than delicious, which in the end left me a little disappointed.If your palette is bored, adventurous, and experienced you might like Bacaro, I'm not quite there yet.",

They seem to be particular to detail, which is a plus to me!The wine is top notch too.Honestly, anyone who finds Bacaro pretentious must be insecure, or needs to be more social. Good Lord, fine dining people!! You pay for what you get.ALSO!! Thad has also mentioned to me how he likes his business to have less seating so its about quality, and not quantity.

We shared a couple of appetizers and entrees and everyone loved every dish we had.  The resounding favorite was the octopus appetizer which was tender and flavor- full.   The beef tenderloin was charred nicely on the exterior and was cooked to a perfect pink.  The seared scallops with Myers Lemon were refreshing and light.  The gnocci was a showstopper as was the risotto with black truffles and the duck breast.  We asked Thad, the chef, to choose a bottle of wine based on our menu selections which enhanced the experience!  The entrees run between $25-$32 and makes a great choice for a special occasion.",

We ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, and, because I wasn't feeling very adventurous, chose the oven roasted chicken as my entre.  Overall, I found both these dishes a little too salty (maybe the chef was just having an off night?).  The portions are modest, but you would probably expect a little more for the price you're paying.  They did have a decent cheesecake and the check came out with a couple yummy chocolate chip meringues, but overall I guess I was a little disappointed.In consensus with what many others have said, service was very attentive, but I felt it was almost to the point of pretentiousness.  Based on this experience alone, I would most likely not recommend Bacaro's nor dine here again, but I really don't want to dislike this establishment and would like to come back again sometime in the future and give it another chance.  Until then, I say stick with Radio Maria.",

This is a place that I go to before I go out, and I like that you can eat and function after.  I like the decor.  I have read a few reviews that did not like it, and I do understand them, but I love the Danish modern look.  It was done tastefully, and with some thought.If I have one complaint it would be that when I am there I can't decide what to get.  Small menu, but you end up wanting everything on it.

Just when I thought I couldn't eat any thing more fabulous, I had the peanut butter ice cream, which was amazing. I went to Bacaro again tonight (Tuesday April 7) and started with the octopus appetizer, which was startling in a fantastic way in its tomato sauce with shaved chorizo sausage--who knew such flavors could brilliantly mix? I followed this with the strip steak, which exceeded expectations in its deliciousness and perfect serving preparation and size. Although full, I had to finish this outstanding meal with the never-to-disappoint, peanut butter ice cream. It is velvety smooth. As always, my servers, Kyle and Sara were excellent--both knowledgeable and competent. They served an outstanding meal. Bacaro is definitely the place to treat yourself, which never disappoints.",

Food ranges from very good to amazing.  We've never had a bad meal at bacaro.You can throw down a lot of money here, but you don't need to.  The bar is great, they have reasonable and interesting wines by the glass, and you can have a few appetizers or smaller courses and leave without spending too much and but still feeling like you had a special night out.Highly recommended.",

It had a really nice atmosphere, quality food, and good wine.I was impressed that time was taken to talk to my wife and I to find a wine to pair with both of our meals.  The pairing was correct and the wine went well with our meals.  It was somewhat amazing also the fact that it wasn't a very expensive wine that was suggested.This is a very good place to eat in the Champaign area.  The reason I gave it 5/5 (instead of 4/5) is because even though the food is a little over priced in my mind, the service, atmosphere, and location lend to it receiving a 5/5.",

I ordered 3 items, no meat and no drink and the bill was $15. When I questioned that I explained I had wanted the small bowl, she hadn't ask, and the side soup. It came down to $10. I still felt that was pretty high. She seemed extremely annoyed that I was bothering her with this, and I kind of wanted to tell her \"honey, if you don't like your job, work someplace else.\" The food was just okay. At that price I would have liked enough to take home, but, the small portions were pretty measly and I finished it there. Someone had dumped an entire order of macaroni and cheese in the middle of the floor, and I got to stare at it while I ate. At no point did anyone come clean it up while I was there. I won't be going back anytime soon.",

Parking can be difficult since this is located in campustown, more-so when school is session, of course.  Frequently there is a line, so you may have to wait.  They do move through the ordering line quickly though.  They will give you a number and then either bring you your food (if you are staying in) or call you up (if you are doing take-out). i really like that you can pick whatever noodles/soup with whatever meat option you desire. I think there used to be a menu option that I got, but it doesn't exist anymore.  The last time I ate there, I got the pad thai- which was terrible.  I don't recommend that at all.  My parents love the thai curry soup...especially when under-the-weather. The bread is really good.  And their rice krispie treats are nice and gooey.",

The fast food chains did not look appealing. But this little spot, with a huge selection, plenty of seating, and fast service, filled the bill perfectly. I can't give it four stars because the food was uneventful. I had the Indonesian peanut saute with grilled chicken. The rice noodles were decent, the sprouts and peanuts were fine, the seasoning was nice and spicy, and it came quick and warm. My wife had the tomato basil bisque off their Mediterranean menu. She said it was like eating spaghetti sauce without the spaghetti. Not a destination, but a good lunch alternative.",

I like the variety of choices, but it can get a bit overwhelming, if you keep on wondering to yourself if the particular combination you picked will actually taste good or not. I have stuck with western-style pasta, as opposed to asian noodles (why eat faux noodles at this place when you can walk a block and have real pho noodles?). A regular bowl of noodles, meat, and a side soup will run you $8-10, which isn't enough to fill me up completely, but it is nice to enjoy some well-cooked noodles once in a while. The atmosphere is pretty great, perfect for groups of people and for individuals. It actually feels like a fast-food place disguised as a restaurant. It's very roomy inside, and there are huge windows that let you look out onto the busiest corner of campustown.",

I don't particularly like their vegan options, but if I had to choose, I would go with a dairy-free Penne Rosa with tofu.",

I was looking forward to the beef stroganoff which use to be my favorite many many years ago. Luckily school is out so we got parking on the same street as the restaurant. Ordering was simple, you pick and chose from a picture menu. Many of the dishes require you to pay more for protein, some are built into the cost. The food came rather quickly. I agree with Yelp reviewer Xi S., portions are significantly smaller than I remember. I don't know if NC removed another size to the dish, but this was a lot smaller than I remember. The noodles were slightly under cook and the lack of sauce was rather troubling as many of my bites were just plain noodles. Also the employees do not appear that they want to be working here at all. Now that I have tried it, I think I will pass the next time I get an email coupon....Pros: Lots of different asian inspired noodle dishes, quickCons: small portion size, disinterested employees, under cooked noodle and lack of sauceHidden deals:1. Use the Hooked app which gives you additional savings. Dinner time savings was 2 dollar off an entree2.

If you've been to one before, then you should know what to expect, it's more or less the same.  For those of you who haven't been to one, they offer slightly higher prices than you'd like to pay (but not enough that you'd outright stop going), and a somewhat large variety of noodles, ranging from Oriental to your standard Mac&Cheese options, as well as soups and salads.  Most of their more exotic dishes range from okay to the not-so-surprising 'WTH was I thinking when I ordered that' response, but a few are really good and worth coming back for.  Personally, I don't eat here unless someone else really wants to go, and then I usually order the Mac&Cheese which is my current favorite there.  Plain and simple noodles with a bunch of gooey freshly melted cheese.  Yum.  One good thing about it is that it is located in the heart of campus, so it's a convenient place to stop in for lunch or some other quick meal.  It is surrounded on several sides by completely glass windows, though, so it can be a little strange getting some private time with people from the street looking in at you.",

There are a huge amount of drink options, from wine to organic milk. Another great thing is that they have nice brochures with nutrition info and lots of healthy food options. Unfortunately, I find the food at  Noodles to be very inconsistent. Sometimes my field green salad is great, other times it is just a bunch of bland iceberg lettuce. Other selections, even those labeled spicy, are a little on the bland side. Unfortunately it's also quite pricey for campus-town and it's often incredibly crowded during lunch. Another thing that annoys me is the excessive packaging for takeout: fancy bags and containers resembling tupperware are wasteful even if they are labeled \"made with a chemical to speed up breakdown.\"But I still come back. They have food that is reasonably healthy and gives me a good dose of protein. I also like the variety of the menu. I love that I can get potstickers with my tomato soup, so that keeps me coming back.",

I ordered the Pad Thai with chicken...and it was probably one of the most terrible things I've ever been served.  It was absolutely bland and half of the noodles weren't even cooked.  I couldn't eat it; I had to just throw it away!  I wasn't expecting a great Thai dish, just something edible.   So today I was running errands near Noodles and thought I would give it another try.  I ordered the Wisconsin Mac and Cheese, thinking I couldn't possibly go wrong with their \"most ordered' dish.  Unfortunately, my meal very disappointing again. It was just very plain.  Not enough sauce for all the noodles, and the sauce that was in the dish barely had any flavor.  Not worth it. I'm not sure if these issues are related to this particular store, to consistency issues, or just to poor recipes.  Either way, my two experiences warrant a rating around 1 or 2.  I'm going with a 2 since it is a nice-looking place....and they must be doing something right since it's always so crowded!  I'm just no longer willing to keep ordering until I finally find something that is ok.",

It is on the north east corner of Lincoln Square near the federal court house.  Also very close to the new Urbana location of the Food Co-Op.The space is smaller but the food is just as good as ever. The menu is simpler but most of the favorites are still on it and evidently a few older favorites have been brought back.   Harold, the owner, said he is still developing a new menu for the new place so it will be revised and expanded. He also said they will be open for breakfast on Saturday mornings when the Farmer's Market is running.  They will sell bread and pasta at the market. There is still a full service bar.We have eaten in the new location three times so far and like the fact that some of the decor has been carried over from the old location.  The place was either full or pretty full each time we went.  We did not have to wait for a table but we saw a few people wait 5-10 minutes. We were there once on a Wednesday night and Donnie Heitler was playing his keyboard just like he did at the old place. I could hear him better due to the smaller space.  I'd guess the new space seats about 75-80 people. The Minestrone (MARCOSTRONE) soup is still good. So was the spaghetti carbonara.  I had never had that previously and found it was like a breakfast pasta dish - with bacon!!  We also had that night Mardis Gras Pasta which was also a winner. We also had a pesto pasta dish which was good. The wait staff have smaller (sq feet) areas to cover in this new location so I felt like they were in closer contact - a good thing in general in a restaurant.** This is the old Milo's location.  Milo's has moved to their new digs in SE Urbana just off the intersection of Windsor Road & Philo Road.I have been eating at the Great Impasta for a lot of years and the owner is a friend.  But I am not just hyping the place - I just wanted folks to know it is open in a new location with many of the old staff and the food is still good.",

Nothing of that is left, the memories barely. My girlfriend tried a vegetable salad with tuna [not a tuna salad], as per the description. Of course, we expected a small piece of freshly cooked tuna. Instead, a couple of vegetables of debatable quality, topped with small pieces of fishy-smelling (MORE than fish is supposed to smell fishy anyway) disgusting tuna TAKEN FROM A CAN. Excuse me, a salad of EXPENSIVE RESTAURANT quality is not supposed to use 20 cents-worth ingredients. My main dish was an EXPENSIVE seafood lasagna which, again, was one of the most execrable pieces of culinary garbage I've ever eaten in the wonderful Urbana-Champaign. Gee, an honest sandwich from Jimmy Johns is many degrees of magnitude better and healthier. The Great Impasta masterpiece was extremely salty, with cheap, salty - did I mention salty? - ingredients (again, small, cheap shrimps FROM A CAN), heavy on the cheap shrimp, with little of the other seafood spelled out in the menu detectable in the real dish. A heavy, unsavory, poorly cooked bechamel sauce that made me feel uneasy for the rest of the day. I don't consider myself an excellent cook, but I cook better than that, drunk. I was brave and I ate part of my dish, because I was hungry. My stomach didn't thank me. My friend barely touched her salad, and returned it uneaten. The staff behaved as if nothing was wrong. A lot of money for food which is literally worse than the worst fast food I've ever eaten. Our stomachs were suffering... if you go to The Great Impasta make sure you've got stellar health insurance, you might need it. When it comes to restaurant food, the rapport between high prices and execrable quality makes The Rotten Impasta a champion of bad taste, in more than one sense.  Bottom line: avoid like the plague.",

Paintings and candles accent a ceiling painted with grapevines. The food I had was amazing- the salads nicely seasoned, the olive oil of the highest quality, the ravioli gorgonzola rich and creamy, and the blueberry carrot cake moist and divine. I can attest to some of their ingredients because many of them are local and from farms I know- try the Prairie Fruit Farms goat cheese tart for a real treat if it is available. The chef tries hard to incorporate lots of ingredients from local farms. To make the experience perfect, the service I had was absolutely wonderful. Highly recommended.",

                "review": "Today is St. Joseph's Day, a day that in Italy and many traditional Italian-American households is as special as St. Patrick's Day is to the Irish, and a day rich in food rituals.  To mark the occasion, I decided that after work I would have a multi-course dinner at one of Champaign-Urbana's \"Italian\" restaurants.  Let me first preface my review with some background.  I was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY, in a traditional Italian-American household where food was a centerpiece of family life and the table was the \"sacra tavola\" or sacred table.  I dined in restaurants in Little Italy and Brooklyn where the wait staff was fresh \"off the boats\" and barely spoke English and the owners and chefs were all old school Italians who had menus often hand-written and dictated by what was fresh and available in the markets and there was a sense of tradition in the entire dining experience.  Their tables were often occupied by members of \"La Famiglia\" but we won't go there.  I have no such high expectations from the local \"Eye-talian\" businesses.  Anyway, I decided upon The Great Impostor , er, Impasta.  The dcor bordered on tacky, with prints of Italian posters taped to the sides of the booths.  Tape?  Really?  Service was slow and perfunctory.  The meal started with bread, olive oil, and cheese for the dipping.  The oil seemed decent enough but the cheese was not Parmigiano Reggiano.  I ordered a glass of the house Chianti, which was drinkable.  For my appetizer, I chose the Sausage in Crust.  The sausage was unremarkable and under-seasoned and the crust was bone dry.  The small side of greens was nicely dressed but rather limp.  My main course was the Linguini Pescatore, described as clams, mussels and shrimp with spicy marinara and ripe olives served over homemade linguini.  The mussels were borderline, the shrimp decently done, and the clams of questionable origin.  The sauce had a nice spice to it but did not encourage the ritual \"fare la scarpetta\", which means to wipe your plate clean with a piece of bread.  The olives appeared to be sliced black olives from a can.  The linguine was cut so short that it defied twirling on the fork.  I indulged myself with dessert on this special holiday.  As expected, no Sfinge de San Giuseppe, a traditional pastry, on the menu, so I opted for the Tiramisu and a cup of espresso with a splash of Sambuca.   The latter was fine, the former was nothing special.  Perhaps this seems a harsh review.  Many people may like the \"Eye-talian\" food offered in C-U's restaurants, likely because that is what they are accustomed to.  I like some of the Mexican and Chinese food here but I'm sure that Mexicans and Chinese raised on the authentic cuisine may find it not up to their standards.  So it is with ethnic cuisine.  A lot just depends upon what you are used to.",

                "review": "We're new to Champaign-Urbana and decided to try The Great Impasta after reading that it serves fresh/homemade pasta. My husband and I went with our families who were helping us move in. When we arrived, we were promptly seated at our reserved table. I should have realized than an almost empty restaurant on a Saturday night is never a good thing. I picked up my bread plate to move it and saw a squashed tomato underneath.  We then proceeded to wait at least 20 minutes to even be served water or asked for our drink order. When we finally got around to order, we had to listen to a pretentious and inattentive server. When my  mother-in-law (not a foodie) asked for her tuna medium well, the server told her that it's only good if served rare and it was a crime to serve medium-well, which was very rude. I agree a tuna steak should be seared and gets dried out and flavorless past medium-rare- but- there are better ways to approach the situation. Perhaps suggest that the chef likes to prepare it medium rare, but we have a nice salmon that you may enjoy more. The menu indicated that the Fettuccine Alfredo sauce had egg in it (which is not authentic Alfredo) and I asked if the chef could leave out the egg because I was pregnant and unable to have eggs that were not fully cooked (Hollandaise and Bernaise  sauce, Caesar dressing, and homemade ice cream are also on the forbidden list for the same reason). A halfway decent chef should be able to do this with their eyes closed- especially since Alfredo is traditionally only butter and Parmegiano-Reggiano or Parm-Butter-Heavy Cream.  The waiter would not even go back and ask the chef about this- he simply refused (and this was for health purposes- not taste preference- I am visibly 7 months pregnant), again, rudely. We then inquired about the ravioli, which it turns out, is not made fresh, and the pasta with clam sauce- which is made with canned clams- not fresh ones. How was the food we actually ordered? Bad. I ordered a fettuccine with chicken and what was supposed to be a bacon/cream/white wine sauce. It was so bland, no amount of salt or grated cheese could salvage the dish. No hint of bacon or wine or any aromatics like garlic or shallot. The \"fresh fettuccine\", which should be thin and light, was so thick and dense- I would rather eat dried Barilla fettuccine or the refrigerated Buitoini stuff from the supermarket.  My husband ordered pasta with a red sauce that resembled Prego- it was so sweet and pasty. My mother ordered the salmon, which came rare. She prefers her salmon medium/medium-well and asked the server to please bring it back to the kitchen and cook further. He told  her \"it's supposed to be that way.\" A good server would have said, I'm sorry, I will take care of this right away- and done it- NOT argued with the customer. You couldn't pay me to go back. I've had better meals at the Olive Garden- and that isn't saying much.",

I got a ginormous portion of pasta that I couldn't even eat half of even though it was completely delicious.Our waiter didn't pester us at all, but we always had everything we needed.  Second basket of bread, full water glasses, suggestions about drinks.  Even the clientele was less offensive than average.

We decided to embrace a restaurant with a ridiculous, punny title, and a cartoon picture of a man with a wonky, paintbrush mustache.  Great decision.The Great Impasta is a half block east of Neil Street in downtown Champaign and despite teh fact that their outside tables were covered in construction worker dust, the staff was friendly and self-effacing enough to jokingly clean them off for us so we could enjoy the balmy Saturday evening (on nights like these, if I close my eyes, I can pretend I'm back home in San Diego, sigh).The stuffed mushrooms were good, although not the highest quality, but the bartender was ON POINT.  I asked him on a whim to make me something \"silly and dangerous, with a hint of vanilla\" (because i'm an ass and I can ask things like this.  Don't try it at home).He came back with a mix of kahlua, grand marnier, vanilla vodka, bailey's, and a chocolate liquor.  He then apologized for putting a bit more vodka than he planned, but it was fantastical.  We named it a \"Cow of Color,\" since brown cow sounded too...cliche.Our server, Lara, was funny, outgoing, friendly and helpful with charm and a great attitude.  She helped us choose some delicious pasta dishes that weren't too heavy and just flavorful enough, and I admit I went for a cream/chicken dish.  Whatevs.  I'll run tomorrow while hating my new waist size.More important, however, was the slightly hilarious decor provided by one of the staff, who paints pictures, including watercolors of her fellow employees.  Imagine our surprise when Liz and I saw the busboy's painted visage staring prominently at us from a main wall.  It was more fun to pretend to be interested in buying the painting just to make him uncomfortable.The Great Impasta lost their lease on that corner so they're only in business on Church Street until December 31.  Then the spot becomes a bank (WTF), while they hunt for a new location.  Go while you can.  The food is good, the bartenders amenable, the staff fantastic.  Go now.  Log off the damn computer, hop a flight if you have to.  I'll even pick you up from Willard airport if I have to.  I have a feeling Champaign will be missing something when our large mustachioed friend is gone.",

The risotto itself was underwhelming, with more green peas in it than actual rice grains. The shrimp was overcooked and tough. Worse, I couldn't even taste a hint of saffron. Needless to say we were not impressed.Another friend had the mushroom and asparagus linguine with prosciutto. The pasta was of an unappetizing soft texture and the dish was overly greasy. The prosciutto tasted more like salted pork.Their only redeeming feature was the crab cake appetizer.I don't think I could recommend this place to anyone after what they served  us for dinner yesterday.

What makes it so great is you can taste the freshness of each of the ingredients in every dish. Each option is carefully crafted to display the perfect balance or flavors. The menu options do change due to seasonal availability for veggies/fruit which means there is always something new to try! While the prices are a little bit higher than other sit down places, it is definitely worth it.",

Absolutely no seasoning on anything left the entire meal bland and uninteresting.  The exception being two overly sweet sauces that did not really enhance the food and seemed out of place.  Not a salt or pepper shaker in sight, platters put down with no serving utensils and scarce wait staff.  The entire service disrupted concentrating on the speaker.  Several commented they felt hungry afterwards because the food lacked flavor.Also, the drinks menu is too eclectic.  Not everyone is interested in craft beers and the mixed drink options were very limited.",

Or something like that.What about the food, you say? Good question. The portions are tiny. There is one steak on the menu - a hanger steak. You just always leave feeling let down.",

They have put a great deal of thought into the atmosphere and aesthetic of the restaurant but not enough into what the customer wants to eat.  I have visited three times and each time I go I come away a little more disappointed.  The unique menu loses its appeal when the food is more satisfying to look at on the plate than it is to taste.  The ice cream sandwich dessert was perhaps the toughest dessert I have ever ordered at any restaurant.  Their one vegetarian friendly option was mac and cheese which gets tiresome to vegetarians.  With the volume of alternative diets being practiced, especially in a college town, I assumed a trendy place like this one would cater more to the non-traditional eater.  Their new twists on traditional food abandons the American-fare loving customer, as well as the non-traditionalists.",

A great, locally sourced, and seasonally rotating menu that has quite a bit of variety in terms of flavor as well as price. So if you're a cheapskate always looking to get the most for your money (like me =D) then you won't find Big Grove too bad. If you're also looking to empty your wallet they can accommodate that as well. The interior is hip, but not too hip, and I find the layout of the place pretty comfortable.The service here varies from day to day and depending on when you're dining, although I don't recall ever having a less than decent experience. Service staff is always very attentive and friendly and the food is always prepared well. They also have neat specials from time to time like half off house cocktails on Tuesdays! Overall a great place to go with a group or a date. Especially in the summer months when the patio is open!P.S. One of my favorite places for brunch in the area. If you don't care for the dinner selections you should definitely try the place Sat/Sun morning.",

They seem preoccupied with where you sit. When I arrived and told them we're a group of people coming in for happy hour, the server and his manager tried to steer us toward high bistro tables. The restaurant was basically empty, and I asked if we can instead push 2 regular tables in the bar area together so everyone in the party could talk with each other. They seemed annoyed and the manager made a point of saying she would check to make sure our server \"didn't mind.\" Did I mention the restaurant was empty? I would think  they would want customers and make them feel welcome. Afterwards when the bill came we asked why they didn't charge the advertised happy hour prices. The server said that's only if you sit AT the bar. We sat at tables. Wow. Bottom line: This is not a customer-focused place.",

The food is fantastic, and as much as possible locally sourced. I love the Big Grove burger with fried egg on top, as well as the mac and cheese and tater tots appetizer. Because of the local aspect of the ingredients, expect to pay $2-3 more than you would at a local chain, but the improved atmosphere and deliciousness definitely make it worth it!",

The OC soundtrack is playing, the menu comes on little clipboards with the farms listed on it, and there is no salt or pepper shakers on any of the tables. It seemed pretentious to me. But for the most part, everything I tried here was tasty.We had the fried cheesy grits, french fries with malt vinegar aioli, and pickled veggies for an appetizer. I didn't try the vegetables because pickled stuff is not for me. The other two passed the test.For dinner, I ordered the macaroni and cheese. In retrospect I wish I would have ordered the vegetarian version because there was so much bacon in this that it actually took away from the goodness of the cheese. But +1 for it being piping hot.The rest of the family had a pork tenderloin, beef short rib, and burger. I tasted the short rib and the burger- the rib was a little salty but still good. The burger was flavorful but for me (and this is just a personal preference) the mixture of meats made it a little too soft.We did have dessert- Gooey butter cake and a chocolate pot-de-creme. The butter cake fell a little short. I was expecting it to be warm and gooey. It was cold, not gooey, but still rich. The pot-de-creme, was... *kisses fingers like an italian chef* Perfectly bittersweet, rich rich rich, and topped with vanilla whipped cream that I could see the little vanilla speckles in. Nom.Our server was really cool and seemed to genuinely enjoy his job. He kept referring to the chef as \"chef,\" like \"chef makes this, and chef did that\" which was kind of irksome, just because its like... you're in Champaign IL, chef. Come back down to earth a little.",

It's a blend of beef, bison & pork, you can add cheese, and it has an aioli on top.  I've tried it bunless, and the meal is equally as satisfying sans bun bc the meat is so juicy and flavorful!Each time you dine in, you get a little tin of complimentary seasoned popcorn of the day.  Nice touch.  Another nice touch is the olive oil drizzle you can request on the vanilla ice cream for dessert!On my latest visit, I wandered in at brunch time and tried the chilaquiles.  Based on my previous dinners here, I had high hopes for the dish, but my heart sank with my first bite, as the pulled chicken was cold.  I was able to find a few pieces that were lukewarm, but that was disappointing.  The two poached eggs were bordering on cold too, so they had obviously been poached earlier.  Atleast the tortilla chips were crunchy...  I also appreciated the fresh cup of decaf brought to me mid-meal, since the kitchen had just brewed a fresh pot.  I would've enjoyed a meal as hot as that coffee!Last notes: I liked the strings of lights hanging from the ceiling, ornaments hanging by the bar, and snowflakes drawn in the window.  Very festive!  Music playing was right up my alley too, so I enjoyed the ambiance.",

We were all skeptical since we live in Chicago and never had a really good meal in Champaign - always average to below average.  This place surprised all 6 of us and we all ordered different things - the appetizers were great - deviled eggs and fried brussel sprouts - both great and I usually don't like deviled eggs.  I got the burger and it was real good - they forgot to put the egg on it like i ordered but brought me out an egg minutes later.  the drinks were really good too - had a bullet old fahioned.  All in all, definitely glad we went there and will definitely go back on the next visit.",

The welcome snack is a daily-fresh made popcorn with a rotating seasoning.  Ours was crazy good, but we had to ask the server to place the flavor:  cumin & orange zest!  Apparently the chef regularly changes it.The tap and bottle list is craft beer lover's friend. Not trying to outdo a number-of-taps contest, but all the right choices were there. Especially loved the slightly sarcastic \"These Beers?\" bottom of section of the menu for those who want a Bud Light instead.Tater tots are like nothing you've seen: homemade and tasty with an apple sauce. The smoked bacon practically jumped off the deviled eggs.The menu feels relatively small when you're used to the pages and pages on your typical chain.  And I wouldn't mind if they expanded it a bit, but there were so many good looking items, I think it will take several visits without any boredom. That most of the ingredients are locally bought makes it worth it.Service was exactly what you expect from a place like this: a whole step above any chain restaurant. Constant attention, knowledgeable about the food, funny and warm, but never over-intrusive. Perfect!Nice job, Big Grove Tavern.  We'll be back.",

The mix of mustard flavor and turkey was a good mix.Trout hash: Nice clean flavors with a mix of nice vegetable elements such as corn and green onion.Deviled egg: Good texture with nice crispy chip but wasn't a huge fan of the yolk.Spiced nuts: Fresh and tasty, nothing unusual from other good spiced nuts however.Fresh baked soft pretzel: Nice mustard but the pretzel itself was a bit tough.Cornbread: Nice corn flavor and texture, one of the best items of the meal.Overall, a nice choice if you're not visiting Desithl nearby but a little pricey.",

This is the third time I've eaten here, so I feel qualified at this point to pass judgement. My impressions so far:The food is great...although the dinner portions tend to weigh in on the \"smaller\" side.  I had the filet, and what it lacked in size it made up for in taste. It was well cooked and tasted excellent. However, the side that came with it (a mixture of small carrots and potatoes) left something to be desired. This isn't a place you'll go for dinner and take home any leftovers.  The Risotto also tasted great, and while it also wasn't a huge portion, it seemed to be enough to suffice.  The prices were also fairly reasonable for a medium-to-upper scale restaurant, except for the $8 cocktail which seemed on the skimpy side, size-wise.Two other standouts at this place for me are the deviled eggs appetizers ($1 a piece, and delicious!) and the Tavern Burger, which is a mixture of beef, pork, and bison and is the reason I will keep going back.  For my money, it's one of the best burgers in town.",

However, the special pork shank and beans seemed a bit of a miss, and the mac and cheese, although quite tasty, was so large and rich and hot that it was difficult to enjoy-maybe it could be a small appetizer, side?  The chef at Big Grove definitely puts out quality, tasty food that re-imagines the standard Midwestern menu.  I applaud that. However, some of the details were slightly troubling: out of draw item (burger) at 7:00 PM; slight gaffe on menu 'These beers?'; one dish that didn't quite work.3.5",

Deviled egg doggy bag anyone... or just me?I had the turkey sandwich, which had so much flavor for a turkey sandwich!  Loved the bread, the cheese, the spreads.  Also ordered at our table was the Tavern Burger (which looked like a big, juicy meatball) and the chicken sandwich.Their menu looks different now, which means rotating sandwich toppings and mains = never gets boring.  Their salads, bar snacks and starters all look amazing this time around too.I plan to make this a regular lunch spot when I'm in the area.

The staff was excellent - friendly, helpful with menu selections, and accommodating. The menu itself is charming - and the attention to the farm-to-table detail is commendable. There's seasoned popcorn on the table - a nice touch. I tried the very economical \"If It's From The Vine It's Fine\" daily wine special, which was quite a brilliant surprise for the price. I would recommend this to anyone. The take on a wedge salad - using bibb lettuce - was inspired. I was surprised there was no bread served with the salad. And, while I realize this is the chef's preference, I wanted some to sop up a little of the salad's very tasty creamy herb vinaigrette. And so I asked for some bread. And received some lovely bread to accompany the salad. For a main I ordered the Tavern Burger - a monster of beef, bison & pork, red onion marmalade, cornichon aioli - and served with house-cut fries. The fries were great! A bit less greasy version of those fantastic greasy kind of fries you get from a hot dog stand. Super good. As was the burger - the marmalade - and the cornichon aioli. Everything was perfect except...the bun! - Which was so bland and tough and flavorless, I tossed it to the side and knife and forked the burger.I'm sure, if I brought this detail to the staffs attention, they would have somehow taken care of things - they were nice that way. So I can only fault myself for not making an issue of it then. But man - compared to everything else - that was so great - that bun was a letdown. Regardless, I highly recommend Big Grove Tavern.",

He kept walking away before I got a chance to finish ordering everything and he didn't smile once. When I finally got my food, my medium burger was almost well done, the lettuce on the burger was so soggy it dripped off my burger, and the fries were so salty that they made my stomach hurt. I couldn't finish my burger or the fries and it was extremely overpriced. I would not recommend this restaurant unless you just go for drinks or the eggplant sandwich. You will pay too much and get less than mediocre, almost inedible food.",

When we were seated the waiter seemed like he didnt want to be there(i dont blame him but it was rude) and then when we were seated, we sat there for 20 minutes without being asked what we even wanted to drink. After that we still werent helped so we left. So that was our experience at big grove tavern!",

The food overall was bland.  We had the chili which was the best of what we ordered, the corn bread that came with it however, well, anyone could make something better tasting from a box mix.  The portabella mushroom sandwich was okay,  most of the flavor came from the butter, not sure what the cheese really was...., and the sweet potatoe chips again, we're okay.   Then came dessert. I am a sweet tooth fanatic, and I have very rarely not eaten a dessert, especially if it is chocolate based. The chocolate bread pudding looked chocolate, but had no chocolate, no sweetness, literally, no taste to it .  I kid you not. Not sure how that happens, but they seemed to master it here.  I see this place has really good reviews for dinner, so maybe it is just their Sunday brunch, but will probably not attempt to go back given the many other wonderful resturants in the area.",

I think I would have been embarrassed to charge that if I owned the place. 3) Mimosa was 3/4 OJ.  Again it all tasted really good so if you aren't worried about value then I'd recommend it.",

                "review": "I went here with my parents one night.  I love downtown Champaign, there are plenty of interesting and very good restaurants around.  Not to mention lots of very good beer bars.  This place tries to combine the two with a small but well constructed tap list and a small locally sourced menu.  My parents have been here a few times, and warned me of the downfalls (slow service, running out of menu items).  Well, I always have to check a new place out and see for myself.  After our visit, I had to apologize and thank them for humoring me.Anyway, a large open room with an island bar.  The light fixtures look like Christmas lights bought at Farm & Fleet.  The sticks on the ceiling look like they were bought at Hobby Lobby.We were seated right away, which was a good sign.  Though besides the fancy popcorn we were ignored for a long time.  I hate to be the person to say service was slow, cause it was a busy night.  I can deal with slow, but no acknowledgement what so ever was not good.  Incredibly slow kitchen times as well.We finally put our drink and food orders in at the same time.  We were not sure when we would get another chance.  I liked their beer selection.  8 taps of good micros.  Though they were out of four taps.  Half of their selection was out.  I like it when a place can go through kegs and rotate the selection, though no.  They would rather just not have half the selection.  Out of Great Lakes, out of Founders, out of Dark Horse, out of Victory.  I ended up with a Sculpin, and my Dad a Goose Island 312.  If you are going to have a small selection, you need to keep it stocked.The menu was similarly small, but looked good.  My Dad ended up with the last burger, which is a mix of beef, bison, and pork.  Sounds great.  He has tried to eat here before, twice actually.  Both times out of the burger, so it was good that he finally got to try it.   Again, it is good that they can go through the menu like that.  Though it is tiring when they keep running out.  I had the pork sausage, my Mom Mac & Cheese.  It is a tiny menu for dinner, about 5 main courses.  I love when a place can do that.  Just not enough here to pull that off.  Especially when they run out of stuff. On top of that, not much here was that great.  The burger was decent, Mac & Cheese cold, and the sausage was poorly executed with little flavor.  They shout from every corner that everything is fresh and local.  Fine, but make it good.This is one of my longest reviews, and I guess it is this way because I had very high hopes and little was as expected.  Though I was told before hand that everything was slow, over priced, pretentious, not that good, and often out.  This place just left me wanting so much more.",

I was pleasantly surprised how great the whole experience was.On Monday night they had a nice pre fixe menu for $50 with shared appetizer, soup/salad, entree, and shared dessert. Otherwise I could see dinner getting pricey here fast. We started with the Brussels sprouts which were lightly fried and not as oily as most fried sprouts. I could eat these all day.We tried a couple of deviled eggs and they fact that you can order them one apiece for $1 is nice if you just want a taste. Pretty standard, but tasty as most deviled eggs (to me) usually are. The cauliflower soup was nice as well. A bit plainer tasting than butternut squash soup, but I would still order it again with some toasted almonds. The steak entree was cooked perfectly though they never asked how I wanted it cooked. Glad they read my mind and got the medium rare cook correct. Root veggies were good too.I wasn't in love with the rice pudding, though it's not usually my thing. I didn't think it actually had rice in it...Though I don't get to Champaign too often, I would easily recommend it for someone looking for a good farm to table restaurant. Especially Mondays!",

The meat was highly overcooked, tough and chewy despite ordering it medium rare. My friend had a risotto, which just looked like mush on the plate. Both of our food came lukewarm. It was a quite busy night Im guessing, and the food sat out waiting to be taken - but any proper restaurant would manage better.When I went for lunch I had a steak sandwich - again with the toughness of the meat and a slightly stale bread this time, by the time I finished eating my jaw was sore, as if it had done some bench pressing.I'm giving 2 stars because of their poutine available on Friday and Saturday evenings after 9pm. It makes for amazing post-bars food, maybe since you are not really caring about quality as much....",

I have only tried the brunch once, but it was delicious and my whole family had a great time.  Loved the bloody mary's too.  The staff are incredible, possibly the best in town.  The servers know what they are doing and they do with elan, charm and a ready smile.  And everyone cares so deeply that the guests are having a great time.Lastly, I have been hanging out at Big Grove's beautiful bar (and I have learned that even the bar is \"local\" made by a local artisan) and it is becoming a truly cool after work watering hole.One word of advice, if you are planning on a Friday or Saturday dinner visit, you probably would be wise to make a reservation(which I did from their website via Opentable.com).  Easy to do. Try it.  You'll love it too.",

My friend got the chicken which was also really well put together and tasted great. While we were there, a Spanish mariachi band stopped by and played and that also really added to the fun atmosphere. The place was not overcrowded so it was really enjoyable to sit there for a while. The reason for the 4 stars is just based on the waitress we had, but the food was good and I would eat there again.",

                "review": "A solid two stars, yes!First of all, I'll say the taste of the food is pretty good.  The quality of the food and drink was above average.  The popcorn presented when we arrived was nicely flavored with spices, but came in a rather small tin.  We began with two cocktails which were delicious, but for the area, were either too small, or overpriced.  Thus began the battle of the perceptions in regards to overpriced versus tiny portions.We did not have appetizers because in my mind, they were a little pricey.  Deviled eggs for $1.00 each?  Ok, I get it, these are local eggs.  But half of an egg with a little mayo and some flavoring mixed into the yolk for $1.00?  Nope, still expensive.  Fries for $4.00?  Nope, not for this guy.  Besides, Illinois isn't know for their potato harvests.  $9.00 for a mixed greens salad?  How about make that salad plural and give us a couple of them for that price?Moving on, I wanted to try the famous \"Tavern Burger.\"  However, at 7:45 p.m., in a restaurant which wasn't packed out, they were out for the evening.  Really?  Hmmm, how strange.  You mean the cheapest choice for dinner, the one item which was mentioned in the newspaper and was considered your house specialty, and, worth mentioning again, your CHEAPEST dinner choice, was out so early?  How very strange...  I guess that meant I would have to choose a more expensive option. (And, incidentally, our server told us you made it fresh every day.  So, why didn't you just whip up a little more of the mix?  Or, does the bison truck come very morning?)We chose the Trout and the Pork Loin.  First, the portion sizes were tiny.  For the price of the trout, we expected at least half of a small trout for $18.00.  What we got was about 1/3 to  1/2 of a side of a small trout.   As for the pork, we received what amounted to about a 3 oz. portion.  Now, I understand it's local.  But, and I'm saying this as a consumer and a cook, pork is not expensive.  There is no grocery store in Champaign where you can go and find any cut of pork out pricing Beef.   And, the accompaniments, the turnips, chicory and cornbread were nice, tasty and well presented, were cool and not substantial.  The pork, for the price, should have been at least twice the size, and even this would have made the price extravagant.We shared a bottle of white wine from the menu, the wine selection being very good by the way, and also had dessert.  I had the Ice Cream Sandwich (which should have been slightly warmed so as to not have been served rock hard), and my guest had the Pot de Crme.  Both were delicious!Overall, I believe our bill totaled more than $140.00.  Can you believe it?  $140.00 for two cocktails, one bottle of white wine which retailed for about $13.00, two main dishes and two desserts.   Fine for Haute Cuisine, not fine for a tavern. We found the service to be just about perfect, as our server was attentive and respectful of both our needs and our privacy.The atmosphere is great in this place.  The food is good, but not great.  With the expanding options in the area, especially the great options across the street, there is little to nothing to draw me back to this establishment.",

                "review": "We went for an early Saturday night dinner, drawn in by new fine dining in the area (which is limited) and the promise of local farm to table style. We are huge fans of many local farm efforts, which can be sampled at the Common Ground Co-op and the Market at the Square on Saturdays at Lincoln Square Mall -- and now, Big Grove Tavern.First, the food, from a foodie perspective: Fresh product, well selected and well cared for. The flavors of the natural food are highlighted. The preparation is often minimally invasive. The technique is classic French. The flavor profile is quiet. My partner and I both wished for something a touch bolder. For example, the deviled eggs, a pre-starter, have yolks mixed with peas. We would suggest adding an acid note, perhaps a pickle. It was nice that they brought out flavored popcorn as a freebie with our drinks -- a feature at BGT. The flavor of the night was white truffle oil -- and you could taste the oil. That was a real win.For starters, my partner had the chili and cornbread, and I had the chicken liver pate with pickled onions and stewed rhubarb. I think mine was better -- really delicious, with rich, deeply flavorful pate contrasted against the rhubarb, which gave the bite the sweet and sour it needed to cut through. The farmstyle, whole grain bread had a wonderful crunch. The cornbread was a bit too refined -- it needed  more crust and less cake, more corn flavor and less cafe baked-good sweetness. The chili was savory, but mild--no real taste of chilis.The entree and dessert courses were both very good, especially dessert. My partner had the short ribs, which were beautifully medium rare -- not a hint over or under. I had the roast chicken with dumplings, which was amazingly good. Crisp skin, moist and flavorful meat, with a delicious herb broth under. Three dumplings that tasted like a delicate stuffing and had a satisfying bite. Slices of asparagus that also had a nice bite and a lovely green flavor still -- not at all cooked out. The portions seemed just right -- not too much and not too little.For dessert, my partner had the rhubarb crisp and i had the chocolate pot de creme. Both were really superb: refined, flavorful, rich, balanced. Nothing fussy -- just satisfaction in every bite, with very good coffee on the side (they use a medium blend from the Columbia Street Roastery -- a fine choice).The food is not bold. Or experimental. Or imaginative. But it is good, very good -- much better, I thought, in terms of technique than Carmon's Bistro.It's clear from the limited but well selected menu that the chef behind it is attempting to appeal to middlebrow Midwestern tastes, but doing it in such a quality way that I found it kind rather than condescending. People who don't necessarily like a chi-chi dining experience will enjoy the food, and those who do like fine dining will think it is predictable in its selections but well done nonetheless.Second, the decor and atmosphere: I generally like the blend of industrial and contemporary tavern that the interior designer seems to have been going for, although the dark colors dominate a little too much, despite the effort to add bits of fun in the lighting options. BGT has a chic, young vibe -- somewhere between casual and serious. Dark gray walls with a black drop tile ceiling, black wire-cage pendant lamps with industrial bulbs of different shapes (reminds me of the recent Restoration Hardware line), bleached branch chandeliers over the bar area, outdoor party-lights with clear exposed globe bulbs interlaced with raw blond planks (one off note: the planks have lumber-yard stamps, which may be a bit too low-end for what they were going for),  fairly inexpensive light-wood grain tables and nicely selected dark chairs--if a bit flimsy--and booth upholstery. I hope that over time BGT will invest in some better art pieces, and ones that bring more interest and warmth to the interior. There's seating outside too, if you're a smoker or don't mind getting it second hand.Third, cost: Yes, yes, it's on the expensive side. BGT is fine dining, not family dining. I won't be eating here every night either. Of course, any diner can make the meal more affordable by just sticking with an entree, rather than getting the whole shebang -- I'd guess for dinner that this would run you $20-25 tops. But if you have a deeper pocket that night, the whole shebang here could run you $100 with tip for two -- and you still won't feel cheated. The value is here, given the quality of experience.Fourth, service: BGT has a young, eager service staff. They took good care of us, and every other table I could see. From beginning to end, we enjoyed our time here.",

We went on a Monday and did the date night menu which I have enjoyed before. My boyfriend got the grits with pickled vegetables and said they were amazing. I got the pate and I could have eaten that everyday and not gotten sick of it, so good. I got the risotto and he got the filet, both equally tasty. His parents said their meals were great too. There was also a nice beer selection to choose from. The only problem I've ever had there was one of their mixed drinks tasted very funny to me. Overall, the food outweighs that though.",

I came in with a group of friends for lunch one day, and while the service was nice, the environment fine, the food was just completely underwhelming.I ordered the burger for lunch, with a side salad.  The burger was incredibly difficult to eat, and not due to excessive size, or the usual suspects.  I added an egg for 1.50, which turned out to be a mistake.  Although the flavors were OK, the bun just wasn't able to hand and got soggy, the burger decomposing as I ate it.  The proportions were off, and the lack of spectacular taste just made the meal messy with no upside.  The lettuce was completely wilted under the burger and the onions were entirely too sweet.Similarly, the salad was unfortunate.  Too much dressing and an overly generous hand of salt and citrus made the salad too salty and sour.For the entire meal, I paid $17 including tax and tip, which is OK for a downtown area.  However, I'd suggest that you check one of the other places around if you're looking for a solid burger.",

The chicken salad was absolutely flavorless, and there wasn't much of it. The bread was dry and tasteless. Moreover, the dish cost $9.00.  I hope the owners are reading these reviews, because the chicken salad sandwich is consistently getting bad reviews, and needs to be revamped or taken off the menu altogether.",

However, the bartender was at least friendly and the popcorn was fairly good, if not a little stale. I ordered a Tavern Burger which cost $12. The burger was alright; I always feel a bit jipped when a restaurant burger doesn't include tomatoes in it. It didn't help that they couldn't make two alcoholic beverages that my friend and I asked for. All in all, the hike up in the prices is paying for the atmosphere for the establishment.",

Entrees, we had the pork chops and the roasted chicken. What made both of these dishes great were the other flavors in the dish. So to me, it seemed like the chicken;pork was more of a \"side\" than the main highlight of the dish. Overall, the flavors were really nice, but it wasn't anything terribly special.I would give this a 3.5. I might try this one more time and get something new, but if my overall impression is the same, it'll be the last time.So far, I preferred the other place that used to be there.",

They weren't busy at all so it's not like she had other people to take care of. Her and the other employees were too busy talking with each other to have time to help any of the guests. When she would come over she wouldn't say more than 2 words to us and would leave as soon as possible. If we dared to ask her for anything she would just storm off and eventually come back with more water or popcorn since that is all we ever asked her to do. To top it all off, when we finished paying we were still talking and she came and got out receipt slips and read the tip amount! Of course she wasn't too happy since we tipped low based on how awful she was! But her doing that definitely justified to me why we tipped her low, that's for sure!Only reason I give 2 stars is because I liked the food. But it isn't worth going back to again if my friends and I will be treated poorly.",

Our server was really sweet and gave her opinion if we needed her help. I can't quite remember what I had because it was the special, but i thought it was delicious. It was two fried tortillas with black beans, rice, and salsa verde. It was topped with 2 fried eggs. Big Grove Tavern is not a place where you go just to \"have lunch\". It is a  place where you know you will get a good meal while feeling good about yourself because local farmers' produce is used in all steps of production.",

The menu looked very unique, flavorful and fun. However, none of the dishes blew me or my friends away. Everything was good and I appreciate how fresh the food was, but it all needed a little something more. The deviled eggs were awesome and so fun to order one at a time. Our wine was delicious and I appreciated their drink menu. The ambiance was cool as well. If I lived in Champaign I would go back, I just have a feeling that their meals are hit or miss.",

When we asked the bartender questions about the menu, he responded with an indifferent \"I don't usually work brunch\"...alrighty.  The food was delicious, but bordered on cold by the time it arrived. Bartender seemed to be tinkering around with menial tasks to avoid contact with customers.  After asking for the bill and producing a card, he walked away, forcing us to leave cash in order to get to the game.  It's gameday in Champaign, and we were decked out in Illini apparel...generally, servers know there's a game and will do their best to get you going.  I think in the future we will stick with Destihl, where service is always top-notch.",

We started with the tater tots and deviled eggs for appetizers. I loved the tater tots. They're not your typical frozen tots. They had some kind of apple puree sauce on the plate. Initially, I was skeptical, potato and apple together? It was delicious though. Holy cow. I really enjoyed that. I wish more than 4 came in an order though. The deviled eggs were nice, also. I really got a lot of the sweet pea flavor. It sounds odd but it was great and added a freshness to the egg. For dinner, several of us got the burger. Ohhhh my gosh. It was great. Cooked to the perfect temperature. It was a combo of bison, pork, and beef. The red onion marmalade on top was awesome. It added a sweetness and a lot of great flavor. A couple other people had the fried egg on top and they enjoyed it. The bun wasn't store bought and tasted homemade, very similar to what my husband bakes. It was nice to have a bun that doesn't disintegrate. The hand cut fries that came with the burger were the best fries I have had in years. Another friend INHALED the white fish. I didn't taste it but he said it was great. Someone else got the pork belly and kohlrabi gratin. She said it was great and was really happy with her choice. I wish I hadn't been at the opposite end of the table so I could have stolen a bite. It looked good. For a cocktail I had the Tavern Infusion. It was great and refreshing. There was a good selection of beer and wine, too. I stuck with one cocktail and water though. It was a nice touch when the owner came around to the tables and said hi and checked on us and other tables. She seemed really nice. Everyone at our table enjoyed the meal. We will definitely be back again, hopefully sooner than later.",

Like others before me have said, I definitely appreciate their fresh, simple approach that values quality ingredients and careful preparation.Several things hold me back from a full-throated endorsement, however.  First, the prices are steep.  The one reasonably priced entree item- the burger- frequently runs out.  I'm not sure if I just hit this place at the wrong time over and over, but I've only ordered it successfully once.  They know the demand is there, so why not have more? I understand that they don't want to freeze it, or whatever, but I've hit that place at 7 o'clock, and they're out of hamburgers.  It becomes apparent pretty quickly why there's no rush to increase their supply- because every other entree costs 5 dollars more. Secondly, the other (non-burger) entrees are small.  I rarely finish my plate at ANY restaurant, but here, it's no contest; I finish it all.  Last time, I ordered the mushroom risotto.  It was AMAZING.  I loved it!  But the size of it seemed like little more than a side dish.  My S.O. and I looked at each other at the end of the meal with our empty plates between us and I could tell we were thinking the same thing - I'm still so hungry!  Afterwards, we ended up going to Merry-Ann's around the corner for chili cheese fries (our adventure at that establishment is detailed in another review).Finally, service is hit or miss.  Last time, my S.O. ordered the special.  The server said that she wasn't sure they still had the special, so he went ahead and ordered a back-up entree in case (this was his idea, not hers).  She never came back to tell us what result.  The runner came out with our food, and of course, it was not the special, but the backup.  She was busy, but it would have been nice if she had just swung by and told us that they were indeed out of the special.  I think she might have been new, because her server-patter was also wanting. (She really didn't know what to say to us when she first approached the table.)  She also forgot my Patio Pounder (a great cocktail, BTW) until I reminded her, and I only got it once I was almost done with my entree.  I had water, so it was no big deal, but the overall experience (coupled with the bill at the end) quashed the overall good vibe of the place.Before I move, I do think I will go back and give it another shot.  Their date night menu looks like a good deal, and I'm really rooting for this place to be all it can be.",

I would have given this place 4 stars if not for the service, which has been some of the worst I have received in Champaign-Urbana.  More on this shortly.I love select dishes on the menu, but I feel like you have to know what to order.  The burgers are INCREDIBLE.  I never want to eat another burger that is not a mix of beef, bison, and pork.  Awesome.  And the fries with it are great!As much as I enjoy the burgers, there are times that you want some variety.  I know that it is trendy to include deviled eggs on a menu, but this are nothing special.  However, I feel like the pretzel makes up for this.  The pretzel is great and if you like your mustard with a HEAVY amount of spicy horseradish, this is for you!  I also really enjoyed the pork belly, but wish it was larger than just a starter.All of that being said, all of my recent experiences there have been a service disaster!  We have enjoyed going for the Friday outdoor concert series because we can sit outside and enjoy dinner, a beer, and the music.  In fact, until the service problems began we would go every week religiously.  Earlier in the summer the service was not a problem.  However, the past several times we have gone, we have literally had to BEG to be waited upon.  Each of these times, we have arrived, been seated, and then waited for 20-30 minutes before any server came to our table to even take a drink order.  We have had to ask the hostess or manager, some times several times in the same meal, to have one of the wait staff come to our table just to take an order.  The last straw was when the same friend was there for TWO DIFFERENT MEALS IN A ROW (seated at an entirely different table) and she too was talking with the management to try and get someone to take our order.The paranoid person in me worries that this lack of service is because we came with a small child.  Our child is quite well-behaved in a restaurant, but we try to be courteous and go for very early dinners when we know she will not be a problem.  We always try to order the full meal (drinks, dinner, dessert) up front and ask that the bill be given to us when the drinks arrive so we can make a quick get-away if necessary.  My point is that this is the one time that we actually get to go out and enjoy an adult meal and activity and I don't want it regularly spoiled by bad (or nonexistent) service, regardless of whether or not it is because I have a child with me.  I have wasted this time for several weeks in a row at Big Grove and don't plan on doing so again for a long time.  There are plenty of other options in the area.",

                "review": "Thank god for this place. That's really all I can say. Well no, I can say more. But before I get to the meat of my review, no pun intended, let me say that Big Grove Tavern is exactly what this town needed. When Jim Gould's closed I was sad to see it go but what has come in it's place is something really fantastic. From the food to the interior to the crowd, the energy Big Grove gives off is infectious and demonstrates that the confluence of intellect and small-town charm in Champaign can really lead to something amazing.Now on to the food:Popcorn: Come for free as a starter. While I was hoping for bread, I was even happier with this. The popcorn really whets your appetite without being too filling. I hear the flavor changes; it was definitely some kind of lime (think the hint of lime you find certain Mexican foods) flavor when I was there.Tavern Burger: There are so many things I can say about the Tavern Burger. First and most simply, it's delicious. The blend of bison was for me, the most prominent of the three meats that make up the burger but overall I found it to be rich, meaty and just the right amount of gamey given the bison. The onion marmalade, and petite crusty bun complimented the burger without overpowering the taste of the meat. I opted to add the fried egg which led to messy experience given the soft yolk, but a certainly more delicious one. At this point, if I did this right, you are so convinced about the deliciousness of the burger you won't even care to hear about the fries. But hey, if you're still interested: they're completely well-executed- crisp yet still potatoey. Now... onto my other comment on the Tavern Burger. There was some review on here about how the burger is in limited quantities. That's how you know it's fresh and locally sourced! If I wanted something from a freezer I'd head down by the mall and swallow some hormone-laced, bacon-cheese-blue cheese-fried onion-black forest-ham-ranch dressing-heart attack in a bun. If you want a burger that satisfies your burger craving while still being an appreciable entree and cut of meat, come enjoy the Tavern Burger. And if you've missed it, just come back and try again! And frankly, at 12 bucks, it's not that bad. The downtown Champaign restaurant scene generally errs on the more expensive side. Given what Jim Gould's prices used to be like, Big Grove is far more reasonable price-wise in comparison. In sum, ignore the hate, embrace the love, Big Grove will have you leaving full, happy and pleasantly surprised by what Champaign has to offer food-wise.",

                "review": "I was glad to see something young and fresh in place of Jim Gould. Gould was boring and dated, but the only option we had in the C-U if you wanted to go to a \"nice\" restaurant. Big Grove Tavern has a casual updated atmosphere with an original concept for the C-U (farm to table). We wanted to go to Destihl (right across from Big Grove) yesterday for lunch,  but there was a wait and we couldn't wait. We finally had a chance to try Big Grove. There was no wait, and we were seated right away. We were with our 2.5 year old, and  we have never gone to a kid restaurant. Our daughter is used to dining in grown up restaurants with grown ups, but even the most patient of young foodies could use a quiet distraction while they wait.  Destihl is not a kids' restaurant, but they have a variety of foods to choose from on the kids' menu and they give the kids crayons to color on the kids' menu. Smart and simple concept that works well. The server at Big Grove said they do not have a kids' menu, but they have \"kid friendly\" options. All they had was grilled cheese and sweet potato fries. I asked if we could just get regular potato fries and the server said \"yes\" so that is what my daughter got. I never understood the whole trend of replacing delicious french fries with sweet potato fries--they don't taste better nor are they \"healthier\" or much lower in calories. If you are going to eat fries make them from potatoes not sweet potatoes. I wanted to order a burger, but all their burger options are a blend of beef, bison and pork and I don't want to eat bison so I ordered the Black Bean Burger.  My husband ordered \"The Baltimore\"which is basically a BLT with avocados. My daughter's fries had more salt than there is in salt. Maybe it was just that day, but someone went really heavy handed with the salt. My Black Bean Burger was really good. It's not what I wanted to eat, but if you are vegetarian (I have been on and off for years) this was delicious. My husband's order was okay. It's a BLT with avocado. Why take a classic and add something that adds nothing? The server was great--very nice person and efficient. The design and layout of the restaurant is great. Casual and open. Trying to be a gastropub, but misses the mark with the menu. It's still a big step up for the C-U in terms of dining options. I liked this place. I like the concept, the layout, the service, but the menu is not for me. The food is not bad, but not great. Too many options like a classic burger or BLT are turned into things that are trying too hard to be \"cheffie\", but miss the mark. I just wish they didn't try to reinvent the wheel on these American food classics. If they're going to reinvent the classics they better make them better than the original. I would have liked to see a few classics taken up a notch with a gourmet twist or just a few classics done really well. Overall Big Grove is worth a try, but I wouldn't highly recommend it or anything because the food options are limited and the food tastes okay. Not great, just okay.",

                "review": "Went for lunch last week...maybe the chef has changed since the soft opening as I found nothing overwhelming about the menu and would agree with one reviewer who described it as expensive and limited. I ordered a chicken salad sandwich and it was described as coming with mixed greens since I'd rather have that than sweet potato chips and there was no salad when I got my sandwich. When I asked the waitress she said my salad was on my sandwich...which did have a piece of lettuce on the bottom. Besides that my sandwich was very dry and tasteless. My lunch mate wanted a cup of chili and was told emphatically they only had bowls but when it arrived it was the smallest cup of chili I have seen and for 7$?  The cornbread was bigger than the cupAnother person in the party had the burger.  The 12$ burger. When it arrived it looked like a slider.  I do think he said it was good, but there are far better burger for a better price than 12$.Our bill for lunch for 4 was 70$. Way too expensive for lunch. Even a NYC lunch but the food was not worth it at all.  On the way out a couple diners seated next to us said they couldn't wait to get on their Facebook accounts to let people know how bad this place is. And we agree. I give this place 6 months. Save your money and go to destihl or any other burger joint for better food",

                "review": "This came very well reviewed on Yelp and Open table. Hey! Its a Tavern! How bad could it be? I was wrong...I was down in the U of I area during homecoming and made a reservation just in case it was packed for an early dinner. When we arrived, the place was empty. We were taken to our table and given this small one page menu. I thought it was the drink menu, but no, it was the dinner menu. A bit suprised, I asked my father if he would rather go to DESTIL across the street, but he wanted to try this new local joint. We decided that I was going to get the \"famous\" burger and my dad was going to get the Mac and Cheese. Our server came over and my dad started by ordering the Mac and Cheese, but he asked if he could get it without the onions (shallots and leeks). He was told NO because they already have it premixed. Premixed? She assured him that there was not alot of onions so we continued. For $12 on the burger and $14 for the Mac and Cheese, we were expecting something spectacular. My burger came out. It was a mix of bison, beef, and pork. I was expecting something very flavorful. It was bland as could be. Also, it was about 1/8 of a pound. One of the smallest burgers I have ever eaten. The fries that came with this was good, but the dish was not worth it. My dad's Mac and Cheese came out in a small bowl and half of it was made up of shallots and leeks. I tasted it and thought that it was good, but he HATED it. We had the manager called over and he took it away and took it off of the bill without us asking. He asked if we wanted something else, but my dad complained that the menu was too small for him to go with anything else. Instead of apologizing, the manager told him \"well its all local\" and he walked away. Our server was nice, but I could overhear the hostess and the manager talking about future reservations for the night with an attitude and snarky responses to each other. People can hear you folks!  It was as if they were doing us a favor by being open. In short, skip this place and go to other places within a block of this place. They know how to treat their customers and not to overcharge. I would suggest Guido's!",

Everything blended together perfectly... A medley of flavor so irresistible it has me drooling and wishing I could come back for more. You can trust me on this. I like food. A lot. But this burger changed my life. Buy the Tavern Burger. You won't regret it. One thing I would say: their definition of how well the meat is done is different than most, it is much less cooked than what a usual burger would be. Probably rule of thumb would be to order up from what you usually get if you don't like or are picky about how pink your meat is. i.e. If you're like me and like your burger \"medium rare\" order \"medium\" if you really don't like your meat any more pink than what you are used to. I would highly recommend this restaurant to all people looking for an exceptional and creative meal.",

There were 5 entrees, and I didn't think any of them stood out.  My husband ordered the Tavern burger (beef, Bison, and pork) and I ordered the Grilled Cheese because it was the only thing besides the burger that I thought I might like and it was only $8.  We each got a deviled egg ($1 each) and they were good, a little on the salty side though.  We also enjoyed the small bucket of popcorn you get for free.  Hubby's burger came with a huge pile of fries (good because the burger is $12, cheese is $1.50 extra) and I got a mixed green salad with my grilled cheese.  The vinaigrette on the salad was a bit salty as well.  The food was okay, the service was great, I like the fact that everything is locally sourced.  We might be back for dinner sometime, but we'll see...it's very expensive.",

I had the falafel, which was a tad dry, but it's falafel, and this is easy to screw up - forgivable.  The other dishes were great.  Excellent turkey sandwich, though the sourdough is a bit airy for my tastes.  A traditional sourdough needs some ... sourness and doughiness - this really does taste like airy French or Italian bread. The saged popcorn is a nice touch, but I have been here about seven times, and it is always saged popcorn, and the server consistently says \"Our popcorn -today- is fried sage\". ... which to me implies that this will change once in a while.  In my experience, it does not. Finally, and this has been said *dozens* of times here.  The prices are completely out of line with Champaign.  I can get locally sourced ingredients to create a Turkey sandwich and mixed green salad at the local grocery, and a 10oz bottle of the same beer.  Grand total will be well under $20 with a full six pack and ingredients to spare. My damage for lunch?  $23 after a modest tip.  The following day I had a (good) soup of Yellow Beet root and mixed green salad.  To be clear, we are talking about a CUP of soup and a small plate of salad, for $18. Completely out of touch with the local area and absolutely haranguing customers on the guise of farm-to-table.  Want to like it based on the food, can't stand to be here based on the price.

Good atmosphere, good service, good beer.Full review:Based on my two trips to the Big Grove, it seems to be hit or miss.The first time I went, around January of 2014, I was extremely impressed. I had pork belly as an appetizer (amazing) with a Dogfish Head 90 minute to chase it down (the beer selection is pretty great). For dinner, I had a perfectly cooked steak (don't remember the cut), served alongside gnocchi. Everything I ate was relatively simple, but they executed perfectly on the local, farm to table ingredients (they're proud of that here). Service was fantastic.The second time I went, in July 2014, the food was very disappointing. The steak was solid again, but it was served alongside one of the most bitter, poorly cooked broccolini I've ever had the displeasure of tasting. The pork tendorloin was chewy, definitely do not recommend. And this time, the pork belly appetizer was served differently, as a salad. I think it's pretty difficult to screw up pork belly, but they managed to do so. It tasted as if it were cooked a day ago, and it was difficult to find much pork belly beneath the greens. Service was tremendous on both occasions. Our water and popcorn (the popcorn is great) were refilled consistently, and the waiter seemed to take pride in the food.",

The restaurant is very inviting and rather large. I love the clean feeling and the hardwood floors. We were seated in the front of the restaurant right near windows for people watching, loved that. There are these cute containers of popcorn on the table. The popcorn is salty, but sweet, nice touch! I checked in on foursquare and got a free deviled egg! The deviled egg was very tasty and different than anything I've ever had.. The egg with the combination of cabbage was tasty! The beer menu was pretty big, which we liked. Unfortunately, we were told right away that they were out of the bison burger, which is one of the reasons we chose this place, so that was very disapointing. I ordered the Mac and Cheese and hubby ordered the steak that came with potatoes and veggies, well done. We had a couple rounds of drinks and our food came. My mac and cheese was good, but a bit dry because of the amount of bread crumbs. I feel like the bread crumbs needed to have more butter or moisture. The cheeses and bacon made this macaroni and cheese pretty good. It isn't something I'd order again for $14, but I liked it. My husbands steak, seemed awfully small for a $20 meal. Probably about 4 oz of meat. Plus, it was cooked more medium than medium well. The sides on the plate were pretty good. Overall, the place was nice, but a bit overpriced for the portions.",

During graduation weekend I attempted to make reservations for 10 (I know...bad idea!) and was told that they were only taking reservations for 8, which I understood, but the hostess proceeded to tell me that if more than 8 showed up she would be obliged to charge my credit card. I didn't argue over the 8 person rule, so why would that be her response?! On a separate occasion I've had my reservation lost which led to a 30 minute wait.  The food: the deviled eggs are always a delight and the drinks are above average. I find the entrees to be a hit or miss as they can sometimes be too salty but the burger is always a solid bet.",

I usually don't like the taste of anise, but this was really good, and we got free refills without asking.We ordered a vegetarian ragout (creamy with a hint of spiciness), the burger (it's big burger a unique taste from the mix of beef, pork, and bison), the pork shoulder (cooked perfectly), and the pork sausage (after the waitress checked on us, we discovered the root vegetables weren't cooked well enough; the dinner is on a low-carb diet and wasn't going to eat them anyway, but the waitress was very receptive when we mentioned it later). Also two beers--I can't remember which. We didn't have room for dessert, but if it's still on the menu, I want to try the spiced pumpkin bread pudding. Hello? Heaven is calling...Pros: good, local food; great staff; reasonable prices at the \"expensive for a college student\" level (c. $15 per entree)Cons: dim lighting + aging eyes + small print on the drink menu = squintingnoise level --All too often it seems that chic decor and sound-proofing are non-intersecting circles of restaurant interior design.

The Seared Pork Belly was totally decadent- buttery, full of umami flavor and perfectly crisp on the outside. Mom got the Faroe Islands Salmon, which was excellently cooked, though the lentils were a touch under-salted. We shared the Apple and Pear Crisp for dessert, which was delicious as well, but my entree really won the night.I ordered the Roasted Mushroom and Poached Farm Egg. I'd originally planned on the Mac n Cheese, but our waitress persuaded me to give the egg dish a shot, and I am so incredibly happy I did. The egg was poached impeccably, and when the yolk broke over those grits, I nearly wept. Everything about it, from concept to execution, was excellent. The grits were rich and creamy, the mushrooms were delightfully earthy and tender, and whatever they did to that sauce was magical.

First off, I love farm-to-table restaurants and Big Grove Tavern does a really great job of utilizing local and regional farms. One of my favorite parts of the restaurant is a large map displayed on their wall that pinpoints where each of their ingredients comes from - how awesome is that! When it comes to the restaurant's atmosphere, it's trendy mix of both contemporary and rustic chic. The ceilings are lit with old-fashioned string lights and vintage lightbulbs, and hanging above the bar are driftwood chandeliers. After flipping through the clipboard dinner menu, I decided on the free-range roasted chicken with herb dumplings, green beans, shiitake mushrooms, and fingerling potatoes. The portion size is good, but the flavor was not anything spectacular. The chicken was juicy, but the rest of the dish was undercooked - especially the green beans and fingerling potatoes. All in all, this average tasting dinner dish was not worth $19. For dessert I decided on the girl scout thin mint brownie sundae, complete with mint ice-cream, brownies, chocolate ganache, and sprinkled with peppermint candy (I mean come on, who doesn't love thin mints?) It may have been served in a glass goblet, but unfortunately my expectations of this dessert were much too high. The brownie and ice-cream were good, but the whole dish was overloaded with crushed peppermint candy - it ruined the flavor of the rest of the dessert! I would not recommend wasting $7 on this glorified sundae. Next time I'm in Champaign, I'll be trying out another restaurant in hopes of getting my money's worth.",

Definitely my scene.Started with their fried brussels sprouts (also a trendy food item on top of the trendy decor! theme??) with tuffle aioli and sea salt and nothing like a little sea salt to push a dish over! These things were addicting. I shared a little, but not much! Gotta love some good brussel sprouts. I still don't get why kids hate these things so much???Then since I ate vegetables to start like a good kid (I know, yes they were fried, but come on, let me have my cake and it too, okay?), I thought that granted me the ability to get their mac and cheese in a little oven baked dish packed with tons of cheese, bacon, leeks, fried shallots, and then as it should be, topped with crumbled bread crumbs! Mmmmmm that mac and cheese was exactly how I like my mac and cheese! Hot, creamy, cheesy, goodness. Done and done. Plus they had a good beer selection here too, the only thing I think that was missing was more attentive service since I would have ordered more beer if they had come around more quickly and the water service, but pretty minor! I definitely would come back here if I visited again!",

Since that initial visit, I have now tried their chicken and dumplings and the skirt steak. The chicken was lovely, moist and well seasoned, the dumplings, however, were a bit of a downer--they were SALTY, small, and sparse, nothing exciting. I might try the dish again, but will have to ask them to be mindful of their salt. The skirt steak was cooked as requested (medium) and was surprisingly tender. I think that they change the accompanying veggies seasonally, but it's always served with a chimichurri (sauce). Given that chimi is one of my favorite sauces, I'll admit that I was skeptical of trying it in Champaign, and was pleasantly surprised--the downfall, they serve it as decorative dots on the plate, rather than a sauce for the meat so there's hardly any of it to enjoy! As you can see, my review of the food has much improved since my first post. I still think that it is overpriced for the portions and location (come on it's Champaign!). My last waitress was pretty good--so service also seems to have improved (or I might've just been lucky).",

After being seated the waitress came within 5 minutes and took our drinks.. 2 lemonades and a Moscow Mule..lemonades came quickly..20+ minutes for the Mule. 20+ minutes later our order was taken...over 40 minutes later we received our food. I was accompanied by my son and 3 year old granddaughter celebrating her birthday.  Items ordered were the flank steak, mac and cheese and kids menu (only 2 items to choose from) chicken tenders.  The food was good but not great. We also ordered ice cream for my granddaughter's birthday and a sweet potato cake that was dry and had a weird after taste.  Our bill came to $80 FRICKN dollars!!! Way way over priced!! This reminds me of Jim Goulds that went out of business for this reason!!I agree with previous reviews that they are trying too much to be different and have Chicago or New York prices. In conclusion, we were there for over 90 minutes (with a 3 year old), food was good but not great and extremely over priced..will not return as there are many better options in Champaign-Urbana.",

Although the portion sizes seemed a bit off (the carb to main item ratio seemed a bit off for both my friend and my dishes) the food was flavorful and the desserts (vanilla ice cream and the olive oil cake) were delicious and worth sticking around for.

It was superb when paired with the pickled pepper relish.  I almost went with the Seared Walleye, but decided to indulge on a burger with my bf instead.  I've never had a combination of beef, bison, and pork.  Both were cooked to a perfect medium.  However, he ordered his with the additions Amish white cheddar and a fried egg, with the marmalade and aioli on the side.  I ordered mine with everything and a fried egg.  The red onion marmalade was amazing!  I was eating my fries with the bf's side portion.  Next time, I'm asking for extra!  It was so messy, but well worth the lean-in at the bar.  I almost forgot!

Alas, it is not to be.In spite of many available tables, we were seated in a dark and cavernous (all in black) alcove.  Although elsewhere it was the bright light of day, we were barely able to make out the menu in the darkness.  We ordered wine by the glass to start; they waved the bottle over the glass and delivered a very small quantity for a full price pour.  Actually, I like the option of small-glass, but only if they offer the option of paying accordingly...I've had larger pours at free wine tastings around town.  Illinois is beer country, and as they are going local perhaps we would have been better to order a local brew.We waited a long time for our food, allowing our meager splash of wine to warm in the glass so as to save the few swallows to have with our meal.  At long last when it arrived, the spouse's was pleasant enough but mine was not at all as described.  I had ordered the chicken salad on wheat bread with greens; one of the few sandwiches that did not say it was served with chips. All flavors were erased by a thick layer of Dijon mustard and it was served on very dried out toast with chips on the side.  The \"greens\" were a piece of lettuce inserted between the mass of mustard and the dried out bread.  The person at the next table ordered the same dish and had the same impression, asking the waitress where the greens were and commenting on the dried out toast. It was supposed to have tarragon and other interesting ingredients, but every flavor was eclipsed by the strong Dijon mustard.Don't know if it was the worst lunch I had since moving here last summer, but it was clearly the most expensive bad lunch I have had, approaching $50 for two sandwiches--one nearly inedible--and a smidgeon of wine. This was very expensive for mixed quality, not a good value.Pluses: I like that they are trying to source from local farms, although I missed having a fish or seafood option on the menu.  The staff was very friendly. Minuses: Expensive, very small portions, descriptions on menu not accurate, food quality uneven, some bad seating locations.  I gave it two stars for the effort to source locally and the friendliness of the staff.  I a willing to give them a try again in a couple of months to see if they iron out the kinks, but only if I am feeling extravagant.",

Also, there are little details like the cumbersome menus and the weirdly-high tables that leave me feeling like the experience wasn't quite worth of five stars.

But what runs a restaurant is the food, and we gave it plenty of tries.In January we were in for a date night on the weekend and we told they had oysters! Oh how we miss them. The server seemed pretty confused on how they came, what they were and what sauce came with it, so we went ahead and gave it shot. How can you mess up an oyster, right? Well, good god this was so disgusting! The oysters were on ice, but filled to the brim with this gross creamy orange liquid that was tepid and just...GROSS! It totally covered the whole flavor of the oyster and was absolutely a disgrace to the beauty that's an oyster. So tepid sauce and somewhat cold oyster - feels like a temperature danger zone to me. So again, I'm thinking, the chef is from SF and she does that to an oyster?! Yikes. We then decided to not order dinner because of those oysters (and didn't want to seem like cheapskates) and got the chocolate budino. That dessert is supposed to be pudding-like, but was SO hard and impossible to put a spoon, knife and fork in. So we sat and waited for it to get a little softer, but it was more like a little jar of chocolate that was melted and then refrigerated back into a chocolate bar. That was in no way rich and creamy and custard-like. I would call it \"Chocolate Brick In A Cute Mason Jar\".Came back again and had Sunday brunch as there are limited options in Champaign-Urbana. I ordered the chicken hash and my partner got the huevos rancheros...I think. My chicken hash was full of those bits of chewy cartilage-like chicken that you would, ya know, throw away! Not one piece was edible chicken. I felt absolutely jipped and told the server who didn't seem to care or knew what to do? And the scone we got was just a rock hard lump of dough over baked. I mean you could use that thing as a weapon, lol. So depressing for such a beautiful restaurant and concept. :-/As some have said in their reviews, too: the food is nothing extraordinary. Honestly, for each of our experiences it was pretty gross and I couldn't tell if we came in on off times or what, but not impressed at all. Yuck.",

I looked at both menus, and frankly, because big grove was second, I stayed there. I opted to sit outside, in the sun. It was not bad at all.Onto the  experience... first of all, my waitress was great and very attentive. Each table gets a little bowl of popcorn to start, which is cool. Anyways, their menu is locally sourced, and quite small. They have a few appetizers, and I indulged in two of them. I had a deviled egg (dollar per), and I also ordered the pickled vegetables (radish, onion, fennel, and carrot). The deviled egg came with a rye crisp and sauteed red onions. It was okay, and I'm glad I only ordered one. On the other hand, the pickled vegetables were fantastic! A little pricey at 3 dollars, but definitely the highlight of my meal.For my main course, I ordered the pork, bison, and beef burger. I had the aioli and red onion marmelade on the side. I like my burgers medium. I also ordered mine on whole grain bread instead of the standard bun.The burger was average. It was not cooked medium well, and there was some yellow sauce (not the aioli, but possibly a mustard) that ended up on my burger, even though I asked for my burger plain. My mixed greens salad with the vinagrette was good. My second favorite part, and I'm not a salad fan at all.Overall, a decent place. Nothing special. My bill was 17 dollars, and I did not order a drink or anything. I like the feel of the restaurant, but honestly, I'll probably go somewhere else in the area before I head back here.",

For dinner we tried 4 of the 6 starters and all I have to say is that the hash browns were excellent and I could probably eat the pickled veggies every day and never tire of them. The Pate is a must try and the deviled eggs are just perfect. We tried 4 of the soups/salads and while I was not a fan of the seared pork belly, others at the table thought it was very good but the cheesy grits on the bottom were amazing. The cornbread was delightful (almost as good as Black Dog) and the chili just right. I look forward to trying the other items. The entrees were a great size and very well done. I had the pan seared fish which was perfectly cooked and had a side of pickled veggies. The cornbread stuffing on another plate was so good. The chicken was very tasty. The steak was cooked to a great temp. We also had the mac and cheese, they seem to understand that people like cheese and bacon because this dish did not disappoint. I plan on going for dinner many times. For lunch we were disappointed that the burger had already run out but we will have to go back earlier to try it. The steak sandwich was very good but the star on that plate was the Sweet Potato Chips, they were absolutely delicious. The horseshoe was very good and I especially enjoyed the sauce. I will be heading over there again for lunch very soon.This place is a great addition to downtown Champaign and a great replacement to Jim Gould's. The decor is very well suited to the atmosphere the place is trying to convey. I love that they expanded the bar. The prices are a bit high compared to some of the other places downtown but the food is of such a great quality that it is well worth the price.My biggest disappointment is that I am always too full to try the desserts because they look very good.",

                "review": "I have been to Big Grove a few times, with mixed results, but lunch today will be my last visit. Service:When we arrived, the restaurant was less than half full. Our server's name was Daniel. My friend and I ordered Chili Cheese Fries as an appetizer (I specified that we wanted it out first) and two sandwiches as the main course. About twenty minutes passed and our sandwiches came out, carried by a different server. I asked him about our appetizer and he had no idea. He found our server at the wait station, who then came over and without any apology told us that the kitchen had messed up our tickets. He returned with the app a minute later and mumbled something about the Chili Cheese Fries taking longer on average than the Cuban sandwich which I had ordered. The Cheese Fries were soggy and lukewarm. First of all, I absolutely hate it when a server blames the kitchen. It is so petty, and makes the whole restaurant look bad, especially at a place which supposedly prides itself on it's chef-driven sensibilities. Next, there is no way that a plate of chili fries takes longer than a Cuban sandwich. It was clear to me that the appetizer had sat in the window way too long, which is why it was tepid and soggy. This tells me that our app was finished by the kitchen in good time, and then just sat there until after our sandwiches had already been ran. No point having a chef in the kitchen if the food dies in the window. Even if the kitchen did screw up, which I highly doubt, the server is responsible for taking care of us and smoothing it over. Throwing the kitchen under the bus is a pathetic excuse. I cannot stand a person who won't take accountability for the mistakes. Next: Halfway through my sandwich, I decided to order a second beer, as the draught list there is excellent. Not only did our server fail to offer me a refill, but I COULD NOT get his attention. I spent over ten minutes waving my hands, trying to get him to our table. I'm going to repeat that this place was far from busy. I watched him bus tables, have personal conversations with other staff, and generally ignore us. I ended up flagging down the second server who ran our food, who took my order to Daniel (who was standing at the bar talking to staff.) After another five minutes, he managed to produce my order. Completely unsatisfactory. Fifteen minutes to order and receive a beer during a slow lunch is unbelievable. At this point, we had been seated for almost an hour. Daniel then dropped the check and returned our receipt with no kind words, apology, or gratitude for coming. We did not feel welcomed or taken care of at all. Simply some of the worst service I've had in CU. Food:Chili Cheese Fries would have been tasty had they been hot and fresh. No one likes soggy fries. Inattention ruined that dish. My Cuban was shy on meat and priced at $12. Destihl, right across the street, also offers a Cuban sandwich with way more meat priced at $10. The flavor with Grove's version was good, but the value sucked. My friend enjoyed her Grilled Cheese. Conclusion:  After a half-dozen visits over the last 18 months, both for lunch and dinner, we have not had one satisfactory meal, due to sub-par service.  There is no point sourcing your produce and protein from local farms if the kitchen is sabotaged by terrible service and high price-points. Over-hyped and not worth the money. This place is all hat and no cattle. We will not return and will tell everyone we know to avoid it.",

We had a watered down old fashioned once, but other than that one experiences, the drinks have been interesting and tasty.*Good, friendly service.  Sometimes it is a little slow, but servers are always friendly and do their best for you.The So-So: *menu tends towards fancified home cooking, which is not a bad thing.  But given that, it seems a bit overpriced for what you get.  The food we've had as been consistently okay, but not amazing.  Dinner?  Okay.  Brunch (which I really, really wanted to love)?  Again, just okay.  If you don't cook a lot at home, this can be a great place for you.  If you are a successful and inventive home cook, you might not be as impressed.  Con:**This is the thing that makes me not want to give Big Grove another chance.  We were in about 6 months ago (August), and both ordered the burger.  We requested some tomato to go with it, and the waitress came back- somewhat sheepishly, to her credit- and told us that the kitchen didn't serve it with tomato.  Okay.  I've been to fine dining restaurants, and I understand that chefs conceptualize the flavors of a dish in a particular way, and that's the way they want you to experience it.  But a burger?  And, more importantly, this burger?  It's fine, but it's not all that.  Perhaps they were just out of tomatoes?  But anyway, the fact that they were so proud of this burger keeps gnawing at me.  Overall:*Good drinks, fine ambience, good service.  In the greater scheme of things, they are still fairly new, so maybe they'll continue to evolve?  I hope so, because I'd love to see them reach a little bit higher; there seems to be potential for more here.",

This place takes both reservation and walk-ins, which was very helpful during graduation weekend when all the restaurants are packed.First impression: the place is trendy - you can sit in the bar area, tables, booth, or even outside during the summer. During brunch people come in their sweatshirt and sweatpants, but the dinner crowd is more well-dressed. I had a good experience with the service everytime I go to this place. They serve you popcorn with spices of the day as a complementary snack.Dinner:I came here with my vegetarian friend so all the items we ordered from the menu is vegetarian!- Devilled eggs: delicious, but not dying for it- Chilled roasted beets: very very delicious - I honestly prefer the beets to the devilled eggs for appetizer- Roasted sunchoke risotto: Errr... It's just ok. I've had better risotto before. I think it's a little bland- Veggie mac and cheese: Also just ok. Among all 4 items we order, I like the beets the most!Brunch:To be fair, I've been ordering the same thing over and over again: CHILAQUILES. My mouth is literally watering as I am writing this. It is absolutely heavenly!!! The tortilla is well covered in spices and it is between crunchy and soft corn tortillas. The shredded chicken is so soft and it melts in my mouth! MUST TRY! The portion is very generous I usually can't finish the whole plate in one meal.My boyfriend had the eggs benedict before and he said it was good, but it's something you can find anywhere!Did I mention they have good selection of cocktails? LOVE THE BLOODY MARY!! Overall I give 3 stars for the dinner and 5 for the brunch and thus 4 stars!! It's also a good place to chill and drink on sat/ Friday night.",

I did not get the Aioli on my burger.  It was DELICIOUS!  for me the fried egg made this burger one of, if not THE best in Champaign/Urbana.  And i've had what is considered to be in the top 5 in america at Kuma's Corner in Chicago, its not that good, or that big, but its plenty excellent.  the house cut fries were very good too, i loved the seasoning.my wife raved about the Beer Brined Pork Loin, saying it was \"delicious\".  The place is a little pricy, but they also have very close attention to detail and the food is all from local area suppliers, which is a nice touch and compliment to the local growers.I will be back again at this restaurant, i can't wait to try the BLT with the egg at lunch next!",

We got in at 4:30 and the server informed us we couldn't order dinner until 5, so we got a table and dissected the menu for ~30 minutes, ordered some drinks, and a bar snack or two.We opted to sit outside on a beautiful Sunday evening. Though I must mention the inside of Big Grove has a cool ambiance. Very dark/modern types of colors with some interesting tree/woodwork stuff hanging from the ceiling.Wine by the glass happened to be half off that evening, which was a pleasant surprise. I had a smoother French one which I forget the name of and my mother had a French Malbec, I tried to look them up online when I got home but it seems their wine list isn't 100% up to date online. Dad opted for a beer, the Left Hand Milk Stout Nitro, which ironically my roommate just ordered last weekend at Black Dog! He really enjoyed it but thought it wasn't served cold enough. No frosty glass, kind of a turn off for my Pops....We started with the deviled eggs and hushpuppies. The eggs were just OK and I thought the hush puppies were pretty tasty, especially with the sauce they came with! My mother said they were just fair.For dinner, my Uncle got the Free-Range chicken which he liked a lot. He particularly enjoyed the chicken jus as well as the dumplings that came with it. Mom and Dad split the short ribs, which they both thought were exceptional, and believe me, my mother is highly critical of short ribs, since she can cook up some mighty fine ones herself. I can verify via taste that these were not your average short ribs, I'd highly recommend these. On a last second split decision between the skirt steak and the pork tenderloin, I opted for the latter. This was also a really well put together dish that came with carrots, endive, and these glorious sweet potato hash brown patty things. The pork itself was done a perfect medium-rare and was flavorful, juicy and overall a nicely executed plate that would not have been the same without the creamy mustard sauce it was all sitting on.We did have some qualms which would have normally warranted only a 3 star review if it wasn't for how well everyone enjoyed their entrees. The beer I mentioned above could definitely have been served colder. Our server didn't seem to take the hint when my dad mentioned he liked frosty glasses. Our other major qualm would be the price to portion ratio. My parents split the short ribs and when they were finished they were still kind of hungry. Be warned, if you want to be at least a little full, don't share an entre, the portions are pretty small. The place is also comparably expensive, all of these entrees nearly required a $20 bill or more. We thought the clipboard menus were a little tacky for a place of this caliber.I do like the farm-to-table concept, I also really admire and respect Big Grove's local sourcing of foods. My only constructive criticism would be to actually put where each dish comes from on the menu, such as:\"Grilled Pork Tenderloin - Farm XYZ: _____, IL\".As an avid organic and local food fan, adding this type of notation makes me feel much better than simply, \"local\". Common Ground Co-Op in Urbana does a fairly good job of  this.Overall, a very pleasant dinner on a gorgeous day.",

I ate here twice on a visit, once for lunch and once for dinner, and was initially struck by the sheer beauty--and size--of the restaurant. It gets crazy busy on a Friday night and appears to be the only upscale bar in the area.Recommended dishes: 1) Veggie mac and cheese2) Chili: cup or bowl, cornbread on the side3) Lake Trout (I don't even like trout--it's my least favorite fish, likely because I have only had river trout with the bones and almonds and butter, but this was sublime with horseradish sauce)4) Pate which rivals the best I've eaten and is my personal favorite because it's mousse-like and light and not too heavy/strong but still exquisitely flavorful: it's better than the chicken livers at the Public Kitchen at Hollywood and served almost identically at a far lower price5) Fried grits--I know, this doesn't sound good at all but it has a chipotle aioli and for a decadent fried treat, you can't do better. I didn't know much about grits, as an LA girl, but apparently you can cook them without much fat and then unceremoniously dump a big hunk of butter on top so that it's like cream of wheat with butter, or you can do it more like the French with butter and cream, in which case it's far worse for you but tastes infinitely better. Executive chef Jessica Gorin subscribes to the second school of grit preparation and I wholly approve. 5) Beets: they were as good as the Purple Pig in Chicago but this is a \"bar bite\" (see below) so if you want a large portion, order two. 6) Chocolate bread pudding: this dessert rivals the Olio e Limone chocolate bread pudding with bananas which Julia Child cited as among her favorite desserts in Santa Barbara7) Pork belly: this has become trendy of late and some restaurants are pulling it from menus in big cities as people seem to be over it to some extent but Big Grove Tavern hits it out of the park with this appetizer. 8) Burger: some people in the area carped about the price of the burger here, not realizing that this is standard in LA and NYC (actually, their burger is cheaper than most fine dining burgers in cities I travel or live) and it's sheer perfection with the onions and cheese. The prices are reasonable and they offer a sort of mini-appetizer they call a \"bar bite,\" for 3 to 5 dollars. This is a nice option as you can try all sorts of sides for not a lot of money. The watercress soup was beautiful and subtle but the only dish on the menu that didn't send me into another galaxy. I truly believe Big Grove Tavern would be a hit in a city. In Champaign, which is a college town that feels infinitely smaller than it really is, with very few fine dining options, I see why the place is booming and if I lived in this tiny place, I'd eat here three times a week.",

The night we went, they had recently roasted an entire pig, so their specials were these amazing pork dishes. I enjoy pork quite a bit - beer and pork - since I've lived in Berlin and love German cuisine, so this place made me really happy.

We were advised that if we didn't have a reservation we would be sitting outside or at the bar due to a 45 minute wait.  Note that at the time we arrived 80% of the tables inside were empty - no problem, we enjoy sitting outdoors.  Side note: forty-five minutes later there are still twelve empty tables inside...We enjoyed the cumin flavored popcorn and ordered a wedge salad to share.  The wedge salad needs a little help (extra crumbles please) but the bacon had a distinct full smokey flavor and was very good.  We requested salt and pepper and they brought it out in little stainless dishes.  My wife ordered the scallops and I ordered the flank steak.  The scallops (four) were exceptionally good - flavorful and delicious.  The cornbread was just ok.  The flank steak was marginal but ok - served with delicious sides.  The wine and beer list is solid - lots of good choices.Good table service - steak could have been brought out hot off the grill but can't have it all.  My wife was unimpressed overall - note the menu prices are high. The atmosphere is upscale overall and the food presentation is excellent.  The menu options are limited.  The music is questionably appropriate for dinner but not offensive.",

I've been in this college town for 7 years now and ate at most of the places here and this comes across as one of the worst. The waiter messed up the order, which I mean it happens. Then the steak comes out, and it was way too salty. The sauce was too salty as it is, and then they added sea salt on it. When I told my waiter about it, some manager lady in her 40-50s came and took it back to have it redone. She did not apologize but instead shrugged and said \"that's the way we cook it here\";  face was stone cold and gave us a new set of silveware without saying a word. Talk about customer service. I do not know how this place stays in business with a manager like this. Bottom line is, if you're looking for a quick eat, then the food here is ok, comparable to steak and shake quality but 3x the price. If you're unlucky enough like me to see that manager with an attitude, then you're in for an experience.",

They strive to use locally-sourced ingredients and the wait-staff has been nothing but friendly and helpful. Every dish that I've eaten there has been absolutely melt-in-you-mouth fantastic. Seriously, try the roast chicken. They also offer a selection of house cocktails that are very tasty. Prices are about on par with the other \"fancier\" restaurants downtown which is to say that you can easily get an entre and a drink for between $15 and $25. You can certainly spend more and if you try, you can get out for under $10 a head.The atmosphere feels relaxed and trendy, the decor is pretty awesome, and I have to say that I love their music selection. It's current and recognizable without being overplayed or desperately obscure. Big Grove is high on my list if I feel like having a nice dinner.",

I had the trout dish last time and was extremely disappointed with the tiny piece of fish in the center of the huge plate it was served on. Not much flavor, not satisfying. The only menu item I would recommend is the Tavern burger. The service here is soooo slow. I took my mom here when she was visiting last month, wanting to give this place another try since the restaurant overall does have a nice atmosphere inside compared to other nearby places. Unfortunately I was disappointed again. It took our waiter too long to greet our table and then again too long to bring us our drinks. I ordered a pecan beer that he had suggested and when I tasted the beer, it seemed a little off but I figured that was just the flavor of it. Our meal took about an hour and a half to come out...and all we had ordered was a burger and the free range chicken dish. I think our waiter had forgotten to put in our orders till later. The couple seated next to us after we arrived had their meals a half hour before we did. When the check arrived, I see that my beer was in fact a $10 cider, not a $5 beer. Guess my taste buds were right. We paid the bill and left without complaining because we didn't feel like being there any longer than we were. Look, I understand things go wrong in restaurants and the server can't always control how long food takes and mistakes can be made. I am a server so I've been there. But I would've appreciated it if our server tried to do something to make up for our lackluster experience here. Not coming back here.",

If it were less expensive; maybe more in line with Blackdog or Dublin O'Neils prices it may have gotten 4 stars (whereas those other restaurants get 5 stars and 4 stars respectively). We started off with some deviled eggs that were good, and a fresh baked pretzel that had an unappealing mustard sauce.  I'll take Gulden's over that mustard sauce any day.  I ordered the burger and my girlfriend ordered a chicken salad sandwich.The burger was actually pretty good, cooked medium, with an egg and some onion maramalade on it.  The fries were decent but nothing to write about.The chicken salad was just a terrible sandwich.  Maybe one small scoop of flavorless chicken salad on hard toast for $9?  Get that thing off the menu.  Seriously.  People who order that sandwich will not come back.   The sweet potato chips on the side were pretty tasty though.Overall, not as great as I had hear, though maybe the chicken salad ruined the experience.  You want a burger, go to Blackdog or Farrens for a comparable one that costs half the price.  Want chicken salad better than this, go to your local gas station and buy a pre-made chicken salad.All that said, I'll give it another try.",

Sitting right in the middle of campustown, it's a hard place to miss, whether it's the big-on-wood exterior, the fantastically long lines to get in every Thurs/Fri/Sat night, or the plentiful logo mugs the average Illini will obtain, it's just the place to be.Few places outside of college campuses will you find $1 pints, or $3 you-call-its, $4 pitchers. Much lower key than Legends, Murphy's has the unique feel of being open to anyone willing to take a step out of their dorm roomsYou can't call your bar-hop night a barcrawl if you don't stop here. The food is good, the drinks cheap, and the people are always merry in Murphy's. I will miss every night I've remembered, or forgotten here.",

The place caters to the average college-aged individual who is content to fraternize with his or her colleagues over inexpensive alcoholic beverages and greasy diner food. While classier than the average campus-town bar, Murphy's by no means rivals the sophistication of the surrounding bars of downtown Champaign and Urbana. Classically, Murphy's tends to be more popular among the graduate and older undergraduate students, but that doesn't deter alumni and non-student patrons from frequenting. The beer selection outmatches any other bar on the University of Illinois campus and it is a bargain cost-wise compared to the non-campus bars. Food is typically served until 11 p.m. each night, with one of the most popular dishes being the \"Irish Nachos\" - essentially a whole plate of waffle fries decked with nacho toppings that you'll need a friend or two to finish. A host of burgers and other fried foods are also available with various specials throughout the week.  I have nothing but the fondest memories of Murphy's Pub. There's nothing ritzy about it, but if you're open to having (or reliving!) a fun yet relaxing college night, Murphy's is the place for you!",

If it's a weekend, the youngins usually find plenty of parties to attend so that's less of a problem, unless its moms or dads weekend where it can fill up just as quickly. They don't even serve their regular menu on nights like this which can be frustrating if you forget about campus life from time to time.

We also ordered shots separately and each shot was $2 for 0.5 fl oz. I was stunned. I have not really ventured to campus bars in my three-and-a-half years here because I consistently have bad experiences. 0.5 fl oz for a shot is the next level of low. Most campus bars at least pretend to not be totally lost and call 1 oz a shot... But 0.5 just leaves me speechless. Standard shot, you guys, is 1.5 fl oz. Nowhere else have I seen a recipe for mixed drink with an 8 to 1.5 mixer to liquor ratio. That's basically spiked Sprite. My point is, they have -1000 drink craftsmanship. Which is fine since apparently you're supposed to lower your standards on campus. But what really gets me is that they sell 0.5 oz dribbles of liquor and call it a shot... Food: Food service is poor though the food is fairly good. We waited an unusually long time for two burgers. We began to think something was wrong so we peeked into the kitchen (after asking a server and having to wait more) and it looked like the cook was cooking away... And then he ate the food. I get it... If I were working all night I'd get hungry too. But it's kind of strange delaying orders for an absurdly long time so that the cook can prepare and eat food from scratch.",

We used to come for Mug Night on Wednesdays so this place brings back great memories.It's been 8 years since I've been here, so I was really surprised when the food and beer was actually better than I remembered!  First of all, I already mentioned their beer on tap. it's quality and fresh! and low cost. Secondly, their burgers still rock in an awesome way! I had their Turkey burger while my friends had the regular cheeseburgers. Man oh man these burgers are juicy and seculent. The turkey burger is well flavored and succulent.  We basically scarfed down our meals including the yummy fries. Another good thing is that they also expanded this place - it used to be way too crowded but they added a whole other section to this place. They have a nice layout with table sizes that comfortably accomodate anywhere from 4 to parties in the teens. I love their spacious bench seat tables. If you're visiting U of I, definitely hit up this place! It's a cherished favorite.",

What a deal!A few people in the group ordered food and said it wasn't bad.  I cannot vouch or review the food as I did not partake.  From seeing the burgers, they looked pretty decent actually.  The process of ordering food was interesting.  There are no servers.  You go up to the food window, put in your order and give a name.  They then call your name over a PA system to the whole bar.  The speakers from this PA system sound like they came from the 70s when all you hear is squelching noise.  We pretty much looked over at the food window to see if it was us anytime the garbled noise came over the speakers.All in all this place is a dive.  If you want this type of thing, go for it!  If you want something a bit more upscale with servers and non-bar food, try somewhere else.  Personally, I'll be back for the cheap beers next time I am in town!",

There are the normal ones, but then more interesting drafts such as Bells, Warsteiner, Spaten, Summit, etc.  The burgers are great, but the fries vary in quality-- when they're good, they're really good... but othertimes not so much.  There is soup and chili in the winter, and the Irish Nachos are a U of I staple.  Usually is busy Wednesday thru Saturday, with Thursday being the best specials ($2 Import drafts and bottles, $2 Bacardi Singles, $4 Jim/Svedka Doubles, $6.75 Killians & Honey Brown pitchers).  If you want a table on those nights, you need to get their early. Sometimes the jukebox leads to very questionable music.",

Decent food, semi-cheap, good strong drinks (if you know the bartenders) and decent specials. After 12 there are definitely lines Thursday-Saturday nights, it's usually one in, one out. If you get a booth, it's a good place to chill out, play card games, indulge in some greasy-ness and hang with friends. The music is pretty loud for a laid back bar, so you will leave with a hoarse voice, but oh well. An added bonus is they have photo hunt.",

Sometimes it's great and there aren't any problems. But if it's crowded things quickly go downhill from there. For example, the last time I was there, I ordered Irish Nachos without bacon (because I'm vegetarian). The order (which is just fries with cheese and nacho toppings) took an hour. Once I got my order, it had bacon on it but I didn't send it back because I was so sick of waiting. Regardless to say, it definitely ruined the night to spend an hour hungry and waiting on food and then having to pick all of the bacon off.",

It's a very chill bar but at the same time can be crazy fun with some great music and good company. The jukebox there is always a fun way to get the night going and they always have a huge selection of songs to choose from. Also, it's the place to be these days on Thursday nights, as the lines can get insanely long and have up to 30-40 min wait times depending on the night. So my advice to you would be to arrive around 9pm-9:30pm to avoid any lines, cause as soon as 10 o'clock rolls around, you'll be waiting a little bit to get in.The specials are always nice, with the $7 killians on Thursday and $2 Pints for Bluemoon, how could you go wrong? Also, with the new area that opened up, the wait for drinks has gone down to much shorter. Love the new space and the addition of the air-hockey table in the basement as well. In addition, the food is delicious! Best burgers and fries on campustown. The double-cheeseburger deal on Wednesdays (i think, might have to check on this) is amaziiinnnng.  Overall, this bar is chill and fun at the same time. It's not as chill as Legends (granted Legends may have more seating) but I don't think you'll get the same experience when comparing the bars.",

I was excited to see that they had spicy cheese bites which thrilled me because growing up in Wisconsin consuming cheese curds while at the bar is a must. These were a rendition of the cheese curd but a very sub par one. The cheese inside was not hot enough so the cheese didn't squish out when eating them, it just kind of stuck to the breading. Next off, I had the burger. I ordered the mushroom burger which was the Tuesday special. When I got my burger it had no mushrooms on it and the cheese was barely melted. The topping such as the pickles, lettuce, tomato, and onion were fresh. The fries were mediocre at best. Coming in at 1:15 in the afternoon I didn't expect the place to have a big crowd but it was far too quite; No music was even playing.",

SERVICE IS TERRIBLE they are incredibly rude. 1st examplestanding at the bar watching a football game holding my money out on the counter so bartender knows i want a drink. next thing i know the bartender is in my face \"waving your money around wont get you served faster\". What the hell, i was standing there holding it on the bar, i wasn't even looking at you i was watching tv. 2nd examplecrowded for unofficial so i'm sure they are stressed. close out my tab, paid with a credit card but was going to leave a cash tip. Still reaching for my wallet bartender looks at 50 dollar tab with no tip. \"hey buddy, thats really a jerk thing to do, thanks\" again, what the hell! can i reach in my wallet to give you the cash, needless to say i said yeah your right and left without tipping. 3rd exampleusually the irish nachos are covered in toppings, most recent time hardly any. go back up to counter, its sunday no one is there so its not like its busy. Can i get some more toppings please i didn't get very much. Guy looks at me like i just punched his mother. answers slowly \"yeah... i guess i can\". he was pissed. Dude calm down i just want more toppings, didn't say it was terrible, get over yourself. thank god i love this place. except the servers. and not all are bad, just most.",

The best nights at Murphy's are Wednesdays and Thursdays.Wednesday is logo night so you can grab a pint and keep the glass for under $5 and refills are only $2.50 I think. Phenomenal deal. My cabinets are full of awesome logo glasses thanks to Murphy's. Thursdays are phenomenal because it's $2 pints. Any pint for just $2. You'll never beat that. I hear they may have upped it to $2.50 but that's a good variety of decent quality pints for just $2.50. Go out with a $10 bill and you'll have an awesome night. That simple, that's all you need.",

They're appropriately greasy, and when on special you can't beat the price. The chicken fingers leave something to be desired but, hey, it's not perfect.What you go to Murphys for is the beer. The draft list is surprisingly extensive, and while the selection of hard alcohol is weak (says the guy who's finished a whiskey passport at Seven Saints), the specials are fantastic (you can normally get a double of either Beam or Wild Turkey for $5 or less) and they have specialty pints for $2.50 on Thursdays. And it's not bad beer either. I normally get Fat Tire or Angry Orchard, but they even have some decent IPA's on tap (sayeth my beer snob friends). Murphy's is often crowded, and for graduate students, there's a very real risk of running into students, but it's my favorite place in Campustown and a really good bar overall.",

The Irish Nachos is good to order with two more people. The other appetizers are just ok (hmm, the spicy cheese bites are good, although small), but there's usually some food special everyday.Because of the regular coming, you develop certain bonds with the place, even if the place is not great. If this bar was located anywhere outside Campus, I dont think I would ever go there. However, the memories make the place and thats pretty much how Murphys survives.",

Wednesday is Logo Glass Night, and I have several boxes of the great glasses I accumulated over the years.Their beers on tap is great, especially for a campus bar.  The food is pretty good pub grub, but I believe there is a \"game-day menu\" where only certain things are served, which is kind of a bummer if you want Irish nachos on game-day because it's not on the menu.  The jukebox is great (every fricking song by The Black Keys can be found on there) and there are loads of flat screens to catch whatever game is on.  If you get there early, you won't even have to pay a cover.",

You go in and order at the bar, and then walk to the back where they prepare your order to pick it up.There's usually no cover here at night (with the exception of special occasions such as Unofficial, Mom's/Dad's weekend, etc.) and have good, knowledgeable bartenders.  There's a wide selection of beers - over 25 I believe? - and they make a kickass Amaretto Sour (my fav next to Irish Car Bombs, btw, so you should buy me one if you see me out at the bars ever ^__~, they're like a Starburst in a glass!).  Like all the other bars, this place gets quite crowded on weekends and as everyone else here has commented on, the jukebox is loud and, at $1 a song, gets heavy use/abuse.  Some of the stuff that comes out of that thing... I don't know, man... =PThe specials here are also pretty sweet - yay for logo glass night.  Overall, it's just a great campus bar to frequent anytime.",

It was a sunday and we wanted to catch the NFL games so, naturally, we went up to a bar. Murphy's was our 3rd choice (after the other 2 bars were either closed or not showing any games). The place was empty (not surprising coming from a college town where all they care about is Saturday Football) except for a couple of old guys talking to themselves.They had a lot of TVs and only one game on, when we asked them to switch it they couldn't because they didn't own the football package -strike one-Despite the place being deserted our server never took our order and we had to go up to the bar to have them take it. There is some controversy about this, as some bars will have you do that in the early evening but I've been to bars in the middle of nowhere at the same time where this wasn't the case. Either way, that was a bit annoying, so strike two.Strike three came along when after ordering we had to pick up our own food at the kitchen. At that point we gave up on good expectations and simply sat down to watch the game.The good news is their food is amazing. My friend and I are no fans of fries either but man they were awesome! And their bean burger was gigantic and extremely good according to my friend, while I had the steak sandwich and that was absolutely perfect.In any case, chances are the place is legit on Saturday Game Day, but it's up to you if you want to try it out.",

The inside is pretty big, there's a few different rooms and even a downstairs that we didn't get a chance to check out.We shot a few games of pool and were able to have decent conversation due to the music being at an actually reasonable volume. They had several drink specials, I was able to get a Harp for $2.50 and McGillicudy shots were only $2 also. I'll have to come back when the Guinness is on special (if it ever is).The only thing I wasn't too happy about was the service. It was quite slow. It seemed like they were a little understaffed.

The expansion has made it much easier to walk around the bar on the weekend nights when everyone is cramming in. Finding seating is less of a rat race, but I'd still say to arrive earlyish if you don't want to be standing.  The bathrooms can get a little sketchy, but I pretty much expect that from a campus bar. The jukebox has some interesting selections, and the music is usually good overall. It's my current favorite place to go and hang out with friends while not spending loads of money at the same time.",

The more people you can fit in the bar, the shorter the line outside!  I haven't had food here in years, but I know it's super cheap.  Drinks are cheap too, decent draft beer selection for a campus bar, and it's surprisingly not that hard to snag a table (there are a whole bunch of them).  I've had many an evening here, dancing in that space in front of the jukeboxes.  And you should know that this is not a place where a lot of people dance - it's mostly just people drinking, probably shaking their heads and laughing at my friends and I dancing around like idiots to Bon Jovi.  But you know, Murphy's just makes me feel comfortable enough to do that.  The jukebox blows on busy nights though - even if you pay extra for \"play next,\" like 10 other people already did that so you might not hear your songs at all.  And you'll probably have to sit through a lot of stupid crap that other people picked out before you get to any good music.  I guess it just depends on the crowd.  Either way, we always stop at Murphy's when we come back to Champaign and I know we always will!",

I really liked the atmosphere of the bar. It was a great place to watch the game I think next time but will just go for drinks since I didn't think the food was so great. I ordered the salmon slider and the salmon was so salty it was inedible. The other slider I ordered was okay nothing to rave about but the worst was the California turkey burger my friend ordered. The menu said it had avocado on it which it did but it was such a minuscule amount we literally cracked up about it.Its a clean bar and quiet enough to watch a game AND still hear the commentary but you might want to eat before you get there though.",

The slider was a little dry for me, but the salad was very good! Our server was very friendly and quick, and the location is perfect if you work near downtown Champaign. From what I saw inside the restaurant, it looked like a pretty calm atmosphere. Outside seating is very good! Overall, if you're looking for a lunch place, Seven Saints is a great choice.

The staff were friendly and knowledgeable both times, and they were eager to help suggest drinks to try.  The cocktails were tasty, although a little on the strong side for my tastes.  When we had a party too large for the tables in front, they gladly opened the back room for us to all sit at the same table.The sliders were good, the soup was hot and tasty, and I really enjoyed the casual atmosphere of the place.

It's also the place I recommend when people from out of town ask where they should go for dinner. The service there is very friendly and prompt, and the food is good. I've never had the salmon burgers, but I wouldn't expect the fish dishes to be the best in the heart of Central Illinois anyway. The Buffalo Chicken Slider and Classic Slider with Cheese are my favorites, along with a side of waffle fries (although if you're a fan of sweet potato fries, they have the best in town). The chipotle ranch sauce that comes with the onion rings is amazing, the tomato bisque is absolutely out of this world and they have a great selection of whiskey and beer at the bar. I really think of this place as more of a restaurant than a bar though. They tend to get busy on Friday and Saturday nights, and if the wait is long, make sure you're back earlier than you think if you decide to walk around the area. Definitely one of the gems in Champaign-Urbana and a place that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good meal at a decent price.",

                "review": "This restaurant/bar is conveniently located in downtown Champaign. We sat down around 6PM on a Sunday Night for dinner.Appetizer: Get the half order of pretzels. I believe this is a new menu item which comes with 2 giant soft pretzels, mustard for dipping, and an amazing jalepeno cheese sauce. The pretzel was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of salt. I could have eaten a bowl of that jalepeno cheese sauce.Main course: I love it when restaurants allow you to combine menu items, like any variety of a soup/ salad/ sandwich combo. At SS, you can definitely create a combo to your liking. I ordered the soup with half sandwich. The price and quality just blew my mind. You think a tomato bisque soup is boring? Seven Saints will change that opinion of yours! I got that tomato bisque soup with half a tuna melt sandwich and i was in food heaven.Dessert: It's very rare that I have room in my stomach for an appetizer, main course, and dessert. Well, I didn't have room, but that didn't stop me from ordering a sweet sensation. The blueberry cheesecake with ginger crust was absolutely incredible, and I don't regret that decision one bit.Service: Impeccable. I ordered an arnold palmer to drink, and I never saw the bottom of my glass. The food was prompt and our server was helpful. Even with the packers vikings game on TV, we had an extremely pleasant time.I know Illinois is known for good food, but man, I was not expecting this amazingness :) A++++++",

I typically came here on a date with the wife when she visited me during graduate school. We had to live separately for two years but enjoyed our evenings here before her flight home out of CMI. Although it's a whisky bar, they had an interesting selection of wine and beer. I always got the Mojo IPA and she got her Riesling. Aside from the relationship, this is also where I came to prefunk with the roommate before our Thursday night pubcrawls with the School of LER. Initially, my first roommate introduced me to this place when I first arrived to Champaign. We were paired by Burnham's roommate matching system. He was this smart computer science whiz. We drank here on weekends. He moved on to work for Skype. My second roommate was a Korean born Mexican. He was fluent in Spanish which culturally, he loved whisky. I think I was appointed as his wingman because he was this strange kimchee taco hybrid that was soaked in whisky that came off as a creeper. The Chinese Beijing girls loved him though and our strategies to get him laid all started here at Seven Saints. The irony is that, there was nothing Saint like going on at this establishment when we were there.",

I was even more hopeful when my friend and I walked in. The design of this place is awesome. It's really nice looking with good lighting. It looks trendy and cool. Unfortunately, it's an illusion to cover up the rest of the place. It's a pretty boring menu. It's American cuisine that focuses on slider-sized sandwiches. I had the fried chicken slider, and it was okay. Pretty much just literally fried chicken on a bun. It's not any better than I could have gotten at a fast food place, and for much cheaper. I wish I could have tried more sliders, but we were stopping in before a concert, so it was what it was. It's the kind of restaurant that is made to look like it's trendy but it's really just a normal joint with a nice paint job and design to it, and the ambiance isn't worth the extra price in my opinion. The food isn't bad, just average. What really brings this rating down for me is the staff. The service is absolutely terrible. First of all, it was so slow. We ordered one slider each, it shouldn't take that long, especially when the restaurant is packed. Not only was our waitress slow, but she was unbelievably rude. The friend that I went with is male. I, obviously, am female. I might as well have not existed. All of the questions, flirtations, \"are you okays?\" were directed at him, and when I said anything, I got an eye roll and a curt nod. I get it. Guys will probably tip you better. But that's no reason to just blatantly be a terrible server, because we obviously came in together, so you should probably be nice to us together. He was embarrassed for both of us, and made a point to try and ask me questions in front of her, but she just was not getting the hint. It was awkward for both of us, and helped to ruin an otherwise lovely evening out. I'd try this place again maybe if I'm ever in the neighborhood again, but I'd definitely be careful about in whose section I was seated. The second star of this review is for atmosphere alone.",

Finally my co-workers decided to make this the weekly spot to go out to eat, so I was more than happy to tag along.  We went around 12 noon, on a weekday.  The inside is pretty cozy and nicely decorated.  It's almost imperial looking with the large hanging drapes as curtains.  We had a large group of 10, and fortunately we were able to get a table.  The place itself seems very large, as there were from what I could tell, 3 distinct areas to sit in, and an outside dining area as well.All and all though, the place came across as very average to me once everything was said and done.   Granted the restaurant was pretty busy, it took our server literally 15 minutes to come get our order, and another 15 to just get our drinks (and most of us just had water).The food did not take too long to come out, but once again I wasn't impressed at all.  I got the club sandwich with waffle fries, and I can't say it was bad at all, but there was just not a thing special about it.  It's your typical greasy fare typee of place too... Fries oozing grease, bread and buns slathered with butter, etc.  I also tried some of the cheese curds (sounds disgusting, but quickly found out it's just like a round mozerella stick), waffle fries, sweet potato fries, and a classic slider (which apparently is what they are known for... sliders that is)  All of it was just very average, and even the acclaimed slider was nothing special.  I would probably not go here again if I had the choice, but other than I long wait to get waited on and an even longer one to get some drinks, there is really nothing too major I can dock the restaurant for other than it just did not appeal to me much personally.  I should note our server was very friendly, but I just can't really get into the food.  Just a very average joint.",

                "review": "This is one of my favorite local restaurants in CU. First of all, the atmosphere is really amazing. A lot of care was taken to make the inside of this place something special. It has a slightly dark, gothic feel yet it still feels very cozy and inviting. I do wish the space was a bit bigger, however, as it can get busy very quickly and you'll run out of places to sit.Service-wise I've almost always had great service. The wait-staff is friendly and the bartenders are fast and responsive. They have a nice selection of spirits. The best part has to be the food, though. They have a nice selection of salads. My absolute favorite is the Seven Saints Salad. I've never tasted anything quite like it. It has a crisp bed of greens topped with tiny hot green peppers and a VERY generous portion of pieces of steak. The steak is flavorful and moist and the whole salad has a clear dressing that compliments the other components perfectly. The best part is that you can have the salad as part of a special served with a couple of their sliders for around $8. It's a great deal.Speaking of their sliders, they have a really wonderful selection of mini-hamburgers. They aren't as heavily greasy as you might expect from a traditional slider. My favorites are probably the Asian slider with it's wasabi spread, the Buffalo Chicken slider (with an amazing sauce on a crispy piece of chicken and served with ranch dip) and the Blacjack burger. There are a ton more and pretty much anything to suit your taste.Another standout aspect of Seven Saints are their appetizers. If I have one complaint it's that they seem incapable of keeping their Beet Chips ready to order. Out of the five times I've tried to order them, I've only ever been able to get them twice. I don't know if I've just had bad timing or what but I do wish they were a bit more diligent with those. If you do manage to order them they are delicious and are served with a yummy goat cheese dip. If they are out of them, there are still a lot of great options. You can't go wrong with either of their mushroom appetizers.",

I was told they were famous for their sliders, so I chose the Chicago Dog slider, mainly because I love Chicago Dogs and also because it was out of the ordinary. The slider was very good, but a little overpriced. Not wanting to fill up on just sliders, I also got the Chipotle salad which was very well done and was tasty and surprisingly filling for a salad. I enjoyed the atmosphere- relaxed with good music playing. The waiter was friendly, but not very attentive, especially considering it was not that busy. I had to ask several times just to get a refill on my water. I often judge a place by asking myself if I would go back again.  For Seven Saints, the answer would be yes, if I happened to be in the area, but I wouldn't go way out of my way to get there.",

One of our favorite things to do together outside of work is drive over to Seven Saints for Whiskey Wednesday and just start buying each other rounds of amazing, 1/2-off whiskey.  1/2-off whiskey alone is worth 5 stars to me, but what really puts Seven Saints over the top are their amazing sliders.  They have about 8 or so different kinds and since they're relatively small you can comfortably have 2-3 of them in one meal.  Top that off with some waffle fries and ranch dressing and I'm the happiest camper.",

It's just.. it's so good. I've always been a ribeye steak fan, and in my teens when I first learned they make sandwiches out of them, I think I cried tears of joy. Ever since my first bite, I've been on the hunt for the next best ribeye sandwich.. and my friends, I search no more.I order mine blackened, medium-rare, with their delicious waffle fries. The first time I decided on this sandwich, I didn't have high expectations. I had ordered sliders here in the past and found them just okay. However, when they brought out my huge, melty, tender, delicious sandwich, I could hear the angels singing. It was GLORIOUS. I ate every single bite, and within 2 days I found myself back at Seven Saints, ordering another. This is my all time favorite steak sandwich, and I order it often.Aside from this amazing sandwich, the service is always good and the atmosphere is friendly and inviting. They even have ginger ale on tap, YES! Anytime I've been less than 100% satisfied, the staff has been completely accommodating and has removed any problem item from the bill, AFTER replacing it for me. I couldn't have better things to say about this establishment!",

Everything is very clean, and spotless. There is a wood bar and lots of tables and booths abound. Again, very nice and clean. Not a lot of character, but enjoyable.The quality is fine. Nothing wrong with the taps or bottles. The service is decent as far as taking orders and knowing what they have. Though I had to argue with several bartenders to get a half pint of a Barleywine. I don't know why that should be an argument?The food is decent. Though I am not really a fan of everything being a \"slider.\" That makes a lot of the menu a la cart. My first visit, I ended up with a steak salad, but there was not much steak to be seen. What was there was tough and chewy.  The salad was a bit slimy as well.  The sliders are nothing bad, they just never seem to live up to what I would expect from the description.Besides a few decent offerings, the tap list is pretty generic. Eight taps that consist of Blue Moon, Fat Tire Guinness, Magic Hat, some BMC, Southern Tier Seasonal, and a managers choice (Arcadia Barleywine when I first visited).  That rotates a bit, so the selection does change.  The bottle list somewhat makes up for the sub par tap list. Mostly the usual suspects like Rogue, Bells, Goose Island, Founders, etc. Overall decent, but not ground breaking (considering the handful of really good beer bars in walking distance).Overall, just an average place to grab a beer and a meal. A slightly above average beer selection, and slightly above average food. There is really nothing that distinguishes this place above the many other restaurant in the area, and there are much better beer bars in the area without a doubt.",

The salad I got - country fried chicken - was AMAZING. Their honey mustard dressing is light and tangy. I loved the many julienned red onion and cucumber and half cherry tomaotes! By far my favorite part of the meal. Now. The iced tea. Nuh-uh. Is NOT raspberry flavored. Very small cup for the price.I stole my sister's sweet potato fries and eh... Guido's has better. Seven Saint's fries are overly crunchy and weirdly shaped.My friend said the beer selection, though large, didn't have what he really wanted. Also, he said the Seven Saint's salad is a little...offputting. The lime and nut and fruit combo did not a salad make.The actual restaurant was pretty nice. Clean tables. The barstools weren't uncomfortably high. The service was nice, but slow. The server forgot my friend's beer, and was late with the drinks, but was very cheerful and helpful. My sister said the bathrooms were passable.Probably will come back, but will remember to get at least two sliders and a dinner-sized salad.",

I came into visit shortly after it opened and it's never been overly packed (except the outdoor seating is always full), which is nice. I'd say it's more for an older crowd or at least a more relaxed one. The variety of beer and wine is awesome. I thought the sliders there were delicious, same with the soups and salads. Of all of the bars downtown, this one definitely has the best food.The actual atmosphere on the other hand is really nice. There are old pews, vintage chandeliers, and a beautiful wooden piece in the back of the main room all from old Churches, and it was the 7th bar opened by the owner, hence the name Seven Saints. It's all pretty cute and makes a nice place to have an outside dinner. I'd recommend it for sure!",

I wish they had a \"slider flight\" option where you get a deal for 3 sliders or something. The service was prompt and friendly even with our large group. The sliders were.....okay......the bread was kind of mushy and not impressive. The garnishes were more like the quality you'd see at Subway and the beef reminded me of Wendy's or White Castle. Is it the shape, dense texture, or just general tastelessness? I can't quite put my finger on it but it's just not impressive considering its their \"specialty\". The prices are okay but considering that you could probably get better burgers at a fast food restaurant, I feel like they could be cheaper but I guess you're paying for the ambiance and service. Personally, I don't need ambiance, I go out to enjoy unique, high quality food. Ideally, rather than cheaper prices, I think just higher quality food would make more sense. On the plus side, I could see this place being good for picky eaters who are repelled by too many flavors in their food.",

Perhaps the owners need to start dropping back in or have people mystery shop the place.The menu - while not wildly innovative - was well thought out. The appetizers are well done and set up to share, though the fried portabella mushroom strips on the Seven Sinners plate had that 'I've sat in cold storage' flavor to them. That said, the cheese curds and also the beet chips were excellent. I liked the sliders - favoring the blackjack and the buffalo chicken slider. The triple-S plate used to be more of a deal when they would allow you to get two sliders and either a soup or salad. I was sorry to see that go. I've not tried the specials, and each time I've been everyone has done sliders, sandwiches, soup, or salads - so I cant speak to them. The desserts are nothing special, but were decently presented.Out first few trips, the staff was excellent.  We were seated relatively quickly despite being packed. Someone came to take our drink orders in the first few minutes. The waitress was willing to explain things to my party and make substitutions to satisfy vegetarian friends. The beer selection was decent and the mixed drinks were decently strong. While prices were a bit on the steep side, we were fairly happy. On a later trip, the service was slow, the raspberry iced tea was short on the raspberry syrup, and to be frank - I felt rushed out the door once we were done with our entree. That was too bad as the people I was with are the sort prone to ordering dessert and a couple rounds of drinks. If the place was crowded, I could have understood, but it seemed sort of empty.Other reviews have mentioned a chain-like feel. It's true the same group owns a few other local bars - so I'm assuming they use the same architects, designers, and back-office staff. That said, I kind of like the decor and think with a little work on the service Seven Saints could warrant four stars.",

I love the ambiance of the corner bar, dark wood, and dimly lit interior and the extensive offerings of specialty vodkas, gins, and whiskeys.  The cheese curd appetizer was very good but not out of this world.  The beer batter was a little soft and I suspect the cheese had not been frozen prior to deep frying (or not completely), which resulted in most of the cheese over-melting and dripping out of the solidified batter shell.  Still tasty, but missing the mark a little bit.  The sliders were pretty good, but the BBQ had too much botte-tasting sauce on it.  The beef was cooked perfectly though.  Caesar salad was average at best.  On the plus side, they have a nice selection of draft and bottled beer.",

Unfortunately they ran out of their cheese curds when we came, so we ordered their onion rings instead. They were the best I've had in years - very crunchy, not soggy at all. I had the original slider, which was flavorful and juicy, and the buffalo chicken one, which was also delicious. I shared the onion rings with my boyfriend and the 2 sliders which had me slightly full. Though I didn't get anything to drink that day, their menu was very extensive, which had me impressed. Definitely gonna come back for the cheese curds and possibly a drink... some time in the future.",

I still go back every year for Christmas to visit family and friends, and when I do, Seven Saints is a must-hit place for food. And I get the same thing every single time.The Triple S Combo Platter. One salmon slider. BLT salad (although I have also tried the Country Fried Chicken Salad... sounds weird but was really tasty). And the tomato basil soup. This is a trifecta of yumminess in my tumminess. There has only been once when the food all tasted kind of off, possibly a bad day. But every year, it always pleases me. And the bill isn't so bad. I don't really drink here, but have had a mojito that was alright, nothing special. I will continue frequenting this establishment for my yearly Christmas visiting. Please stay in business Seven Saints, otherwise I will be forced to make this food on my own and it won't be pretty.",

Exactly, what I was thinking it's not Tuesday Brewsday or their famous Whiskey Wednesday's but a Monday! I had no idea that they have Ribeye dinners on Mondays and 1/2 Price Wine by the bottle. If you are looking for a dinner cure to your manic Monday I would totally suggest Seven Saints! The steak was cooked a perfect medium per my request and was served with broccoli and mashed potatoes. I think the 1/2 off wine bottle speaks for itself. Iggy was my server for the evening and he gave us the best service even though we arrived 30 minutes before the kitchen closed which was 11pm. Thanks Iggy!! Hope you find this review useful!!",

The train got in over an hour late (which seems to be a common occurrence on this route), but I was still a few hours early for the game, so I grabbed some lunch at this place, which is right across the street from the Amtrak station. I was happy to see that it was not jam packed on game day morning. I was by myself so I sat at the bar. I was impressed with the large selection of beers available, both on tap and by the bottle. I'm used to Chicago prices, so being able to get a good draft beer for under 5 bucks was great. They also have Miller High Life on tap for $2 if you're looking to go \"cheap.\"Food wise, I went with a couple turkey sliders, since the menu claims that is what they are \"famous\" for. I also had some of the sweet potato fries. The sliders were just okay, I wasn't blown away by them or anything. Same thing with the fries. The portion was large, but I wasn't crazy about them (I went ahead and doused them in ketchup after I realized they weren't that good). It was a meal that was adequate, and not expensive (each slider was $2.50 and the fries were $1.99 if I am remembering correctly), so I'm not complaining. My total for 2 draft beers, the food, and tip was just over $20.The bartender introduced himself as \"Billy Mays\" and had on an Oxyclean shirt, which was his Halloween costume. He was nice enough and occasionally engaged in small talk, even as the place started to get more crowded. I didn't have any problems with him keeping my water and beer full, and my food was correct, so no issues there.When all is said and done, I can't give this place 5 stars simply because I wasn't blown away by anything. But this is definitely a sold 4 star establishment.",

Do yourself a favor and ask the waiter/waitress his/her opinion on the amount of food you order- it's very easy to order too much for your party to handle.Beer: Some great seasonal beers on tap for not too much $. You can expect to see draft, seasonal beers for $4, and other beers for cheaper. There are tons of draft and bottled choices. This place has a great bar to sit, watch games, and enjoy an ice cold brew.Service: I was only with one other person so we asked to sit (and eat) at the bar. We had 2,3 staff members (bar tenders) help each other out when it came to waiting on us. They have a team approach- which leads to faster service. The bartenders knew their Illini sports, cared about the downtown Champaign environment by knowing about that weekend's events, and were very down to earth.Overall: I had a fantastic meal, including appetizers, and a beer for $21. A similar place in Chicago would be double that- and the food wouldn't be better either. Downtown Champaign has fantastic bars and eats, and this place is one of them. Seven Saints covers all of the bases- i've eaten here with my family for special occasions, and i've come here in the wee hours of the morning to get my drink on.",

My fiance and I waited at the bar for a drink for about 15 minutes before anyone asked us what we wanted. That may not sound too long, but the place wasn't even busy. And what's funny is the bartender was like purposely ignoring us. There's no way she didn't see us politely flagging her down. She had a soft drink that she was drinking, and she stopped right in front of us, took a nice looooong drink... kind of relaxing, then she looked past us out the window, and proceeded to ignore us a bit longer. And its not like we were just standing there, you can try and flag them down, but they just ignore you like alien possessed humans staring into space or something. The bartender finally asked what we wanted, but by then we were being seated so we said nevermind. Then we proceeded to have terrible service at our table, to the point that it was just kind of amusing. Oh and my cobb salad had these huge mushroom tentacle things that made me gag and we just sorta wiggled them at our friends like \"look at this huge sick thing that's in my salad!\" And the sliders are way over priced. The cheese curds were good, but a little heavy. I say the place has potential because it's a really nice location and the inside has a nice ambiance. There is also an extensive beer list, but none of that really matters if your service is that bad...",

The food: the cheese curds are okay. I'm not sure why everyone thinks they are so incredible? Maybe the massive size? The sliders are pretty good, but I don't think the quality warrants the price. I had the black and blue salad and it was a huge portion for a half size which was awesome! But the taste was not there. It was pretty awful.

My grilled cheese came out with one slice of hard, dried to the bread, cheese on two huge pieces of Texas toast.  It was so dry I had to ask for marinara sauce to dip it in just to choke it down.  So not worth it- flavorless and disgusting.  Kinda like how I feel about everything else I have ordered there.  OK for drinks, but avoid the food. Oh, and don't bother complaining to the GM, Andy.  He could care less. Way to keep customers.",

I truly believe they need to decided which one they are. The menu is confusing and to extensive. They have a lot of options and the combinations are limiting. I got a Black and Blue Salad and my husband tried the bratwurst slider and the fried chicken slider. The fried chicken slider tastes exactly like a McChicken!!! Truly amazing.... Only the real thing is bigger. The bratwurst slider was ok. The meat was good, the bread was soggy and the sauerkraut was lacking in crunch. My salad was ok in flavor. The meat was microwaved and had no crispy ends... Clearly reheated. The mushrooms were soggy and had the same look as large slugs. The soup tasted great!!!! But after asking if it was homemade, our server said it was bagged. We were offered the shrimp tacos, but the shrimp is previously frozen too. I'm still disappointed in Seven Saints. They need to decide what they are. A fancy bar or an American lunch spot, they can't be both. It's not working.  I would love to see the mood lightened and the have a fantastic sandwich shop instead!! Or, simplify the menu, make it classy and keep the dark dinner atmosphere. Sorry I can't do better, but I don't lie in my reviews.",

We got there around 8pm. I knew this place was usually busy but when we put our name in, they said it would take 30 minutes. So we figured we would wait since we had not been there in a long time. After an hour of waiting, they were able to seat 6 people. The other 6 had to wait for an adjacent table to open up. It did not open up for another 30 minutes. So I was just really confused on how they would tell us it would take 30 minutes when really it took 1 hour and 30 minutes. The first half of our group had already ordered for us in an attempt to save some time since everyone was starving. After we were seated, it took about 10 minutes for our server to come ask us what we wanted to drink, and then another 10 minutes to actually get our drinks. The food was alright. I usually get different sliders, but decided to try the steak sandwich. It was pretty good, a little messy though since there was a ton of oil that came with it. After we finished, the guy took all of our plates, and then it took 10 minutes for him to ask us if we were ready for the check. then it took him another 10 minutes to get us the check. And then another 10 minutes to charge all the cards. That was one of the worst dining experiences I've had. Over 2 hours of just waiting for things. You would think that with a larger group, he would have paid more attention to us but guess it doesn't work that way.Like I said earlier, I've been here before and they were ok experiences, which accounts for the 2nd star. But we'll see if I ever go back in the near future. Just pissed that we waited so long when the server kept saying it would be 5-10 more minutes every time we asked.",

I've never heard any complaints or noticed any discrimination or racism. People are overwhelmingly happy with their experiences here, as evidenced by how busy it is. Wednesdays do tend to get hectic, so if you are high-maintenance / demanding / have a chip on your shoulder, you may want to pick a different night to go. If you're a normal person like 99% of the other people around, you'll have a good time.With that out of the way, Seven Saints is THE PLACE to drink whiskey, especially on Wednesday, with a 1/2-price special on one of four rotating themes. Every whiskey they have is in one of the themes and will be 1/2-price on its respective day. They have an incredible selection with a whole menu page or two for each theme. The bartenders that work that night are passionate about whiskey and it shows. They know their stuff and can always make a good recommendation based on what you like, tell you why they recommend it for you, tell you what to look for, and answer any questions.",

But this place is a sanctuary for the rest of us who just like to drink whiskey and eat tiny burgers with our friends. I highly suggest the salmon sliders although at $4 a pop they are pretty costly. I pretty much only come on whiskey Wednesdays so I can sample the best that they have. The waiters are always really helpful and will suggest whiskey for you to try even if you're not used to drinking them. Seating can be limited depending on what time you come but if you can grab a table outside during the cooler nights of summer, you'll never find a better place. It is on university so it can be a bit noisy due to traffic.",

On a Sunday evening, we were seated outside immediately and our waiter was accommodating and attentive without hovering.  We each ended up going with the slider and salad combo with sweet potato fries on the side.  I chose the salmon slider (complete with cucumber and dill sauce) and the salmon salad (a more Mexican take with a southwest ranch dressing) & I was extremely content with my choices; even having some leftovers for lunch the next day! In my opinion, the portions were definitely very reasonable.  The sliders were about the size of the diameter of a standard water or beer glass or at least that is what our waiter told us! Seven Saints ended up being the perfect spot to catch up with old friends over some delicious food; I'd definitely recommend this joint to anyone with a rumbling tummy in downtown Chambana!",

Their food menu has a nice balance of innovation and old standards and was well-executed for everything our group of 6 ordered. Service is quick (turn and burn, baby!) even when they're full. If you are careful, the food and drink is actually quite reasonably priced: soup/sandwich combo, 2x beers, huge club with excellent sweet potato fries all for $30 (whiskey tab was a different story- but worth it). You certainly could spend more on you food here, but if you get the cheap stuff you will still be happy. Also, on Wednesdays, they have HALF price on all their whisky/ey!The bartender also runs classes on the appreciation of this complex but enthralling (some would even say intoxicating) beverage.",

The fact that we have not been back since then probably implies something.We had some pretty darn good onion rings for an appetizer. My wife had a Tomato Pesto Grilled Cheese sandwich that we thought was pretty good, along with a nice Tomato Bisque. I had a trio of Sliders: Asian, Tropical Stack, and Salmon, served with Sweet Potatoe Fries.I grew up in an area that had White Castle restaurants. Now, I never went there unless pressed, but I do know what a slider is.The problem with these was not the taste, which was fine. Nor the size, which was small. The problem is that sliders are moist / greasy. Now, I'm not saying that having a non-greasy slider is a bad thing from a healthful eating perspective. But if you're going to call something a slider, there has to be something non-dry about it. sigh.Service was friendly.I would like to get back there and try some other items, but we always seem to think of someplace else we'd rather eat.",

The crowd was what looked like a mix of graduate students and older couples.Seven Saints is known for their sliders, these mini burgers, kinda like what White Castle serves. The sliders are about $3 to $4 bucks each so it's perfect for ordering a slew of them. I ordered fried cheese curds  for appetizers which were delicious though a little soggy (then again, anything fried pretty much tastes good). There are plenty of vegetarian options. Any slider can be replaced with a boca burger (50 cents extra), but in my opinion a boca burger patty overwhelms any other taste. So what you end up with is pretty same tasting burgers - my boca blackjack cheese slider tasted like my Asian one. The waffle fries were especially good though (better than The Office's ones in Urbana IMO). The beer selection is limited so this place is decent to take group for dinner - there are better bar options for drinks elsewhere. The service was adequate and attentive, but not overly so. What's with the Third Eye Blind love? There were like 3 TEB songs that played that night :S There's also some outdoor seating. I could definitely image coming back here for lunch.I also like the fact that Seven Saints is directly across from the bus/train station (who needs to spend 10 bucks on a cab when there's convenient public transportation nearby? My friends rode their bikes here and took a bus back home (they have racks on the front of the bus to load bikes).All in all, Seven Saints is a decent option for lunch and dinner, but you can find better spirits elsewhere (i.e. Blind Pig, others)",

I'm boring and stick to the bacon ones, but on occasion I branch out; the tropical ones are also really good. What really sets this place apart are the chicken tenders, which are the best I've ever tried. They're reasonably priced and listed on the appetizer menu, but totally worth getting as a main course. The tomato bisque is apparently very good as well (but screw tomatoes, I'm sticking with the food).As good as the food is, the bar is even better. While the drinks are a bit expensive, if you come on Wednesday, various whiskeys are half off. They also have specials on Monday and Tuesday for wine and beer, respectively. I love the bar selection, though. Wednesdays are my favorite day, because I come to Seven Saints and try various whiskeys to sort out my likes and dislikes. If you (or someone you know) is trying to get into whiskey, this is a great place to do it. My personal favorites are the Elmer T. Lee and the various shades of Pappy they have (especially the Old Rip Van Winkle which is fantastic). My only quibble is that the whiskey passports are a bit of a ripoff. It's $5 for the little book, but normally that'd also come with some sort of swag (like a t-shirt or glass) when finished. It'd make a nice little memento for finishing the entire (64 entry) passport. Still, a great place and such a minor nitpick it barely merits mentioning. Seven Saints is fantastic.",

Hey everybody has an off night! My husband and I enjoy not the run of the mill beers and we were surprised to find extensive selection at seven saints. Goose island 312 for me and fat tire for my spouse.We started our dinner off with fried cheese curds. The cheese curds were golden brown and not greasy,they come highly recommended!We each ordered 2 sliders and a side of waffle fries. I had Asian and smoked BBQ slider and Doug ordered BBQ and California turkey slider. All were cooked to perfection and delicious . They have several options when it comes to the menu so I feel there is something for everyone. All in all we had a wonderful dining experience and our waitress( once we got one) was on the ball and friendly. We will be returning and I would recommend Seven Saints to our friends.",

Also, I really love the rib eye steak sandwich, its pricey ($10), but its amazing and it comes with a side (onion rings are killers in here).There is also the possibility of ordering combos with salad, soup, etc... I never had that, but I heard its pretty good.Bottom line: this place is a MUST in Champaign. During weekend it might get crowded and with a waiting line, usually I go by myself, so I never had that problem.",

This would be okay if they hadn't hidden the drafts behind columns such that it's impossible to discover what types of beer they have.The food menu was more promising.  It's split into two parts:  half the items were ripped off from Crane Alley (beet chips with goat cheese, sweet potato fries, cajun crab cake) and the other half are \"sliders\".  Upscale White Castle.Frankly, the food wasn't particularly bad.  My friend enjoyed his salad.  But it wasn't particularly good either:  his slider was only so-so and my sandwich was like a salt lick.  But I probably would have gone back just to break up the monotony of eating downtown if the service hadn't sucked.When our waitress finally got around to us, I ordered a sandwich.  She came back five minutes later to tell me that there had been a \"permanent substitution\" with that item.  By substitution, she meant that it was nothing at all like the description - perhaps it still had the same kind of bread.When I told her I didn't want this new sandwich, she made a big deal out of me being \"too picky,\" and telling me that the kitchen was now going to be mad at her.\"Permanent substitution\"?  Seriously, print new menus and lose the attitude.",

I got a tuna salad sandwich with cheese melted onto one of the pieces of bread. Not much tuna melt action. Eye of the beholder though, I get that.

Fried mushrooms, cheese curds, onion rings--they're all good and don't make you feel gross afterwards like some other places do.The salads are big and hearty. Sliders offer lots of options. And their menu allows you to mix and match things to meet your taste. Personally I like the red pepper gouda soup when they have it and the southwest chipotle chicken salad.

What follows is my progression.My first visit was mostly about the drinks.  I found the beer menu to be decent (which is what I felt like drinking that night).  I know I ordered food and I was not displeased with it.  Overall, my first experience was good and I came back for more.  My next visit included food and drinks.  I went with some sort of mixed drink that tasted fine but was not memorable.  I had the salmon slider to eat.  I did not notice if the menu listed what came with the slider or not, and the waitress did not bother to mention that the slider come with just the sandwich.  When I got my slider I realized that one mini sized salmon sandwich was not going to be enough for dinner.  Sadly, I started eating the slider before I ordered more food.  I can only describe it as a salty salmon puck.  After that, I was no longer hungry, and we went elsewhere.I returned for lunch, and had the BLT salad with the tomato soup.  I recommend both options.  The soup was so good that I came back for lunch again and paired it with the tomato pesto grilled cheese.  This was also wonderful.  In fact it was so good that I found myself craving the soup and grilled cheese one day so I went for lunch.  Now, I am not a fan of swiss cheese which is one of the cheeses in the sandwich.  I requested that the swiss cheese be replaced with provolone instead.  When I got my sandwich there was no swiss cheese, but there was no other cheese on the sandwich.  There should have been American cheese as well.  I guess the server misunderstood my request, and I figured it was an honest mistake so I didn't think it was a big deal.The last straw was yesterday.  I went for lunch again and ordered the tomato pesto grilled cheese with the tomato soup.  Again I requested that the swiss be replaced with provolone.  When I got my sandwich it was more like toast than a grilled cheese.  There was one slice of American cheese and one slice of provolone cheese on each piece of bread, but the cheese was not melty and gooey.  It was toasted and crispy.  Then the pesto was glopped on in one cold dollop.  I found the sandwich to be dry. From now on I will probably only go to this place for the drinks.  Too bad I can find drinks at just about any bar in town.  I feel let down because I really wanted to like this place.  I love the look and feel of the bar, and it has all the potential to be great.  However, if they can't even accomplish a grilled cheese sandwich why would you want to eat their food?",

We didn't feel rushed here.  Didn't feel pressured to drink more, and they didn't blink when our party size doubled and we moved to a different table.  Cons:1.  Small-ish portions:  At $10 for the above-mentioned meal, I felt a little.....unsatisfied.  The sliders seem pricey at  $3+ a pop, too.  2.  Service:  A bit slow.  It picked up when we started strictly drinking, but there was nary a condiment to be found during our meal.  All in all, I'd head back.  It's a nice joint in downtown Champaign.",

The steak in it was so chewy.  I took it off the salad but then the salad was still warm.  It had grilled onions and mushrooms on it which I find odd.  I think it's weird to have grilled onions in a salad.  Maybe it's me but it's just not right.The mushroom sandwich was soggy and not very good.  Actually the mushrooms were just fine but putting it together in a sandwich with cheese and red peppers just didn't do it for me.  They do not go together in my opinion. Basically, I found both items odd.The server was great and the food came out fast I will give them credit for that.  I have been here a few times and this is not a place that I would volunteer up if someone was asking for suggestions where to eat.Some people love it and some people don't.",

Other than that, they have a great beer selection, the cheese plate is absolutely delicious (whatever they do to the bread to soften it up is a masterpiece of appetizer prep, plus each type of cheese on the plate is very tasty) and they play some damn good music. On a Saturday night on the outdoor patio I heard them play The Avalanches, Rob Dougan, Gorillaz, Lindsey Stirling and many more amazing artists that just happen to be in my favorite genre. I don't know if it was a streaming service or a custom playlist but they should continue with it. The wait staff are cute, and they do a good job. I really like Seven Saints.",

I almost expect to get attitude from a server if a two-top asks for separate checks.  It took her awhile to sort everything out, but hey, she asked for it.

Ordered the Cheese Curds as an appetizer, my gf ordered the Tomato Pesto Grilled Cheese and I had the Ribeye Steak sandwich.  We both had two drinks with our dinner...Cheese curds came before the meal and they turned out to be pretty good.  Nothing to rave about, but average.  At last, our meal was delivered.  The bun for my Ribeye sandwich turned out to be what looked like Texas toast.  As I peeled back the bread to look at my sandwich, I was in for a huge let down!  This was the absolute worst excuse for a ribeye steak sandwich.  My biggest complaint, it was paper thin!  PAPER THIN!!!  Literately speaking, my steak was no thicker than a cardboard coaster.  The price tag on this steak sandwich was $10.  This is my biggest pet peeves when it comes to steak sandwiches...I don't mind paying upwards of $15 for a steak sandwich, but I expect good quality!   This was such a poor excuse for ribeye, I had to eat it with the top piece of toast off, just to taste the meat.  How dare they insult their customers with such a poor excuse for a steak sandwich!  My gf equally hated her grilled cheese for reasons she will explain in her own review.Once the check arrived, ($52) we asked to speak with the manager.  We both expressed our concerns with Andy, the manager.  We felt like after spending $50, we should leave the restaurant full and satisfied.  Instead, we were leaving hungry, miserable, and downright insulted!  Andy rattled off various reason as to why my steak might have been a little on the thin side.  He apologized for the size of the steak, and offered us 2 free drinks to make up for our poor experience.  REALLY???  We spent over $50 and all he was going to do was give us two free drinks?  No thanks!  We refused the free drinks, and made sure he knew he just lost two customers for good.I'm not looking for a handout!  I'm not looking for my money back...but the way he handled our situation was horrible!  If a customer spends $50 in your restaurant and absolutely hated the food, two drinks is not enough to make up for this!  I expected a credit or a gift card to come back and give Seven Saints another chance.  Now, I will never be back!  I can find steak sandwiches comparable to the one I had at Seven Saints at Taffies or Steak n Shake!  Keep your two free drinks!  Just know we will spread the word to anyone who will listen!  I hope you handle future situations better.",

If you don't know what that is, then you have to make sure you check out ALL of the discount alcohol nights at Seven Saints because they are all deals you should take advantage of!The whiskey I got was Snake River Stampede. Mainly because I thought it was funny that it was considered a \"rodeo whiskey\" and also that the description for it said \"this whisky can still kick like a bucking bronco when served neat.\" haha.Another nice thing is that they alcohol menu has two featured House drinks and a description for both. This makes it a bit easier while choosing a drink and you don't have to ask the waitress/waiter about every single drink. Even though my server was nice enough to do it if asked.I got the Triple \"S\" Platter (Slider, 1/2 Salad, and a Side). I got the cheese slider, 1/2 Caesar salad and waffle fries. I liked all the food. Their waffle fries were really good.Up until I tried Seven Saints, I only thought of sliders as the little burgers you get from White Castle, but Seven Saints is now my favorite place to get them. I'll definitely be back soon.",

With plenty of space out and inside, and self-seating, the atmosphere is always semi-casual and always welcoming. After looking at the menu, we expected an average dining experience, based on the fact that the menu accentuates burgers (they call their mini-burgers SLIDERS) and salads...not our usual dining-out fare.However...the wings are the BEST WINGS we have ever had in our lives. They are not your usual buffalo-drowned bits of suspiciously massive chook, these are fine specimens of realistically-sized, expertly-cooked bird, served crispy with your choice of two sauces, (there are lots to choose...from BBQ to Thai Peanut and beyond).In ordering, we found that each ordering the Slider/Salad combo worked really well, although sharing sliders and tasting different flavors also works well. There is an extensive beer/wine selection, including some fashionable Spanish options, however we seriously question a wine list without a single New Zealand option, especially in the Sauvignon Blanc section. Our favorite sliders so far have included the Buffalo Chicken, the BlackJack, the California Turkey and the Salmon, although we highly recommend asking for NO BUTTER on the buns if you are interested in 'eating lightly'. Our two salads (Goat Cheese and Spinach/Fried Chicken Salad) were both surprisingly delicious, after so many below-average iceberg salads in the mid-west.All in all, we think they have found a niche targeting people who appreciate casual dining prepared exceptionally well. This is the PERFECT OPTION for those diners who want a home-town up-scale alternative to Ruby Tuesday, Steak n Shake, Fridays, or perhaps even Guido's at the same price and not at the mall!Expect to spend $30 on food for 2 courses for 2 people.",

I have visited this restaurant twice now, both during the week and on the weekend, and have left feeling very less than satisfied.  The building itself is beautiful, the bar is stunning, the ambiance is lovely, (albeit incredibly loud- so dont go in there expecting to have a conversation with your dinner-mates), but the service is unimpressive.  There are certainly quite a few waiter/waitresses around (enough that i have watched them run into each other) but they never seem to come to my table.  Drinks take too long to be made as well as to reach my table from the bar.  I actually watched my drink sit at the waitress station at the bar with the ice melting in it for a while before it was brought to me.  I had the bavarian pretzels, which were decent by themselves, but the jalepeno sauce served with it was chunky and old, and had thickened to an almost inedible point.   As for the sliders, they were nothing special, and I thought, a bit over-priced for what they were.  I wasnt thrilled about the beef the burgers were made with, and it wasnt seasoned at all.   Absolutely avoid any slider with a Turkey Burger inside, it smelled old and.....stale? rancid? The one shining point of my visits, and the only reason this place gets a second star is because of the cheese curds.  The breading was light and crisp, the cheese had substance, and best of all, they were even delicious re-heated the next day!  The sweet potato chips are also amazing.I want to like this restaurant, but I just cant. This restaurant will never be my suggestion for a C-U dinner option.",

My favorites are the Black Jack slider (pepperjack cheese, grilled onions and ancho aioli topped with fried jalapeos) and the Smokey BBQ slider (cheddar, bbq sauce, fried onion ring).  Good stuff.   The lunch combos are a pretty good deal, which offsets the price issue I mentioned earlier.  I usually get the slider + side + salad combo for lunch (which is about $10), and they have other combinations for that.  I've only had the Caesar salad, and it was fine.  Several of my co-workers have had the salmon slider and said it was good as well.I have tried the crinkle-cut sweet potato fries, which were good but not my personal favorite.  The cheese curds are great (as many others have posted), but you do feel a bit of guilt for eating batter-covered balls of cheese.  It's nearly the epitome of gluttony, and you can feel your arteries harden mid-bite.  We did order the Bavarian Pretzels once also and those were good.Service is usually average, at best, but not worth complaining about much.If it's cold outside, avoid the table near the door!   We went once in February when it was still pretty cold out, and even with a large curtain around the entrance way, we were constantly blasted by cold air when people came in the door.  Even in warm weather it's rather distracting.  We've been seated there twice (maybe it's their only pre-setup table for 8).  I'd recommend asking to sit somewhere away from the door if possible.We'll probably go back.  They have enough variety that it's a nice place to go occasionally.",

It's dark: too dark for any food picture. Feels old/vintage on the inside and has a very cool atmosphere.We started with the Bavarian pretzels and a black & blue salad. The pretzels were really warm and tasty, the salad was also wasn't bad, although kind of skimpy on the ribeye pieces. We each got one of the \"pick X, Y, and Z\" combos. I got an Asian slider with the chicken enchilada soup, and sweet potato fries. It was pretty good, the slider was small, as expected, not quite White Castle size or anything though. I really enjoyed the wasabi flavor of the slaw, but felt it needed more toppings. I did order it with everything on a typical burger (lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle) since the top of the menu said those items were available at your request, but I didn't get any of those items when my food was brought out. I did try my Dad's California turkey slider and thought that was pretty good, too. The soup wasn't bad, although it more resembled a chili in my opinion. Crinkle-cut sweet potato fries were awesome! Seven Saints has an extensive selection of alcohol. I really think they are a bar more so than a restaurant. Lots of exotic, small-batch, local, craft, etc. type liquors, cocktails and beers. I had something called a Dragon's Milk, which was an absolutely delicious stout but pricey at $7.50I forgot our server's name but she did a good job!Overall a little pricey for what it is, but I felt the food was definitely a step up from typical bar/pub food. In my opinion, they should diversify their menu by way of adding some non-sandwich options. I must note that they source most of their meet from Old Time Meat & Deli down the street, which is great, knowing things are a bit more local.I'll be back!",

A fairly interesting building.  Some history there.  But if I wanted history, I'd go downtown Urbana, sit at Blind Pig, or the old newspaper.  Favorites!  Seven Saints, as far as I was always concerned, was god-awful expensive.  And for food you could find pretty much anywhere.  Burgers, fries.  Simple standard sandwiches.  Hit or miss, but I'd say, especially for the money, hit up the diner a few blocks away.  You're going to get a much tastier experience, and service with smile.",

The waitstaff is EXTREMELY knowledgable on different liquors and beer.  They are particularly helpful on whiskey and beer, but more than adequate on just about anything else as well.  The only negative thing I can say is they have changed my thoughts on what to expect out of waitstaff, and I have found many other bars/restaurants lacking.The drink list is huge, and new things are constantly being added.  Its very common for there to be a few \"off the list\" specials, particularly on Wednesday nights.  Wednesdays are a great night to go since 1/4 of the whiskey is half off that night in rotation.  I have tasted a ton of different whiskeys I never would have tried if it wasn't for this night.  The waitstaff is always glad to recommend something new based off your criteria, and I have ended up purchasing several bottles from my home bar after trying them at Seven Saints.The food is good, and always comes out quick.  I am particularly fond of the cheese curds, waffle fries, and sweet potato fries.  Most sandwiches are sliders, so don't expect a large sandwich.  They have a deal where you can split soup, salad, and a slider for a good price, that's normally what I choose.  Their caesar salad is great!",

When we first walked in, I wasn't sure if I was underdressed, was it a dinner only place, the dark lighting, the fancy decorations, I couldn't tell.  But the maitre d' was totally welcoming, and when I asked \"Are you food only or can we get drinks?\" he laughed and said it was no problem, and asked where we wanted to sit. We sat at the bar, and the bartender was very nice and got us our drinks fast.  After we sat down, we realized we should have sat outside because of the beautiful weather, but didn't feel like moving.  I didn't look at the food menu, but a few people I was with ordered food.  Unfortunately, 2 of the 3 orders were wrong.  One friend doesn't red meat, and ordered chicken in her salad, only to bite into a piece of steak.  Another friend said her food was just okay.They had some nice beer choices, and after several years in CA, the prices seemed reasonable.  And actually, I ordered a beer on tap that I didn't end up liking.  The bartender saw that I wasn't drinking it, and asked if I wanted something else.  No problems, no extra charges- it was very considerate.  Granted, I should have asked for a taste before I bought it, but I would have eventually drank it.  It was just an extra bonus that I was able to get something else that I really enjoyed.  Overall, a pleasant experience, and I would recommend it.",

They really know their whiskey so this is a great place to try something new of you have discriminating taste. This is possibly my favorite feature of any bar in the area.They always have a nice selection of beer on tap too (at a nice range of prices) and have recently started \"Brewsdays\" with some nice beer specials.Seven Saints has some quality food too. Sliders, salads, sides, desserts... It's all delicious. Definitely try the sweet potato fries or beet chips. My only complaint about the menu is that, since I tend to order vegetarian, the options can get a little stale (though you can sub in a veggie burger on any of their sliders).My favorite meal? California Turkey Slider (sub a veggie burger, hold the bacon), waffle fries, and the Southwest Chipotle Salad.And last, but not least, the atmosphere: Seven Saints feels classy, but not so classy that you'll feel underdressed if you show up in a t0shirt and jeans. It's a darker feel and the furniture and decorations are detailed and thought-out. Even when it's busy, they bar doesn't get too terribly loud so it's great for a date or a night out with friends if you'd like to be able to have a conversation at the table.",

If you are in the mood for that, you WILL have a good time.  But if you want to sit back and have a few beers and talk, then go to Murphys or Legends.Small dance floor that's crowded when a good hip hop or pop song comes on, but the minute they play country or something slow, it gets empty as can be, til the next good song comes on.  KAMS is always filled with student athletes with the throngs of girls surrounding them.  Drinks are cheap - find a frat guy and he'll buy you drinks all night long in hopes you'll go home with him.

A sophisticated, happy-go-lucky crowd draws you in and the fantastic selection of drinks will make you stay.The basement is fantastic for parties and the staff is very knowledgeable.  The free popcorn is of gourmet quality.All in all, Kam's is a wonderful place to bring a date or just have a night of wine-drinking.",

It instills confidence where there was none, and reinvigorates the soul. Now, that being said, utopias such as KAMS can become dystopias if you aren't careful. For one, avoid the basement around the end of October, because it can get pretty scary down there with all the halloween decorations. However when it's not halloween, the basement can be a heaven away from the heaven upstairs.One suggestion is to start serving food. A Blue Boy sandwich, now that is something.*https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brain-babble/201501/smells-ring-bells-how-smell-triggers-memories-and-emotions",

She'd ask, turn around to get them, then turn around and ask what I ordered again...The only plus to this place was for some reason it was loaded with attractive girls (have to imagine it is the cheapest place to drink on campus) and the beer and alcohol was dirt cheap.Seriously, avoid this hole at all costs, or at least bring a clothes pin for your nose.",

I wanted to try them all!Sweet Moses! The only way they would sell me a sausage is if I paid 8 dollars for a \"meal\" and then they would \"add on\" a sausage for another 3 dollars! I saw massive piles of sausage sitting right behind the woman I was trying to order from. I just wanted a sausage or two and was willing to pay a premium for their sausages. But 8  dollars for one sausage?! Come on. This is a classic rip-off! Taking advantage of a community event to make a few extra bucks? Shame. Even the taste of champaign wasn't this blatant. I hope the organizers of Oktoberfest next year  are more judicious in their choice of vendors.",

You find 15 varieties to choose from sourced from a place in California that's the real deal (continental sausage Glendale CA) and the house made sauerkraut has a sharp vinegar bite, which balanced with the fizzy taste of fermented cabbage and is an awesome complement to the tubes of meat. Served with a German style mustard and German potato salad you have yourself an authentic experience.   At a very reasonable price you can have yourself a great German meal compared with the schlep to Gibson city for the bier stube, which is also amazing but pricey.

They have daily deals on drinks and food, changing every day which is really cool and I would go back for the deals. We went on a Saturday which is when brunch is offered til 3pm. I ordered a Cajun omelet. It had this Mexican appeal to it because I got salsa & sour cream with it. And it had a kick. The omelet was large but thin. Not much to it although it was nice and cheesy and that's always important in omelets for me! The prices are cheap too so it works out.",

Whoa!  Great deal and the food wasn't half bad. So why two stars?  They were understaffed that day. That is something that I understand and can roll with. Not a problem.  It took 10-15 minutes before the server noticed my gesturing. Eventually I placed a dinner order.  I had ordered a beer and 15 minutes later I made mention of it to the server. I just thought she forgot. Her response was completely uncalled for. Harsh tone, reactionary word choice, scowl...  I asked the table if I came off rude or something. No, I was apparently quite nice. Not only did I feel like walking out, everyone at the table was looking around wondering what the heck just happened. Someone a few people down said \"oh, yeah. That's why we never come here.\"  We were a polite, hungry, and thirsty group with ages ranging between 20-60.  The staff made us feel like an intrusion as my simple question wasn't the only time we were snapped at and dumbfounded by our treatment. The tip was added into the bill. I still gave her a dollar on top of the included gratuity.  She ended up with a 30% tip from me. That is likely the only time I step foot in that place. I was treated like an inconvenience. Trash.  I would have ordered a few more beers. I stopped at one because of the ridiculousness. Food, drink, and price was great. The staff is the worst. The.  Worst.",

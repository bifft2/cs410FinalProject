But this is night mare for me  I give 1 star cuz chef bring steak back to me. If not, I won't give any thing. And absolutely I won't come back to this place again.",

The beer I had was really tasty as well, had Hale to the Chief IPA and the Eugene Porter, both were good. The porter went really well with the skillet cookie we got for desert. Little more pricey then I thought at first. But would come back.",

However, you have to pay extra for the restaurant to cook your food- ya (which is why I knock them down to 4).  With your meal, you get texas toast, a baked potato, and a salad bar.  So you will have plenty of food.  Never had a problem with parking.  Service has always been pretty good.  Good for groups.  They have some kind of eating contest: I think if you eat their big steak you get it for free and your pic goes up on the wall.",

Wait, restaurant... cook my own food????Me and my dad went here because we were hungry for a steakhouse steak, but imagine our surprise when we walked in and our waitress explains how the restaurant works.  Oh, you can have the house chef cook the steak for you, but its $3 or something extra.... Pretty ridiculous if you ask me...  Well, we didn't come to cook, so we bit the bullet and got the chef to cook our food.  But putting aside the whole \"cook your own steak\" deal, the restaurant was still very poor to me.  The prices are absolutely ridiculous.  Every entree was above $20 and we didn't exactly get a ton of food.  My platter was a medium sized steak, a small baked potato, and a very small serving of veggie mix.  The salad bar was very poor.  Very limited selection, and the food looked old and wilted.  Our waitress was rarely around the whole night, and we even were placed on a side of the restaurant with barely any people.  This was especially troublesome based on how we were never given silverware, needed drink refills, and more napkin quite a few times.  Still, our waitress was never around.  To be honest, most of the people in the restaurant weren't even eating...  It was mostly bar goers and people sitting around for drinks.   Not a good sign for the quality of food to say the least. All and all, I won't be going back here.  Food wasn't bad, but it was very under-portioned and ridiculously over priced.  The service was bad at least on the night I went, the salad bar was very sub-par, and most of the people in the restaurant were just there for drinks.   I can't get into the \"cook my own steak\" deal either.  Hell, I just would have stayed home and made my own steak for a 1/4 of the price.",

The whole \"cook your own steak\" idea is an interesting concept, but if that's what I wanted to do I would buy my own steak (for much less) and cook it myself at home. Pay the extra $3 for a chef to make it for you so you can relax and enjoy your meal. The service is always very friendly and they make themselves available.

We asked for medium and got rare/medium rare which wasn't the end of the world not would that cause me to give a bad review. The disappointing aspect was that the steaks were so bland.  They seemed like good cuts of beef but they were the most flavorless steaks I've had honestly. The baked potato was actually really good yet the salad bar was nothing special. The place seemed okay but was dirty and the lighting was terrible IMHO.  Our waitress was nice and friendly and the service was good from that aspect.  Hard to get over such a bland steak (both the filet which my wife ordered AND the top sirloin I ordered) and dirty restaurant.  Probably wouldn't go back.",

In the middle of the restaurant is a large charcoal grill surrounded by seasonings and buckets of what claims to be butter. Basically your pick out a steak and cook it yourself alongside potatoes and good old texas toast, dousing on the butter as you go. No, this is not health food. They have a variety of different steak cuts, as well as some chicken and pork selections. It's a rowdy crowd and expect lots of drinking around the grill and I had my doubts about sanitation with all the drunken butter use. If you want a backyard grill experiences in the dead of winter, this place is great, but it's very pricey, loud, and I found out the hard way about charges for sharing ($7!).",

And a good trip it is.Alexander's is a bit retro -- a well maintained woodsy interior reminiscent of a forest lodge, brass railings, salad bar, wrap around bar surrounded by people, glowing charcoal pit, caring wait staff, happily chatting customers, and a background sound system you can hear over. The intent is to have a cozy surrounding for folks to gather round the fire, cook their meat of choice, and have a nice dinner together. Kind of like a backyard cookout but with more food, no bugs, no wind.They offer an early bird special menu before 6 PM with meals priced mostly in the teens, including salad bar, a choice of potatoes, and Texas toast. The beef is aged and of good quality. There are also chicken and seafood meals. The main dinner menu offers more choices and meals run in the $30s and up. I chose the Santa Maria Top Sirloin, a 10 oz steak hand rubbed with a proprietary spice mix. It took me a few minutes to remember how to cook on charcoal, but I got the hang of it and the result was a tasty steak cooked exactly the way I wanted it. While I cooked my steak I enjoyed the salad bar. It was fairly small in terms of length, but they packed a lot of goodies onto it, including real bacon crumbles and many other special toppings. Fries were thin in one direction and broad in another. They were clearly cut from whole potatoes and were fried perfectly for crunchy skins, crispy fries, and moist interiors.The bar tender, Hali, was patient with me, explaining how the place works, attentive to my needs (bringing the french fries at the right moment, making sure my drink was in good condition, and that I had everything I was supposed to have), and pleasant.Its sad there aren't many places like this anymore. Its great that there is Alexander's.",

They did have a variety of steaks, along with a couple chicken entrees and seafood entrees. Now, I don't go to many steakhouses, but the $2 upcharge to have them cook my steak for me was surprising. No steak for me. I ordered the shrimp, which came in a huge portion. In fact, they were too big (which sounds ridiculous, but trust me.) I ate 1/2 of the serving and left the rest. They were gummy and flavorless. The garlic toast was greasy and burnt, and if therecwas garlic involved, I missed it. The salad bar was unremarkable, but not bad. My waitress was sweet and attentive, and I was just too tired to complain about the food and wait for them to fix it. On the whole, even if I lived in the area, I doubt I'd go back.",

It's fun once in a blue moon, but I prefer someone to make my steak medium-rare who knows what they're doing. Instead it's me making a ton of incisions in my steak to see if it's done yet. You can pay a little more for them to make it for you though.",

It's not the greatest, but I've had worse. And for okay steak, I feel they are overpriced in general and not just for college students. Their steak challenge is pretty interesting though. If you can finish a 3 lb (48 oz) along with the side dishes and salad that comes with this challenge, you win a free meal. The rewards of this challenge has changed from time to time (i.e. the steak is free, you get a free steak next time, or you get 50% off next time, etc). I've tried this before. It was pretty fun and I got my picture taken and placed on their wall. Overall, Alexander's is a good break from the national chain steak restaurants. You'll pay a little more than you want for some decent steak. Oh and as a warning, if you can't grill a steak, then you'll have to pay an additional fee to have the chef cook it.",

The decor of the place is really outdated, you feel like you went back to the '80s. While the waitress was really friendly, we were not pleased with the overall experience. My $6 beer was flat, the food was really overpriced and you had to pay extra to have it cooked. Yes, if you want someone to cook your food, you have to pay an extra $3. For that extra 3 bucks they don't even have a chef cook, just some cook who has no idea what he's doing. I ordered my steak medium rare and got it well done. The steak itself was nothing special and for a fillet it was pretty fatty. I will never be coming back and will recommend friends to never go there.",

Back when I used to visit Champaign, I'd get invited to go there for birthdays, graduations or simply if you want to grill minus the clean up.As mentioned by Melissa, they do have a variety of steak cuts with chicken and pork. If you're a steak lover, you should be able to find numerous nice cuts if you're willing to pay up. Back in the poor college student days, those nice steaks were difficult to avoid. Anyhow, once the steak had been picked out, you simply place it on the big grill, in the middle of the restaurant and you let it dance and sing. You also have the option of letting the waiters / waitresses to cook it for you. The grill is also used for garlic butter texas toast as well as potato-grilling.Besides the grill, there is a salad bar with a decent variety of salads, ranging from typical greens to creamy mac salads or creamy potato salads.Given a decent list of decent restaurants on the campus of U of I, Alexander's is actually worth while.  I would recommend this place. Hell, go celebrate your birthday or better yet, your A's on your midterm with a nice big juicy rib eye (if you know how to grill) :)",

The inside is very dated, I feel like for as much money they must make off their extremely high steak prices, surely they could invest some back into the restaurant.. but it still looks the same as it did the first time I went probably 10 years ago. I for one don't make a habit of coming here, but it's a popular place for birthday parties and special events so I sometimes have no choice. It is unique but if I wanted to grill my own steak I would go start my own grill in my backyard and save about 20 bucks. The meat selection is good, and the cuts are definetly the weight you pay for if not more. The worst part of this place is simply the insane price for a steak you cook yourself.. the salad bar not being all that great (the lettuce was very low and picked over quite a bit when I was there), and the fact you are sweating when you get back to the table from standing by a hot grill for the past 15 min cooking your steak. It is a cool place don't get me wrong.. and the food is good.. just can't justify the cost.",

The starter fig pizza with prosciutto was crisp and tasty. We ended up sampling each other's dishes including the seafood risotto and fresh pastas. The most outstanding was a real gnocchi, light and fluffy paired with a scrumptious lamb Raghu that melted on the tongue. For dessert, creamy cappuccinos and a steamed bread pudding worth dreaming about. Beyond that the staff was gracious and warm. A perfect lunch. Thanks Timpones!",

I've been here a good number of times over the years, and every time was an enjoyable trip, except once. I took someone here on a date, and we were seated in an area where the lights weren't working and the speakers were broken. I'm guessing they figured they could just put students there and get away with it. I complained (the restaurant wasn't near full and I had placed a reservation), they were nice about it and moved us and the rest of the dinner went very well. The decor leaves something to be desired, but otherwise a solid restaurant, with decent service and good food.",

The food was really good, the service was excellent and it had a nice cozy romantic feel.  It was, however, pretty expensive, particularly for being located on a college campus.  The food was fantastic but portions were on the small side, especially considering the prices.  The peach bread pudding was scrumptious.  I probably won't be back, not because it wasn't good, but because there are a lot of other upscale places in town I'd like to try before I break the bank at Timpone's again, and special occasions that warrant a $100 tab only come along so often.",

Well, I ordered the papardelle with the bolognese. Being a bolognese snob (and believing very sincerely that the best bolognese I've had was made by yours truly), I have to say it was certainly up to my standards. In addition, I had a slice of my neighbor's margherita pizza which was also tasty. I've not been to any other Italian restaurants in town, but this is Chicago-quality stuff right here. While it's a little on the expensive side, it is finer dining. It's not somewhere I'd expect to go every day for lunch but it would be nice for special occasions, dates, etc.",

The dining room is upstairs and is nice enough in a traditional way, but the look and ambience are very dated.  The quality of service is not in line with the menu.  Our server was clearly overwhelmed.  Our table had white linens bespeaking of a \"nice\" restaurant but was set improperly.  Wrong silverware, no bread plates.  We sat for quite some time before our drink order was taken, then our waiter left in the middle of taking the drink order to serve food to another table.  He eventually returned to take our drink order and then asked us for our entire food order at the same time.  Bread service was slow though the bread was good.  The glass of riesling we ordered was clearly from a bottle that had been left open for too long.  Another glass from a fresh bottle arrived after a while.We ordered some salads to start off the meal.  The bistro salad looked great - field greens, asparagus, potato, poached egg, bacon, vinaigrette.  However, when the salad arrived, there was no bacon.  Ahem.  \"Excuse me, but our salads have no bacon.\"  Response: \"OMG, forgot the bacon.\"  Instead of taking our salads away and giving us new ones, we were given small bowls of bacon pieces to put on the salads ourselves.  Please.We ordered a wild mushroom pizza with sausage and gorgonzola but we wanted to substitute goat cheese for the gorgonzola.  We were told this was not possible.  Restaurant policy is no substitutions, just subtractions.  We could remove the g-z but could not add goat cheese.  We ended up using the build your own pizza option and built the pizza we wanted.  What a pain in the a**!  The pizza was delicious though.  The thin crust must be one of the best I've ever had.The entrees were generally very good.  The American \"kobe\" skirt steak was tasty, having a sweet marinade reminiscent of Korean kalbi in flavor.  The duck breast was well prepared.  The trout was overcooked but was still edible.The desserts were adequate and there is a good selection of after dinner drinks and dessert wines.In summary, Timpone's has an identity crisis.  If they want to serve this type of food, then there is a level of service that is expected to go along with it which they did not meet.  It's hard to enjoy any restaurant when you are unhappy with the service.  My recommendation is to go for the pizza - then you won't need a bread plate.",

It's decent enough upscalish Italian-American food, but location is the only reason I go there --- places like Radio Maria, Cafe Luna, or Milo's have quite a bit better food.

My boyfriend and I went here for a nice post-valentine's day weekend dinner (we knew it wouldn't be too busy this weekend, so we opted to do our v-day dinner this weekend instead.) When we walked in, the door and sign were very old-looking, but in a charming way, so that was promising.The first floor is a little more laid-back, but they say you can go to the upper floor if we'd like, so we opted for that. It was very nicely decorated with sculptures, paintings, and plants. The other diners were dressed casually, but still nice, if that makes sense. Like, jeans with a button-up or nice sweater. It was quite nice up there and the service was lovely. I ordered the veal and it was absolutely delicious, and the perfect portion size; however, it was not the perfect portion size for the price. For a $29 entree, I expected a little more on the plate, or for the price to be lower for the same amount. None the less, the food was delicious and so was my boyfriend's. We ended up sharing the crme brle for dessert and it was very good.Overall, the staff was very attentive and helpful. Although the atmosphere was slightly intimidating, it still had a nice, cozy, fancy-restaurant feel, and I wouldn't mind going again.TLDR: It's a nice place with good food and service, but expect to shell out some dough.",

Local ingredients are very exciting to me and we've never been to Timpone's. I hear a lot of mixed reviews, everything from \"I had food poisoning\" to \"It's my favorite place when I have a special occasion\". Needless to say, we were excited to give it a try. When you walk in, you must go upstairs to be seated. After being seated, we enjoyed the Italian themed \"high art\" that was so popular in the 80s while we chowed down on a tasty meatball appetizer. We debated the ethics of charging the measly $1 for the bread starter. It was our locally inspired entrees that were especially disappointing. After a long decision making process, I went with the $25 halibut. It came with gnocchi and assorted vegetables. As I ate it, I felt like the fish was a little dry and overcooked and I noticed hints of freezer burn - yuck. After tasting all the components of the dish separately, I couldn't figure out what the culprit was. All I know is, it would hit me every now and again. My boyfriend's dish was the poussin (a baby chicken). It was super tender and was served with a farro pilaf. While it was tasty, the sweet sauce they smothered the chicken in made you feel like you were eating General Tso's chicken. We decided to try the apple crisp for dessert which was amazing! Little cranberries help balance out the sweetness. They did that annoying thing where they garnish it with mint even though there's no mint in the dish.In the end, I'm thinking maybe it was a mistake that we ordered off the special menu. Perhaps their typical Italian American cuisine would be better. From what we experienced, we definitely felt that the dishes were overpriced for the quality. We spent $100, and left feeling like it just wasn't meeting the quality we've seen at other places nearby. For $100, you could have a perfect meal in downtown Champaign. For $50, you can go next door and have a pretty awesome meal too! I'd like to come back and try the regular menu but, I'm not in a hurry to come back and spend the kind of money they're asking for mediocre food.",

The biggest plus for me, aside from the food that is, was the waitstaff. All of the servers were very friendly and professional, and I could tell they all looked out for each other. Case in point, I noticed some lint on one of my glasses of wine, and before I could even say anything, one of the other waiters saw me studying the glass and quickly came over and offered to replace it.Speaking of wine, the selection was great, but I was unfortunately relegated to the limited \"wine by the glass\" menu since I was the only red wine drinker at my table. Even so, the selection of wine by the glass was well-rounded and pretty solid, and our waiter's wine recommendations were spot on. Now, for the food!Bread and olive oil is complimentary, of course, and very tasty (so simple...but so good!). For starters, we ordered the crab cakes as well as a spring salad with walnuts and gorgonzola, both of which were very good. For my entree, I had the roast duck, which came with fingerling potatoes, red cabbage, spring vegetables. The entire dish was fantastic. Moist duck, perfectly cooked vegetables, and a wonderful sauce that had blueberries in it. A simple dish done very, very well.In all, Timpone's is a great place for a gourmet meal at a pretty decent price. They have a nice selection of veg-friendly dishes, too (not vegan, however). I can't recommend this place enough. Give it a try!",

I don't know where they get their seafood, but the swordfish is the best I've ever had.  Also pastas, steaks, and great vegetables - they are committed to organic ingredients.  Spend a few hours and taste a few appetizers before dinner.  Reasonably comprehensive wine list and full bar.  Cordial service, but they keep it leisurely, so let them know if you've got a curtain later.  The owner comes around to make sure you feel well cared-for.Note: they serve lunch M-F from 11:30 until 3.  Dinner begins at 5 p.m.",

We ordered the mushroom pizza as an appetizer, the steak burger (cooked perfectly medium and only available on the lunch menu), mushroom ravioli, and the spinach tagliatelle with chicken. The menu changes often and I've been there multiple times and enjoyed my experience/meal. Definitely a special place to take out of town guests but we also enjoy it for a lunch or dinner when we're feeling fancy! I do agree that the portions are on the smaller side compared to other restaurants (of lower quality) but I feel very satisfied after because the food is good quality and delicious.

The food is vaguely Italian with some American influences, and it's pretty good overall if not mind-blowing. Last time I was there I had the tuna burger, which wasn't bad, although I was a little disappointed when the tuna turned out to be a tuna patty and not an actual piece of tuna. They give you free bread... nice. Friendly service too. I just wish the food were a little more impressive.",

We witnessed multiple tables of college aged valentine's dates (and some older folks too) sharing one dinner or actually walking out before ordering because they couldn't afford it.  Our waiter was HORRIBLE.  He had an incredibly loud voice and though friendly enough, was not really \"nice restaurant\" material. For example: instead of \"may I offer you more coffee sir?\" he said, \"do you want more coffee?\" (in that really loud obnoxious voice--think yelling)....  I mean, I am not snooty but it's Valentines and we are trying to be romantic on a night out so a little politeness could go a long way.  I could hear his voice across the dining room.  He actually called out one of the couples who left before ordering---saying \"Sorry Guys! You know the menu is really good and if you were in Chicago, you would pay $150, etc.\" I mean, he kind of went on and on....really loudly...and you know these broke college kids were just trying to sneak out of there with the least amount of embarrassment.  Geesh! HE was horrible.  Did I say that already? and we had to ask for everything- bread, refills, etc. nothing was anticipated---he was just bad.  The price is steep- especially for Champaign- but it was a holiday so the splurge can pretty much be justified.  Portion sizes were very big and good.  Food was hot and perfectly cooked.  They didn't accommodate vegetarians well- as we overheard at the table next to us----the veg options included the Chilean Sea bass without the Chilean Sea bass---so just basically the sides (what? Like, have a pasta dish, it is an italian joint after all). We had a decent date---would have been great if the waitstaff were better.  Would probably go back.  I think they should consider some new staff though.  :)",

My most recent visit, however, made me appreciate this place all the more.  I can't say that I've had a better pasta with bolognese sauce.  Sure, it's a seemingly absurdly simple dish, but everything about the thing was just right.The wife got a fried oyster and spinach salad that was extremely delicious as well.  I kept meaning to ask what sort of oysters they were, because you don't typically see consistently small oysters like that.

The white wine I had was also very good. I was too full for dessert but wanted to try the lemon tart so I ordered it to go. I figured I could have it later while I worked in my hotel room. I was surprised when I got my bill and saw that I was charged .50 for the container b/c I asked for the tart to go. It's not a big deal but after paying over 60.00 for my meal (for one), this left a negative impression. I've gotten dessert to go at other restaurants of all different price ranges and have never been charged for a container. I wonder if I had eaten part of the tart at the restaurant and then asked for the rest to go if they would have still charged me the .50.

We were both really pleased with the meal and I hope he takes me back there again sometime.",

                "review": "The atmosphere: The downstairs bar area is small and cheap looking. The dining room is dated and screams \"cheap 1980's supper club\" - not at all romantic! The restaurant was filled with retirement-age couples/parties about to head to a Krannert performance on the Wednesday evening that we went. This past week, we went to Timpone's to celebrate my birthday. We started off sharing the \"Fritto Misto\" appetizr, described as \"Calamari, Gulf Shrimp, Scallops, Red Onion, and Zucchini.\" When the dish arrived, it was nothing but a pile of glorified onion rings. There were only three pieces of calamari (small tentacles), 3 shrimp (which were small, and clearly of the phosphate-pumped Asian variety, and a scattered few wet calico scallops...95% of the \"Fritto Misto\" was red onion. I feel as though by listing the seafood first, that indicates that the bulk will be seafood, or at the very least, there will be an even distribution of the components. Not wanting to be a \"difficult customer\", I chalked it up to just a \"bad batch.\" That being said, the recipe was a straight copy of Judy Rodgers' dish in the Zuni Cafe (San Francisco) cookbook, and I could have made it at home...However, when I received my entree, \"Sea Scallops with a Dijon Beurre Blanc on a bed of celery root puree\"... I was furious. There were 5 scallops, each approximately the size of a quarter (no exaggeration) and only seared on one side. The mound of puree could not have been more than 1/2 cup (and didn't even taste good). My husband ordered \"Chianti-Braised Shortribs with Homemade Gnocchi\" - which came with fewer than 10 small gnocchi. Worst of all, the food tasted bad; the beurre blanc was so sweet it was like Creme Anglaise with Dijon and I could have done a better braise at home easily.  I know that times are tough, and that food costs are supposed to be ~30% of the final restaurant price- but I felt completely gouged. I'm happy to pay for a delicious meal and I do not expect large portions. I travel pretty frequently to Chicago and DC- I know what good food costs and what \"normal\" portion sizes are at \"fine dining\" restaurants. I did not want to make a scene because I didn't want my husband to feel bad for picking the restaurant. The only reason this place could possibly stay in business is because of its proximity to campus/the Krannert Center for Performing Arts or because most people have very low expectations due to the lack of \"Fine Dining\" in the C-U area.Our server was very attentive and great, but the food was so bad (even with the small portions, we didn't finish our food and didn't want to take the leftovers home!). We will not be returning.",

The beef tenderloin was way above its price range for the amount you get and there's better out there. Overall, my experience was pretty bad...The creme brulee was the only thing that was worth praising there, although it is a tad too sweet for many of us.",

I'm also a fan of the dim lighting in the dining area and the overall quiet atmosphere so you can actually have a conversation with the people you are having dinner with. We both ordered pizzas, which they claim is one of their specialties, and it was good, but I felt like it was also a little over-hyped because it wasn't anything extraordinary. The ahi tuna appetizer was delicious though and I would highly recommend ordering it. Overall, it's a nice restaurant.",

Picture a midwestern take on a NYC restaurant, circa 1980's (though a little later 80's now since they did some updating).  The menu, though printed daily, doesn't stray far - pasta, some fish options, sometimes steak, risotto.  Service varies, and unfortunately there is a lot of server turnover.  I have eaten here many times b/c it is close to areas of the University in which I work.  At one point this was a bit of the \"make the scene\" place, and it is convenient for pre- or post-concert dining at Krannert.  Nevertheless, many other places have come along since this one, and while I would say it's in the top handful of places in town, it is no longer at the top.  I would also recommend lunch over dinner...very similar menus, and I tend to get better lunch service.",

And there wasn't much flexibility there, either... I mean, it's not like you could order and they'd deliver.  But you could pick-up, so that was something.My favorite, by a landslide, was their Italian Beef, but it, too, wasn't that dependable.  It really just hinged upon whether you liked thickly sliced garlic.  You could always tell when they got down to the bottom.... besides the beef getting a little fattier, there were so many pieces of sliced garlic, the whole texture/taste changed.  Enough garlic to keep ten Dracula's at bay, I assure you!Their expensive sub-par pizza was soon replaced by Ozark.  A happy day for all those on the South Campus.Honestly, we had to depend on this place for so many years, and I just always found their food \"meh\", and their \"service\" even worse.  Unfortunately, their prices were the biggest insult... When the new place was built across the street, we were all glad.If you're looking for a very dated restaurant, with a menu that's reflective of its age, give this one a try.

I have eaten at top rated (over priced) steakhouses and I was in the mood for some good midwest beef and something on the 'local' side. I had a GREAT dinner experience. I really enjoyed the ambiance of the place, the U of I memorabillia is very cool (I am a sports fan) and it has a nice feel to it. The service was more than attentive. Had a really nice glass of wine. Ordered the Ribeye dinner, medium rare and it came with bread, salad bar and baked potato. All for under $20, food only. I travel, try to get this anywhere - you won't find it. The salad bar is nice, for me not that big of a deal. The little loaf of bread is a nice touch. But when the steak and potato arrived on a sizzling hot plate, oh yeah this is what I wanted after traveling all day. I ordered the steak medium rare and I will have to say that it was cooked to PERFECTION. Just the way I wanted it. The potato was tasty and large and I just sat back and enjoyed a very nice meal. I would definitely eat here again, I would recommend others to do the same.",

The food is one step above a sizzler and the prices are that of medium to upscale restaurant. Over time I've began to realize that some people don't know what good food is...now without calling me an A-hole, hear me out. Everything is bland and unseasoned here; steaks are traditionally brought out with the texture of shoe leather, God forbid there be any juice left in the steak. Salad bar is eh, it's big and if big means good then I guess it's great. As one person posted before it will probably be gone in 10-15 years when a majority of their patrons have passed away, though I would like to say they are probably right, there is a new crop right around the corner that will still view the ribeye as a special treat. You don't have to reinvent the wheel but for Petes sake if you are going to specialize in steak serve a great steak (I'm looking at you, Beef House, as well). Eat what you like, I'm not going to stop you, but if you are seeking out a decent steak in Champaign the best place I can suggest is Roadhouse and I'm ashamed to do so-",

I grew up (and never really left) C-U, so the Ribeye will always hold a special place in my heart for its sentimental value. The decor hasn't changed in 20+ years, I'm sure. When you go in there, you feel like you are transported back to the 80s. However, the restaurant itself is very clean. The salad bar is my favorite -- always fresh, crisp and cold. I can't overstate the freshness -- you constantly see employees changing the salads. All of their salads and salad dressings, to my knowledge, are made in-house. I'm a huge fan of everything on that salad bar, especially the cucumber salad and the herring salad (but you just might have to be Eastern European to appreciate pickled herring with onions in mayo). For being a Ribeye lover, I actually don't like the steaks at the Ribeye. I really like thick-cut steaks cooked med rare, and you will never get anything below a med well steak at this place. However, the steaks are always juicy and full of flavor. They're served on a hot skillet (which I find questionable, but again, it's part of the experience). I always get the grilled chicken with extra barbecue sauce. It's seriously the best out there. I don't like twice-baked potatoes anyways, and their's is no exception. I usually order steak fries or rice pilaf.They have drinks, but they appeal more to the older crowd. No biggie for me, I usually order iced tea or wine anyways.I wouldn't say any food from the Ribeye is out of this world, but it is very, very good. The quality of the food and service is consistent. Go in with an open-mind. The Ribeye hasn't changed a bit in decades, and there's always a wait -- there's definitely a reason why they haven't changed. They do what they do very well.",

Personally I like it better when I'm not picking up the bill.The main dishes are right there in the name - different sizes of rib eye.  I'd heard great things about the salad bar, and it is pretty good.  There's a lot of x salads - pasta salad, bean salad, egg salad offerings.  The vegetables are reasonably fresh and there's a fair amount of toppings.  Even so, this is not a good place for a vegetarian.  My girlfriend's family took us out to eat here and one of her sister's friends was a vegetarian.  She had very little luck with the menu and I think had to get the salad bar only.  The rib-eyes are meaty and well cooked, not too overseasoned.  They come out on a hot metal plate that will continue to cook them a bit as you eat.  I have ordered rare steaks each time I've been there, and they actually brought out properly rare (chill in the middle and bright red) so I didn't mind too much.  It was moist and delicious.  The steak fries are big and crispy but just a little bland to me.  The price does seem a bit high to me when paying, and the decor is absolutely outdated.  A lot of the popularity of this place is rooted in nostalgia, I think, but it delivers the Rib eyes it promises.",

The place is dark and windowless with (rather tacky) Illini sports posters on every wall/surface.The salad bar, which some people rave about, is not particularly large and is poorly designed/located so that you often have to go down both sides to get what you want...which is a lot of trouble considering the offerings.The steaks are OK, but thin for the price and always overcooked. The shrimp is OK, too. The bread, which looks/feels fresh baked tastes like its stale and probably comes from frozen dough.The only nice thing I can say about the place is that my parents like it.",

Ok, you people need to get out of central Illinois more....So here's what this place is about.  It is called The Ribeye and that is a perfect name for it.  Just about the only thing you can order here is a ribeye.  You can get an 8 oz ribeye, a 10 oz ribeye or a custom cut ribeye in any weight up to 32 ounces.  But you can't get any other cut of meat.  All ribeyes all the time.  They do have I think one chicken and one shrimp dish available if you don't like ribeyes.  So you better like ribeyes if you come to this place.Now to the salad bar.  What is good about it?  The fact that they have iceberg lettuce, cucumbers, croutons and 8 different mayonaisse based salads?  The salad bar is terrible.  Where are the mixed greens or spinach?  What about garbanzo beans or sprouts or candied walnuts or jicama or edamame or anything remotely interesting?  I find rural midwest cuisine sorely lacking in variety and this salad bar is just about as vanilla as it gets.Lack of menu choices, a terrible salad bar, baked potatoes that only come with butter and sour cream options (a steak restaurant should ALWAYS have baked potatoes that come with the options of chives, bacon, cheese and ALL of the fixings) and a pretty dingy interior all leave you pretty underwhelmed with this place.  Unless you want a 32 ounce ribeye.  Then they've got you covered!",

I was surprised that the restaurant was only open 5 and half hours every day and close by 9 or 9:30 every night. Weird concept for me... they would definitely receive more business by staying open a little later. We did not make a reservation and walked in. Quoting us a 20-25 minute wait while there were four open tables to be seen we decided to wait and eat here. Seeing we were not leaving, the hostess seated us within 8 minutes. This was a Friday evening.Our waitress was extremely pleasant and took great care of us. We ordered a beer on tap and of course, the ribeye. Ribeye comes with choice of baked potato, steak fries, or rice and each couple gets a loaf of bread. Salad bar is free if you order an entree. The salad bar was great, but way too small. It had plenty of food but it was crowded with a lot of people on both sides reaching everywhere. It needs a different spot in the restaurant. I ordered the 8 oz. ribeye while my husband ordered the 12 oz. It was a good cut of meat and well-aged but it was just good. I expected my mind to be blown, but it was just a good cut of steak. With two steaks and two beers our bill was $55. The restaurant looks like something from the 70s... very odd, but comforting in a way.",

Seriously, have you never been outside of Champaign and seen a real salad bar?  Hell, even the Courier Cafe in Urbana has a better salad bar!Our waitress--and I wish I could remember her name-- was excellent, but she couldn't save the meal.DISGUSTING.",

                "review": "Every now and then, you find a restaurant that does one thing and they do it so well that they never need to change. This is not that kind of place, although it thinks it is. The menu offers three options: ribeye, chicken, or shrimp. Seeing as they specialize in ribeyes, I would think they would know how to cook one. I ordered mine medium, expecting a juicy, pink center. I ended up with a very well done steak that was mostly devoid of flavor. Part of the problem is due to the fact that the steaks are served on a hot skillet-plate, which obviously continues to cook the steak as it comes out to you. If you plan on ordering a steak here, I recommend asking for it rare so that by the time it arrives at the table, it's not completely over-cooked.I understand that the salad bar is a big draw for some people. There is a huge selections of different \"salads\" that you might find at a church potluck (i.e., all sorts of salads that involves pasta, mayo, and other things that are not lettuce). If you want a lettuce salad, there is a large bowl of crisp iceberg with tomato slices carefully arranged in a cylinder, stacked like citrusy bricks. I imagine the baked potato is fine, because you can't really do a whole lot to mess it up. I ordered the steak fries, which weren't seasoned at all. One of my dinner companions commented that they tasted a lot like the frozen french fries that you bake in your oven at home. The decor was hilarious incongruous with the prices. From the look of the place, you'd think you were at a small town seniors restaurant that served plain chicken with a side of canned corn. Then you look at the menu and the three dinners cost between $16-23. It didn't bother me a lot, but it was amusingly awful in terms of ambience.I don't mean to trash this place too much though. The service was great, and the staff were very accommodating. I was there for a graduation party, and I called in advance to see if they would allow me to bring in cupcakes. I've seen other Champaign-Urbana restaurants add a plating charge for any outside food, if they allow it at all. The Ribeye said it was no problem. I have to give them props for being cool about everything.Overall, I can't really recommend this. You can get a mediocre steak for a lot less. If you do end up going, just make sure you either order the steak less done that you want it, or be very clear with the waitress as to what medium or medium rare means to you (and be prepared to send it back). Oh, and don't order the fries!",

If you rolled in looking for other options on the menu, be aware the menu is simple. Other members of our table had the shrimp and chicken and gave it a good rating. Now onto the decor... if you like the 80's this is your hot spot. Overall a decent meal and good service.",

Because Ribeye has many happy customers, as well as fellow Yelpers who are fans, and who are marking Ribeye higher, I will try to describe Ribeye as well as I can as I relate my single dining experience. That way, you, the reader, will know what to expect if and when you go.Ambience and Decor:Let me first describe the restaurant's ambience. The restaurant is a dark, windowless interior space. The decor is simple, something like wood or wood-like tables and chairs along with booths. When I was there the restaurant was very busy and extremely noisy. TV's were visible from most seats of our table, so watching a TV show or event while eating is part of Ribeye's draw. I imagine drinks and dinner while watching a football game would be an example. There is a full bar in a space connected to the dining area. Food:The food at Ribeye is not to my taste. The ribeye steak is low quality meat. Eating the steak is not a pleasant or satisfying experience. Perhaps a hamburger or meatloaf type order would be safer. Ribs are on the menu but I just know that the barbecue sauce would not be better, and might be worse, than that offered by McDonalds.The salad bar comes with most dinners. The salad bar has a mediocre selection of items, and the quality of each item is basic. Coleslaw would be on par with that available in a chain supermarket deli. Freshness of the salad bar is variable by item, depending upon how it turns over. Overall, the salad bar is not worth ordering. It just is not very good.Bread is a hot, fresh loaf, but mediocre nonetheless. Also, Ribeye does something to its butter. The butter is whipped up for sure, but they might add sugar or something to it. The vegetables, and items like baked potato or mashed potatoes are edible, but mediocre. These don't appear to be prepared to order. Unfortunately, potatoes and vegetables lose much of their appeal if they are not eaten when freshly cooked to order.I can't comment on dessert. None of us ordered dessert, and I don't remember what was on the dessert menu.Summary:Overall, Ribeye leaves me with the impression of being an upgraded (albeit, a much upgraded) version of Sizzler. It also has the feel of a sports bar. Prices are pretty much in line with what Ribeye offers. That is, prices are neither too high nor are they particularly good values. Service is adequate but unremarkable either way.For me, this all is about 1 1/2 stars on Yelp. Ribeye is targeted to, and evidently, successfully fills, its own niche in the market. The other reviewers have different opinions, but all of us are evaluating the product that I have tried to describe to you above, in my review. I hope this will give you some idea of what to expect if you visit Ribeye.",

The small loaves of bread were hot coming to the table.  I had one slice - average. The best thing going on was the salad bar and even it lacked. By that I mean the lettuce was tired. However a good variety of other things were there. Large portions - that's the best I can say. And that it was walking distance from the hotel. But if it's meh, who cares?",

The game is pretty simple and it cuts all of the crap that you get from hotel staff trying to be overly friendly. Ask \" Where would you go tonight if cost didn't matter?\" And if that doesn't work ask \"What restaurant is your favorite?\" \"What would you get?\"First time out of maybe a hundred i didn't get a good recommendation. The staff is very friendly so I gave two stars, but when I go somewhere for food I want good food. The quality of the steak is on par with almost expired meat from walmart. Harsh but true. I feed my dog steak once a year for his birthday and the low grade steak I get from my butcher for him is better than this. Also I am glad that I read some reviews on here before I went because they serve the steak on a frying pan that is cast iron and very, very hot. The result I ordered my steak rare expecting it to come out medium rare it was closer to medium and by the time I was finished with a 12 oz. it was going towards medium well. The salad bar was the only redeeming quality. It had a fairly decent selection of different salads; such as pasta salad, potato salad and so forth. The basic salad is a kind of build your own house salad with a few simple dressings and a large variety of toppings that are typical in the Midwest. (Sorry reviewer from Cali I know people from Cali and they are always disappointed by our smaller selection of vegetables offered for vegans in Midwest restaurants)The price for a 12 oz twice baked potato (mediocre and two hot to eat because it was served on a skillet so it didn't cool down) and a sprite. 29 bucks before the tip. This is DEFINITELY a favorite of the locals because of all of the Illini stuff on the wall but the rest of the decor was just covered up fake wood paneling from the 70's/80's will black painted drop tile. In short, find somewhere else there are plenty of places to eat in Champaign/Urbana.",

The Ribeye has a relatively limited menu and their specialty is the ribeye (surprise, surprise).  The salad bar and baked potato are included with the ribeye dinner, and both are pretty good.  The overall ambiance of the Ribeye is relatively casual, and they have a lot of Fighting Illini memorabilia.

I've had 15 minute waits even with a reservation, and 45 minutes plus without. I don't believe they take any reservations on Saturday, so expect a wait. Ambiance/decor isn't the best, sure, but it serves its purpose. The clientele is comprised largely of older Illini fans, so it works for the Ribeye to have pictures of Illini teams from their glory days. The service here is fantastic. The servers are professional, polite, friendly, and attentive without being overbearing. About the food... Well, when you go to a place called \"The Ribeye,\" you should probably be in the market for a ribeye. Sure, there's chicken and shrimp, but the ribeye is their pice de rsistance. Honestly, when I started going to the Ribeye around 5 years ago, I feel like the steaks used to be higher quality, which is what keeps me from giving them a 5. Still, the ribeye is brought out on a hot cast-iron skillet/plate, and that sizzle alone can make my mouth water. I recommend either ordering one degree of cooking lower than your normal preference (i.e., if you like medium-rare steaks, order rare) to compensate, or eat your steak as soon as it's served. The highlight for me, however, is the salad bar. There's iceburg lettuce and the standard salad toppings to make your own,  or an array of pasta, bean and potato salads (most of which are, indeed, covered in mayonnaise). My personal favorite is comprised of green peas, peanuts, cheddar cheese, bacon and ranch dressing. Is it haute cuisine? No. But it is solid, simple, and delicious. Also awesome - the croutons, made from the leftovers from the fresh French or wheat bread brought to your table.The price isn't terrible. Two people with soft drinks and before tip comes out to $42. The Ribeye isn't world-class, five-star dining, but it does offer good steaks, great salad options, and pleasant service.",

                "review": "Ahh, The Ribeye, a University of Illinois post game tradition.  I am assuming it is a post game tradition because most people have imbibed before, during, and after the game and need the Ribeye's bland food to stay in their stomachs.  I am only halfway joking.       My SO and I went to the Ribeye recently on a Saturday night and true to course, it was packed.  Even with the full house we did not have a long wait.  The clientele was a mixture of older couples and slightly depressed game goers.  The interior of the Ribeye is straight up old school steak house, dark and dated.     Like prior reviewers have noted, the Ribeye is famous (or infamous) for its very small menu: ribeye steaks, chicken, and shrimp.   They charge you $1.50 per ounce after $23.99 for a 10 ounce ribeye so it makes it just a little more expensive than going to a chain steakhouse restaurant.  They do have a salad bar that is included with your dinner.  It is not a huge salad bar and only has the basics for salad toppings.  It's meh ... I was impressed to see spiced apple rings on it though.  I had not seen those things since the grade school cafeteria!     The server we had was very friendly although she was busy and did not offer a refill or any suggestions to go with the meal.  I will chalk it up to being busy although she did take time to chat up the U of I game goers at the next table.    I ordered a 8 oz. ribeye rare with sauted mushrooms and loaded baked potato.  SO ordered the 10 oz. ribeye medium rare with steak fries.   It did not take long for the entrees to arrive on sizzling hot on plates like a fajita.  The sauted mushrooms were canned button mushrooms in a weird wine sauce and swimming in oil.  They were not bad, but they were not sauted.  My steak was medium rare but it's hard to cook a steak-umm rare.  Seriously, my steak looked like it belonged on a Philly cheesesteak. I did not mind the fat but the lack of any type of seasoning was ridiculous (salt & pepper should be requisite seasonings!).  If you want to be known as THE steakhouse for the Champaign-Urbana area, maybe you should invest in some quality steaks and not truck stop steaks. My husband enjoyed his steak but he had just recovered from the stomach flu so I am not sure his experience is valid.  SO's steak fries were okay, again no seasoning and my baked potato was a baked potato. Sour cream is fully loaded here and you have to ask if you want extra butter other than the one that comes with the tableside bread.   Disappointed in general and completely confused as to how people consider this a great steakhouse. Pros:   Nice service, kind of cool retro atmosphereCons:  Bland over priced food, over inflated reputation",

The wine list is basically two choices:  white or red.  The menu is basically two choices:  steak or chicken.The steak is a decent cut, but hardly seasoned and served on hot cast-iron skillets that mean your medium-rare steak is well by the end of your meal (and your medium well is a dried-out hockey puck of jerky-like ribeye.)All this while dining in a windowless cinder-block building decorated wholly in orange and blue, and surrounded by senior citizens (equally decorated wholly in orange and blue.)But yes, the salad bar is good.",

Noticed there were quite a few people already there. We were told they would let us have a table as long as we could eat and be done by 6:00. That not being a problem we were promptly seated. My daughter and I usually share a meal and I asked our server if that would be OK. She told me that the kids buffet was only $3.00 so we opted for that. And she certainly ate her worth of $3.00 salad bar and more. When will it stop snowing here????? Anyway, I ordered the 10 oz. Ribeye medium. When it came out on the sizzling skillet it was more like well done. It was hard to cut and totally dried out. My server noticed that I wasn't happy and offered to get another one. I am not one of those people who likes to send food back to the kitchen for obvious reasons but this time I did. She brought me back that best Ribeye I have had in a very long time. When I cut into it bleed and that grosses me out but here the skillet is still cooking the steak and therefore it was soon medium and perfect!! So, my advice would be to order your steak under what you would at other steakhouses. They make the ranch dressing and that is always a plus in my book. The salad bar was good. They have real bacon bits. That along with homemade ranch dressing is the best in my book!! By the time we left there were so many people waiting to get a table it was crazy.  I advise go early (they open at 4:00) or make reservations.Yes, they only offer Ribeye steaks. No deceiving there. Hence their name,",

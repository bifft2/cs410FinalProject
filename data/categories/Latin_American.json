The great service continued with a friendly and efficient bartender, who can make a good martini (you'd think that was easy,it's not).   We had the guacamole app and it was fantastic!  I will go back just for it.The atmosphere in the lounge area was calm and quiet (no tv's or rowdy people).Will go back for dinner soon.",

We entered the restaurant and the place was packed. It was about 6:30. We didn't have to wait long before they offered us a table in the bar room. The ambience was nice and the food was delicious.Our wait staff was a little slow and it took them a while to come around to refill our water and our bread basket, but the entree and overall experience made up for it.I ordered their white sangria. I must tell you that if you like sweet and fruity drinks, definitely order it it. It was so good that my friends decided to order it as their second drink.For our food, we decided to start off with the Coconut-crusted shrimp with orange-jalapeo dipping sauce. It was pretty good. The best part was the sauce.My entree, I ordered the Phyllo-wrapped lamb loin filled with goat cheese, rosemary, and coriander, served with red-skin mashed potatoes and port reduction. It it a mouthful to say and I must say that it is worth every word. The lamb was cooked perfectly and all the sides were very complimentary. I would definitely order this dish again.Overall, I give this place an A. I would definitely go back to try all the other dishes on their menu.",

Service: Decent and attentive once we flagged someone down and asked to talk to someone about ordering! It took them about 5 minutes to get to that point.Appetizer: We had the morrocan-style mussels; probably the only well-seasoned dish of the night. Tasty, but not the best I've ever had.Entrees: The seafood paella is not a paella; its a bunch of seafood in a pot, with rice and sauce buried at the bottom. It was a beautiful presentation, and the seafood was cooked well but woefully underseasoned. None of the sauce touched the seafood, and the sauce was sub-par at best. It's Latin American food, right? Seasoning?!The phylo-wrapped lamb is an inventive dish, and beautifully presented. I think their chef went to beauty school, not culinary school. Again, underseasoned and the glaze seemed to be missing something...salt probably. Drinks: The mango margarita tasted like it was laced with lighter fluid or nailpolish remover. Their wine selection was really good.",

Meat dishes like the Hanger Steak Asada and osso bucco contained tasty prepared meat that was very tender to the fork and deliciously prepared vegetables and potato on the side. The seafood dishes like the sauteed shrimp and scallops and seafood paella also contained nice large juicy pieces of seafood, although only a few pieces. The rice on the paella as surprisingly flavorful although a little wet. The crema catalana I tried was also prepared very nicely with a crunchy caramelized sugar top over tasty custard that wasn't too thick and tempered with just the right amount of citrus. Overall, the food texture, temperature, and flavor was great -- however the small portion sizes for the price make me hesitant to award the final star.",

For the entree, I had the chicken mole.  The waiter described the mole precisely which was excellent since it was the sole reason for choosing it.  However, the sauce was poured over a very small half chicken with skin and bones resulting in little meat and lots of picking through the skin and bones to find said meat.  The fresh squeezed limeade could have used more lime juice.The restaurant itself is comfortable and inviting.  Service was excellent.",

We got there before the dinner rush and there were several empty tables so we were seated qucikly.  The waiter came to our table right away and told us about the specials etc.  We ordered drinks and our dinner and still the resturant was not quite half full.  We waited for our meal as the resturant filled up.  We knew it would take a little longer than chain resturants as the food was cooked to order and that was ok, but 50 minutes late we were still waiting and realized that most people around us had their meal already. that was about the time the waiter came up to let us know the \"computer had eaten our order and it had been so long since it took the order he forgot what we'd ordered\"  We should have left at that point, but didn't, and re-ordered.  There was no rush placed on our dinners as people who we heard order at that time got their food just before we did.  In all we waited an hour and 20 minutes to get our food.  Before the waiter told us our order had been eaten the service was great and glasses were kept full, after that we only saw him when we got our food and check.  I sort of expected them to discount the meal.  We'd put almost 2 hours on the meter (as the lot was full) and barely made it back before our time expired.  I'll probably go back for lunch, but I doubt they will make the cut for dinner again :(",

This was my first trip to escobar but middle son, who had been there before, refused to go because he claimed the atmosphere was too uninviting.  This was unusual for him to refuse to go out because he is a serious boy-about-town and never misses an opportunity to experience anything.OK, i'm sorry to say the aesthetic sensibilities of my 12 year old are a bit more fine tuned than whoever designed the interior of this restaurant.  It's all hard surfaces so the feel is very cold and extremely loud.  I asked my husband twice throughout the meal if he would be mad at me if I asked the people at the table next to us to stop laughing in such an annoying pitch.  Since he reminded me that i am not Larry David and nobody would find it funny, i refrained.  onto the food.  we had a spinach salad with mangos, shrimp, cucumbers, and red onions in a citrusy dressing.  this was good.  definitely fresh.  then we had a grouper over rice with veggies...eh, it was ok.  very large portions as in enough to feed 2 hungry adults, which worked well since we shared everything.  the fish was very fresh though so i give it 4 stars for that.  then we ordered coffee and bananas flambe.  the coffee had to be sent back because it was so weak and instead we ordered espressos.  i rarely ever send anything back probably because i hate wasting anything, but this was reeeeeeeeeeeeeally bad coffee.  Our waitress even agreed that she has to doctor her coffee when she drinks it here due to the weakness.  But the bananas and the caramel sauce...now that is worth 4 stars.  Would i go back?  No.  Should you try it?  Yes.  There seemed to be a lot of people there having a good time, laughing loudly.",

As is the case with Milo's, the dressings on the salads were divine.  Escobar's is not cheap, so minus one star, but it's a great destination for those special evenings when you are willing to spend some money on a nice meal out.  The white sangria was particularly noteworthy.My complaints would be that they were stingy with the bread.  They only gave us three slices of bread, a boring white and wheat and then some sort of corn foccicia thing that was really good, but two of us had to split a small piece so I really didn't get to enjoy it.  Also, on the jicama orange salad I had, they served the orange in slices rather than segmenting them.  This meant chewing on nasty orange membranes instead of simply enjoying the lovely combination of flavors in the salad.  I know it's probably more labor intensive for the kitchen, but when a diner pays $7 for a salad, you need to segment the damn oranges.  Overall though, these were really small things that really didn't damage my overall enjoyment of the evening.  My entree and dessert were absolutely wonderful, and the service couldn't have been better.  The food wasn't spicy at all, but was still very flavorful.  I personally would like to see a little kick added to some of the dishes, but it would be icing on the cake and they are fine without it.All in all, I really enjoyed my dinner at Escobar's and plan to go back.  It's not cheap, so I won't be a regular, but I certainly plan on coming here for birthday dinners and the like.",

It's nicely done but unpretentious. The wait staff was incredibly friendly. Refills were quick in coming and we got our food very quickly. As you waited you are served a basket of various tasty breads.We started with the coconut shrimp. It was absolutely delicious with huge, perfectly cooked shrimp covered in a tasty coating. The coating was very light and wasn't as sweet as some coconut shrimp can be (I think that was a plus) and it was served with a slightly spicy sauce and and a small bed of greens, onions and mango. The flavors were spot on. You only get four shrimp total but the shrimp are quite large and it was a good size portion for an appetizer.I had the chicken mol for my entree. Finally I have found a good mol in Champaign! I seriously had given up hope of finding a decent version of this sauce here, let alone an excellent version. I've tried just about ever mol sauce in town and it's almost universally bland with little more flavor than the sauce black beans are canned in. But this sauce had a great smokiness, a slight cinnamon undercurrent and the perfect amount of spice. It's served over two large pieces of chicken, still on the bone. The chicken was wonderfully cooked. The presentation was also a plus. It was served with Mexican rice, black beans, cooked fresh vegetables,  a fresh salsa and two large plantain chips all on a banana leaf-covered plate. The portion is nicely sized. Every element of this dish was superb. I really cannot find a fault with any of it and everything went so well together. The vegetables were even cut beautifully!My dining companion had the lamb dish and from the bite I had it was phenomenal as well. We finished off the night by sharing the chocolate-covered orange cake with raspberry cream. I would probably be a little afraid of how something like that might turn out if the meal I'd had wasn't so delicious. The desert did not disappoint.It's not a cheap place to eat dinner, although I took a look at their carry out lunch menu and they had some really great options all in the $10 - $11 range. And sometimes you really do get what you pay for.",

The food and service is both great. I usually get their salmon dish (it seems to change a little bit each time) and it is always a winner because it is not dry but not too moist. I also tried the carne asado (medium-well) and it was also a wonderful dish with tortillas, assorted veggies, and rice and beans. Their beer selection has some variety in case wine or sangria is not for you and if you are sick of the usual suspects. I have gone here three times and it still never disappoints. This one is a winner indeed.",

I called back a week before we went to make sure they didn't screw up our reservation. They assured me that the reservation was still there.Well, it wasn't. They screwed up our reservation, and we had to wait till 9:10 pm to be seated. The group ahead of us, who DIDN'T make a reservation, got a table before us. I asked if there's a point at all to make a reservation, and the owner stuttered. The owner then attempted to seat 5 of us at a small table meant for 4 at most which I thought was a little ridiculous. Being a server myself, I could've found a better spot ESPECIALLY when there's an empty 2-person table that could easily be joined to my table. FYI, the place was busy, but it was NOT packed since it's 8:30 pm on a Sunday night. The also had a special graduation menu which is almost identical to the regular menu but pricier. Food was good, but not great. We got 2 appetizers and 5 dishes, and we all sampled each other's. I liked the duck and the tilapia entree the most. I don't think anyone liked the chicken with mole sauce at all, but at least it was tenderly cooked. I got the red sangria which I didn't really like, but my dad did.This place didn't blow me away like I hoped it would. I've had better food in Champaign.",

However, this was met.2)  I want my water full.  I rarely order drinks at restaurants, but I do want my water to be kept full at all times.  This too was met.3)  I want the food to be at least as good as I could make at home.  It's common sense, but I hate paying $20.00 for a plate of something that I could have made better for $5.00.4)  I want to leave feeling that I got my money's worth.I found all of these things at Escobars.  The food was great, I had NO complaints.Mmmm...",

The chef poured the corn cream sauce on half of the talapia. A simple and wonderful idea that let us enjoy the dinner in different ways. The side vegetable mix was great too. Obviously cut and cooked right before the meal. The better half had a steak with a port reduction sauce. Same fresh vegetable mix. Note, I mentioned to the waitress I do not like peppers. Without asking she made sure there were none in my dinner vegetables. Good, thoughtful service. Wine menu was OK, but would not stop us from coming back. Easy parking. Outside seating.",

They also own Milo's in bufu, Urbana but as Escobar is the chef, Escobar's is his place.I always have a good time with their wine staff, especially the lovely salty gal that has only been tending a short while but swigs wine like a sailor, which is to say she doesn't take a dainty white-glove approach. She's a no-nonsense, straight-up pro that can take in a mouthful of wine and nail the flavor notes without all the swirling and sniffing and sloshing. It's the only time I've been able to say, \"this one tastes like a chewy, sweaty S&M jock strap\" and have someone know exactly what I mean without further explanation. And despite the fact that she's a beer girl, her vino recommendations (granted the list is not as extensive as other places downtown) are excellent.I've done a few different things on the menu but I always go back to their duck a l'orange. The meat is always cooked to succulent perfection and maybe it's because everything on the plate is a shade of orange but the entire dish tastes juicy, earthy, bright and warm. Like 6pm sunshine! Like it's made from Care Bears! I want to liquify it, put it in an IV and jack the whole tasty lot right into my veins!The mussels are excellent as well and my friend scarfed the ceviche on our last visit (I had my face in the mussels - so much for sharing).The bread is baked in house and they have a bombin' spicy corn focaccia so it's easy to load up on table bread guilt-free because you can't nosh on Escobar bread anywhere else but Escobar's.Most importantly I like this place because the food is so good and the staff is so nice that it doesn't need all the flash and glam of other restaurants to earn five stars on yelp! The closest comparison I have is the cluster of restaurants out in Napa: sun-drenched, family-owned, friendly and in an epic love affair with food. Outdoor seating means gazing into a parking lot as cars zoom by but it is still the only place in Champaign where I am a little saddened at the end of my meal because I don't have four stomachs, four wads of cash and four hours to sit and eat four more servings of Escobar's duck a l'orange.",

She was clearly on a diverse mix of prescription meds, because she had a hard time communicating with us.  The food was cold, because she brought it out one plate at a time for a group of 6, and proceeded to talk our face off as we were about to leave, despite being cold and indifferent during the rest of the meal. A little training might be in order here. Maybe you had the B-team on staff for Easter - but y'all need to check yourself before you wreck yourself.",

The waiter was very personable and helpful with suggestions and descriptions of dishes.  I started with a limeade, and my mom and sister had coffee -- a fantastic blend developed at the Columbia Street Roastery (which is next door).  We were served cornbread with orange zest mixed into the batter.  It was a little bit sweet for my taste (but I tend to prefer more savory cornbread in general).  We ordered platanos fritos, which were subtly spiced with cinnamon, and served with black beans on the side -- they went together surprisingly well.For brunch, I ordered the California Benedict -- avocado, asparagus, and a poached egg atop an english muffin, covered with a chile-spiced hollandaise sauce.  It was quite good -- I thought the little zip in the sauce complimented the eggs nicely, and helped to engage the palate more.  I was told that the crab cake sandwich and the salad with egg were delicious as well.  All told, we had a great meal -- the only complaint I have was that they did not serve all of the entrees at the same time (although the delay was not long, it did serve to make the eggs Benedict a little lukewarm by the time we all started eating).Anyway, to sum up, the atmosphere was nice, the prices reasonable, the service generally good (and always pleasant), and the food delicious -- I will definitely return here when I come to Champaign again!",

The fish tacos are the bees knees and when they have the seafood paella on the menu it's arguably the best dish in town.

My favorite is a shrimp and scallop lemon cream sauce dish. The merlot braised short ribs are also pretty awesome. Their white sangria is pretty tasty but maybe even a bit too sweet for my tastes. This place is a bit more expensive than your standard restaurant in Champaign, but it is definitely worth it, if only for a treat every now and then. This place has excellent food and the amount is usually more than I can eat in one meal anyway. I love the way the inside is decorated - it feels very festive without being too obtrusive.Also, Escobars is just fun to say.",

Three things that can spoil my dining experience is bad food, bad service, and bad atmosphere/lighting.  At Escobar, the food and service is good and the atmosphere in the dining room is decent.  But the bar... I couldn't wait to leave. I experienced the very same thing at the sister restaurant Milos where the entire restaurant has horrible lighting.  The food and service was wonderful, but because of the atmosphere/lighting, I never wanted to return.",

The place was recommended to me by a friend as being one of the better restaurants in Champaign, and the menu online looked interesting, so I decided to give it a try for dinner. The restaurant is really big and was pretty empty when I went (around 8pm on a Tuesday night). After pigging out on the complimentary bread and drinking a mango margarita (tasty if a bit too sweet maybe), I started with an appetizer of fried calamari. I should better than to order seafood in the middle of Illinois: it was certainly not terrible, but it wasn't great either... a letdown for the calamari lover that I am. I then ordered the duck breast: the duck itself was not very good (not very tender and slightly overcooked), and it came with steamed vegetables (boring), mashed sweet potatoes (not bad but a little plain), fried plantain chips (good), and roasted pears (definitely the highlight of the dish: these were actually quite delicious). Overall... not a terrible entree but still quite disappointing and a little overpriced. To their defense, the portions were very large and I was completely stuffed by the time I left the restaurant. Friendly service.",

The busboy also kind of tossed/threw the bread bowl on the table which was weird and definitely made me raise an eyebrow.We ordered the guacamole appetizer and a caesar salad to start; my boyfriend ordered the hanger steak and I got the mushroom enchilada.  The guacamole was pretty good and both of us really enjoyed our entrees.  However, the salad failed to come and our waiter only noticed it once he brought over the entrees.  We still got the salad but it was pretty bland and unexciting, despite the enticing description on the menu.The worst part of the evening was the service.  Even though our food was good, we could never find the waiter to refill our water or order dessert.  He took so long we ended up deciding not to get dessert at all.

Usually we order wine or beer, but this time got our mixed drink on. She had a super strong sangria that was good once you had a couple of sips and I had a Capirinha (sp?), which tastes like a Mojito w/o the mint, but with tequilla instead of rum (I know its not tequilla, but that is what it tastes like). Anyway, that was really strong, too but was not as tasty as their spicy Bloody Maria that followed.Service was spotty for us. Our server probably should not have been assigned our table, as she was busy with a private party in a special room they have. She did not make it up to us in the al fresco dining section as much as I would have liked. However, she made up for it with a comp on the Bloody Maria, so its all good in this hood.The food was great. We had an app of their stuffed pupusas, a great vegetarian dish that is bready goodness just bursting with latin flavors. I had the enchiladas and she had the pork tenderloin. Both were fantastic and big enough for lunches the day after. Since we were on bikes, they were able to wrap the dishes up extra careful for my backpack, and they made the trip back to Urbana no worse for the wear.BTW- There was an obnoxious 40-something biatch next to us getting all nasty with her server about the (extremely moderate) amount of spice in the food. Its not too spicy. If you are think Escobar's is too spicy, then you will never know the joys you are depriving yourself.",

Escobar's is a gem. I consider it one of the finest restaurants in the area. Escobar is extremely knowledgable and creative in his presentations of Central American cuisine, and the prices are half of what you would expect to pay if you read the menu without the prices.I've eaten here dozens of times, both lunch and dinner. I've never had a bad experience with either the food or the service. House baked rolls or muffins, sometimes sweet, sometimes savory are delivered to your table first off. Then there are several specials of the day. The service has always been prompt and attentive, whether I have eaten alone or in a group of up to twenty people. The first time I had the roast chicken with mole, I was floored. It's very difficult to roast a chicken and have the light and dark meat be perfectly cooked. Escobar's does this, and the mole sauce is spectacular.For lunch I tend toward the sandwiches. The shrimp po' boy (which I order on Cuban bread) is excellent, with black bean corn relish and herb aioli. The Guatemalan Torta is a perfect blend of ingredients. I can't recommend this restaurant highly enough. Better hurry, though...Escobar's lease is up in January 2017, and he's decided to end the business unless he gets a sale offer. That's a pity.",

Plus, all entres but one came out at the same time, and it took more than five minutes for the last to show up.  I hate when they do that... everyone who has their food wants to eat it but feels they need to wait, and the one person who doesn't have their food is left feeling guilty and telling everyone to start.  No thanks.Also worth noting:18% gratuity for parties of 5 or more, \"for our convenience. \" Really?  I've never seen this for under 6, and usually under 8.  This is so they're more sure to get a good-ish tip because they're planning on the party being difficult because of its size.  5 people is not difficult, suck it up.$4 Split plate charge.  Really?  This is not a hoity-toity enough place to pull this off, even in Champaign.  Thanks for putting it on the menu, though, instead of trying to sneak it in... at least you're broadcasting your shortcomings.-Overall, given the weird choices they make, the good-but-not-great food, balanced with the meal prices (most hovering in the $20 entre range), it's solidly a two-star experience.

I was wondering if she would turn her plate over and make a face. Thank goodness no childhood flash backs cropped up for her.  My brother in law is strictly carnivore.  I was impressed that everyone found a dish.  Well done Escobar.  Oh, and I recommend a mojito if the weather is warm or maybe if you just are wishin warm breezy thoughts.  Ha ..If somehow you find they don't have them available..go home and have one ..they make family time much more tolerable.",

Although the dipping sauce sounds hot, it wasn't. It was more of a citrus and jalapeo flavor and it complimented the coconut shrimp quite nicely.  We tried the hanger steak fajitas for our entree.  It's a good thing we were able to split the entree as it would have been way too much for one person.  The steak had a wonderful mole sauce with a little kick. And the vegetables were not typical for fajitas.  Asparagus, carrots, onions, red & green peppers.  Also had a side of black beans and rice with black beans.  The regular margarita was one of the best I have had in a restaurant.  The menu is seasonal and changes quarterly, so you may or may not be able try something that is suggested in the reviews.  Timing is everything! I would definitely go back when I'm visiting Champaign.",

The calamari wasn't the traditional type you'd get at mainstream American restaurants but it was thicker pieces of squid with panko breading. This non-traditional set-up was quite good although the sauce that came with it could be a little bit more tangy. The Moroccan beef soup was very good, beefy but not overbearing. For the entrees, I ordered the Phyllo wrapped lamb and she the duck roast. The lamb was excellent, it came wrapped in a flaky Phyllo pastry and a succulent sauce. The sides were also superb, although I could use a little less garlic in the mashed potatoes. The duck was cooked to perfection, although the plantains and mashed sweet potatoes were left a lot to be desired.We shared dessert, which was the banana flambeed with vanilla bean ice cream. It was amazing, although it is quite hard to mess up something so innately satisfying. Overall, the presentation was superb and the waitress courteous. The atmosphere was fine for the occasion, although my girlfriend did complain about the \"orangy\" walls... haha. In any case, I highly recommend Escobar's for a good meal.",

A basic principle of good resto services is to avoid gratuitous meanness, even during ebertfest. I'm a local, love their food and won't go back. People deserve to be treated with basic civility, esp when they are civil to you. The second waiter's apology later sounded a bit more genuine, but not enough. Goodbye Escobar's.

I was in the mood for Latin-type food and found Escobar's. The boyfriend and I left work around five and arrived at the restaurant around 5:30. I was expecting to be one of the first tables being that it was early. When we arrived there were already 5 or 6 tables seated, I took that as a good sign. We were promptly greeted and shown to a table. We were brought water and bread (delicious, by the way) and within a minute our waiter was at the table greeting us. As we looked over the menu our waiter described the special of the day and gave information on the many delicious sounding menu options. My boyfriend loves calamari so that was a no-brainer for the appetizer. He is pescatarian but the wild mushroom enchilada struck his fancy. His review: The enchiladas were delicious. Most places give you three smaller ones, here you get one large enchilada with a generous amount of filling. The sauce that covers the enchilada has a nice (not overpowering) bite to it. My food: AMAZING. I had the seafood paella, half a lobster, shrimp, and mussels. The lobster and shrimp were perfectly cooked and seasoned well. Some of the mussels were a tad overcooked but based on the rest of the meal I was willing to overlook this tiny misstep. The waiter was well on his game, eyeing our water glasses from across the room and bringing more before we even emptied the glass. We will definitely be coming back!",

                "review": "Escobar's might be the best restaurant in Champaign. The atmosphere is cozy and comfortable. The wait staff has always been pleasant and attentive. And the food is almost always impressive. I'll acknowledge other reviewers who gripe about the time it can take to receive your food. Going to a fine restaurant should be an event, not something you rush through. It's an experience. I've never found a meal here to take longer than similar fine restaurants. A typical meal at Escobar's might last roughly 70 - 90 minutes if you get an appetizer, entree and dessert. Not unreasonable at all, but maybe a little longer than a meal at Chili's, for instance. ;-)As for the food, you'll be served a small basket of assorted breads once seated. These are always fresh, delicious and unique. Some sweet, some savory. I never know what kinds we'll get, and I always get a little bit excited to see what will be in there. Please excuse my nerdiness. Below is a rundown of some of the dishes I've had at Escobar's. Appetizers: Coconut crusted shrimp - fantastic. The shrimp are enormous and perfectly fried. Served with a delicious orange-jalapeno dipping sauce.Duck confit taquitos - a taste sensation, but at $10 for just 2 taquitos, it's a bit of a splurge. Almost an amuse-bouche than a true appetizer. If there were 4 in an order, getting this would be a no-brainer every time. House made guacamole - a huge portion of freshly-made guacamole, served with a heaping pile of warm, roasted tortilla chips. This is a favorite when I come here. Entrees:Filet mignon and andouille sausage kebobs - my new favorite dish. I have never had such tender, melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon in my life. The andouille sausage was a nice, spicy accompaniment. Huge portion. Absolutely delicious. Phyllo wrapped lamb loin - a bit overrated. The phyllo was a little burnt when I ordered this, and there wasn't much of a sauce. Crab cakes with guajillo cream sauce - O.M.G. The crab cakes are light, flaky, fresh, and this guajillo cream sauce - a bright orange sauce, takes this dish to a whole new level. Spicy, smokey - it's a heaping forkful of warm love going in your mouth every few seconds. Love. Sauteed shrimp and scallops - a forgettable, bland dish - and the scallops were gritty (my worst nightmare whenever eating scallops). One of the few disappointments I had when dining here. They do have a small dessert menu. Mango rum cheesecake, lemon curd pie with berries, flan (I never knew I liked flan until I tried it here!). Dessert portions aren't too big, nor too small. The perfect way to end a fantastic meal. Again, service has always been friendly and attentive. Once, we were not waited on for about 10 minutes after being seated. When our waitress realized her mistake, she offered us free soup to make up for it, and gave us excellent service during the rest of our meal. She went out of her way to make it up to us, and we appreciated her enthusiasm. One of my favorite restaurants in the C-U area!",

Last time I went with my lady friend on Saturday before Valentines Day.  Made a reservation which they screwed up and stuck us in a corner four-top while several other more cozy two person tables sat vacant during our whole meal.  Menu was special for valentines day and had several options.  I chose tilapia and my girlfriend got the filet.  Being a wine couple but not familiar with many wines from outside the U.S. I asked for a rec from the server who admitted to having no idea on wine pairing and left to go ask someone.  Even at biaggis their servers are trained in that.  Very disappointing at a higher dollar establishment.  Remainder of meal not impressive.  Tilapia was average and would agree with some of the other posts in that it was too much food and not enough contrast in flavors.  I forgot to mention the coconut shrimp app we got that was also disappointing.  No coconut flavor at all.  Too full for dessert.  Filet that I tried nothing special either.  For my money- Radio Maria, Milos when it was in Lincoln Square(haven't tried new location), even Jim Goulds.  Just so much better service, ambience, and food selection and quality to come back here again.",

It was pretty empty in there, but it was sort of after the lunch rush and it was during the week.  We promptly were served ice cold water and some delicious banana bread muffins with butter for free.  I ordered a freshly squeezed limeade, a nice twist on lemonade.  My friend and I both agreed on getting the Cuban sandwich.  So many different flavors playing into this sandwich.  Sliced ham, a deliciously marinated shredded pork, Monterey-Jack cheese, pickles and a whole seed mustard topped off the sandwich served on baguette bread.  My friend commented on how he doesn't usually enjoy mustard but really enjoyed it on this sandwich.  The sandwich was accompanied by a side of mixed greens in a vinaigrette and some sweet potato fries.  Sweet potato fries are always an A+ in my book and the mixed greens were a good add too.  The fries and salad weren't anything to get super excited about, but definitely yummy and helped fill me up for sure.  Left there with a whole other half of my sandwich and one of the muffins. Lunch is extremely reasonably priced and although I understand it to be a little more expensive for dinner, I can't imagine being disappointed from what I saw from this meal.",

I was down visiting my daughter and she chose a winner!Escobar's has a very inventive menu with a fusion of many latin tastes with its own Ol added to the mixture.  We had the fried calamari for our app, something I would not expect in a Latin restaurant but it was delicious with one heck of a tasty sauce.  I had the Cuban sandwich for my main course and it was crunchy with all the distinct flavors you expect in a Cuban sandwich but with their own version of it.My favorite two beverages in the world are freshly brewed iced tea and bottled Mexican coke and they had both.  Hard choices that are great either way are part of what makes this such a great place.It's more expensive than your typical Mexican restaurant because it is so much more and quite frankly, aren't you worth it?",

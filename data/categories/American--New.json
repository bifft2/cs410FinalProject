They only have a few beers on tap (bud, miller coors, fat tire and guiness are all I remember) however there are two pages of wine selections.  Seems like they might be shooting for an older crowd.The food was decent.  I had an order of hot wings, which were average, and a \"build your own\" burger.  The build your own concept is nice, but that is the only option.  It would be nice to have some \"already assembled\" burgers to choose from.  My wife got the ruben, which was horrible.  We sent it back and the manager told us there had been a lot of complaints about it.  The service was ok.  They forgot to put in the wings order and we were comped a drink.  This sort of thing happens in a new restaurants I guess.  Overall I think I would give them another chance and hopefully they get their shit together.",

Upon pushing through the masses and finally making it to the bar, I ordered two ciders, one for my boyfriend and one for myself. The bartender said confirmed I wanted hard cider and poured something from the tap i was unfamiliar with. I just assumed, because I hadn't specified, perhaps he just chose one i didn't know. But it was ale. I hate ale, it makes me vomit. It would have been a pain to push back through the crowd to correct his blunder. So, the service is disappointing and the bartenders cannot tell ale from hard cider. Pity. I don't see any reason to go back, for food or other visits, if they cannot even get a simple drink order correct.",

We thought this was going to be a fun, new place to take him for his birthday dinner.After standing by the door for about 15 minutes because there was no \"seat yourself\" sign and no one was by the little desk, we finally went into the restaurant and realized it was seat yourself, although it was a Saturday night and with 6 people it was petty hard to find a spot. Our waitress was just the worst, and she never told us her name so I can't even mention it. She came to our table TWICE, once to get our orders and once to give us the bill (after we had to track her down to ask for it). When the other workers brought the food out they brought them out at different times and my sister's boyfriend never even got his. After having to track down random workers to get the food (it ended up being wrong anyways!) and to get sour cream, SILVERWARE and other things we were all just laughing at how bad our waitress was. We never got any re-fills on our drinks and when asking how much the vodka sprite was no one could even tell us. Overall this place was super disappointing and we all couldn't wait to leave.",

Clean, family friendly including some arcade games to entertain, plus hidden pool tables, dart boards and a nice lounge area in the back. Generaly, just a good location to hang out and relax with a group of Illini sports fans.Agree with a few reviews that the relatively small draft selection (13 when I was there) conflicts with the name of the place. This is not a brewery. :)",

Halfway through the game our waitress comes over to tell us that they can no longer serve alcohol because their liquor license expired. She told us we could finish our drinks that we had already purchased, but she couldn't serve any more. She suggested we come back on Monday...it was Saturday night.  I am not sure how a situation like this happens.  If your main business is beer, wouldn't that be something you would be aware of? Moreover, how does the license expire at exactly 9:15pm? This was my first experience here, and while I would consider coming again, it wouldn't be my first choice.",

It was awkward because there wasn't a waiting list when we came, it was still \"seat yourself\" so when a table cleared up we tried to sit down but a server told us it was already \"claimed\" and then suddenly there was a waiting list. Why not just have a waiting list and a host at all times? Seating yourself doesn't really make sense in a restaurant this big.I understand this is a new place, but the servers and bartenders seemed to have little knowledge of the menu. My mom ordered wine 3 times, each time it came more than 10 minutes after she ordered it and the wrong wine was given to her... The third time the correct wine finally arrived (after she changed her order to an easier, more recognizable wine) but by then we had finished our meal and were ready for the check...The food is pretty unimpressive as well. The \"salad\" my sister got was just lettuce with a few nuts tossed on top of it. The nacho appetizer, on the other hand, was delicious.The bar and atmosphere of the place has so much potential, and it's a great location, but the service and food were simply a let down.",

It's big enough that you don't feel bad taking up a table for a whole game and the servers are totally cool with you staying until the end of the game (we continue to buy drinks after we eat, so that probably helps).The decor is really nice and it's a very comfortable restaurant.  My concern is that it is SO big I'm not sure if they'll be able to stay in business because besides it being a really good place to watch a game, the food is just okay.I've had the Orange and Brew Beef sandwich (just ok) and the Buffalo Chicken Wrap (good- I'll probably get this again).  Both came with the crinkle cut fries that another reviewer wrote about (probably were frozen, but I enjoyed them).  My husband had the pizza (just ok) and the BLT (just ok).  So, out of the four things we've tried, we'd probably only order one of them again.  Not great.Regarding the beer selection- yeah, it's not that exciting, but I think the name \"Orange and Brew\" is more of a tribute to the Illini than it is a reference to their beer selection.I would love to see this place re-vamp their menu to be a little more interesting and maybe not so big- maybe pick a theme?  I think they're going to have trouble staying in business if they don't.",

                "review": "While I'm tempted to give a 1-star review for the experience, I would bubble it up to a 2-star based on the atmosphere.  The restaurant is deceivingly large and nicely decorated, with adequate parking, a good sports bar feel, clean, and not overly loud.  Now, the volume may have had something to do with the fact that there were only 3-4 tables and about 4 people at the bar, but nonetheless it was a comfortable volume. Unlike the situation mentioned from an earlier reviewer, there was a prominently placed 'seat yourself' sign at the entrance.  There was very few people at tables, so we sat near the bar.  It was a weeknight but a home basketball game but there was no discernible pre-game crowd.There appeared to be 3 bartenders working and a significant number of waitstaff; about one for every 2 people in the restaurant.  Our waitress introduced herself promptly and took drink orders.  Despite there only being four of us and being seated literally less than 10' from the bar, it took about 10 minutes to get an iced tea and 2 beers.  As noted, for a restaurant with \"Brew\" in the name, the beer selection is poor.  Upon taking our orders, waitstaff disappeared to parts unknown, only to be seen fleetingly like timid woodland creatures, and we were forced to resort to a combination of primitive hand signals, napkin semaphore, and pointed looking around to signal our desire for service.Meals arrived after about 20 minutes less one salad, to which the waitress commented \"Oh yeah, that's weird.  Do you still want it?\"  Beverage refill and reorder took an additional 10 minutes.  One of the party was having wings and we requested a couple additional napkins, which she brought after being reminded once 7 minutes later.  Burger was mediocre, smallish, and dramatically overcooked.  Wings were small and undersauced but had decent flavor.  Pub chips were soggy and so oversalted that they were nearly inedible.  Quality of food was somewhere south of Buffalo Wild Wings.Overall, terrible service which seemed more like an honest cluelessness about what services a waitstaff should be providing, mediocre food, poor beer list, but a cool area.  With all of the other options within a couple of miles, if there is not an immediate improvement in service level, quality of food, and beer list i can't see this place lasting.",

All in all you leave a little underwhelmed. Pizza and wings have been the best of the items I have ordered.Not a huge beer selection (for a place with \"Brew\" in their name\") as they only have 6 or 8 on tap. The beers they do have are quite good and they have decent week-day specials but it still leaves you wanting more.Service has been hit or miss. I have had one GREAT server and a handful of not-so-good ones who didn't know the menu.The best thing Orange and Brew has going for it is its setting. Their space is beautiful with incredible TV placement (and lots of them) to ensure you will always be able to see the game. They have an awesome space that you can rent out with pool tables, a lounge area, and foozball. If you are looking for a solid, new place to go to watch a game or have a dinner with friends, Orange and Brew is for you but I would encourage you not to have extravagant expectations.",

Not to long after, our orders we're taken which took about 10-15 minutes to come out.  (NOTE this was a Monday night and not very busy). I ordered the fish and chips.  Pretty decent.  The chips are the crunchy homemade style which I would prefer over greasy lays with my 10.00 meal.  My daughter got Mac and cheese which looked like kraft...but 99% of restaurants serve that kind on their kid menu, so that didn't bother me and she was satisfied.  The bar manager did come over and check on us which was nice.  Overall I would say I enjoyed my visit, and would definitely go back again.  I did take into consideration they have only been open for what ...a month ...so they are prolly still finding their nitch, but if they do fix the kinks this place could be a fun place for a game night in.",

I can't speak to the food, but a friend ordered a meal and was promptly served and she seemed satisfied. There were a bunch of people around watching games on tv so it wasn't as awkwardly empty as the last time we were there but it really is a weird space to begin with.

The remodel after Buttita's is as good as one can do when turning a lovely restaurant into a sports bar-style restaurant (though why one would want to do that is beyond me).  And that's where the good stuff stops.In short, the service and all things related to it were glacially slow; the food, when it arrived, was mediocre at best -- and missing key elements (one whole order, and other parts).  This restaurant cannot possibly last if they don't figure out how to greet and serve customers, or get the food that was ordered actually to the tables.The full story.Upon arrival, we found a vacant hostess stand, then a long walk down the hall to the dining room along which we saw no one who works there.  Luckily, we ran into friends who assured us that we could seat ourselves.After waiting at our table for some 15 minutes, we used a bit of self-help, and accosted a waitress to ask for some menus.  After another 5-7 minutes another waitress finally showed up with menus and silverware. She did not offer water, or to bring us a drink of any sort - just plopped the menus down and disappeared.Quite some time later, our waitress arrived, apologetically, and took our order.  We ordered an appetizer (cheese fries), and three meals: 1 burger (would have been on wheat bread but despite the menu, they had none), one 1/2 ribeye (which the menu says was supposed to be thick, but which was certainly not), that should have come with some interesting sounding twice baked potato casserole, and one individual pizza.  My daughter ordered a diet, I ordered water, and my husband ordered a beer.The water and diet only took about 7 minutes to arrive.The appetizer might have arrived after another 10, but the food runner carrying the plate of cheese fries tried to deliver them to another table. Having learned he had the wrong table, the lad just took them back to the kitchen.Eventually, the cheese fries arrived.  They weren't as hot as one would like, and for the price, there should have been a LOT more cheese.  The fries were no better than I could make using frozen crinkle fries from the grocery.Within 3 minutes of the appetizer's tardy arrival, some of our food arrived.The burger (but not the beer), and my steak with vegetable, but no potato casserole, and no pizza.The waitress arrived, and asked if everything was there, we told her \"no\", and pointed out that we were missing the beer, the potatoes and the pizza.  Ten minutes later the beer arrived.My husband then went up to the window where the pizza would have been put up for a food runner -- no pizza had been ordered.So. The steak was fatty, but moderately tasty, if only tepid.  The broccoli was cold, the burger was not as good as you can get at, say Hardee's (despite costing twice as much). We never did get the pizza.  Or the potatoes.  I DID offer to come in as a consulting manager to help them teach the staff how to actually wait tables......",

There was no one at the front to tell you to seat yourself or not. We walked in at 7pm and the place was pretty busy. We left at 9pm after finishing our food and paying. It took 2 hours from start to finish just to get a meal. Luckily we weren't in a hurry. The only good points are the building is very nice and there are a lot of TVs. The bad- We requested 3 times to have the TV changed to a game we wanted to watch. 3 different people said OK, and it was never changed. When we were ordering, I asked the waitress if the rib eye sandwich was an actual steak, or shaved. She said she didn't know and instead of asking someone else, she just said she wasn't sure and starred at me. It was very uncomfortable. I was disappointed and got a burger instead. We had a 30 minute lapse where we needed a beer and no one ever came. Finally we went up to the bar and got it ourselves. They never brought out my buddy's salad. The burger was plain and way overcooked. I ordered a side of creole coleslaw which was just normal slaw. My advice- It's the little things they need to get right. Add some seasoning to your burgers and cook them correctly. Put a sign up that says seat yourself. Train waitresses to be professional. Get more staff because an hour and fifteen minute ticket time is just comical. Get more beers on tap, and include a beer menu with the food menu (it takes 30 seconds to drop one in each menu, don't be lazy). Finally, pay attention to details with peoples' food orders. It's bad when every review mentions not getting something they ordered or a mistake in the order.A guy, who I think is the owner, was walking around and asking people if they needed anything, which is good. I'm hoping he reads this and takes note because I'd like to go back due to the atmosphere and location, but I might wait a month or 2 for better service and food.EDIT*** I went back in early February, approximately 2 months after opening and my first experience. The service was A LOT better. I got the Pizza and it was pretty good. The beers kept coming. 4 beers + Pizza was around $22+tip.I can see myself going here again now...",

But, the food is terrible, and unfortunately, I doubt I will ever go back. The staff is friendly, and I really want them to succeed, but I think the writing is already on the wall.  If they don't fix the food, it's going to fail.First off, it is more of a restaurant atmosphere than a \"Saloon\", as suggested by their logo.  I went for lunch, and there was quiet music in the background, and everything was spotless.  Don't expect it to be a raucous bar.  I'm not really sure what it will be like inside on game days.Second, even though the name says \"brew\", this place specializes far more in wine than in beer.  It's not even on the menu!  They had 5-6 domestic beers on tap, but nothing that stands out.Unfortunately, the real killer here is the food and the prices.  The fries are crinkle-cut frozen fries (unacceptable), and it costs $1.75 to add them on to a burger.  A burger without fries shouldn't be more than $5, but it's $7.50 here, and it's not even that large.  The only good thing to say about the burger is that you can customize it more than almost any other place.  They had probably 6 types of cheese, 6 types of rolls, lots of toppings, and sauces.  Unfortunately, the burger itself was terrible (probably frozen meat).A friend got a pizza, and the spices and toppings on the pizza were good.  But, I'm pretty sure the pizza dough was precooked a different day, and then just pulled out of the freezer.  It was tough, and mediocre.I really hope that the owner sees this and fixes the food issues.  If so, I'll be back.  But, as it stands now, this place is doomed to failure.EDIT 3/13/2014:I'm updating the review today, since I went back for dinner.It seems the frozen fries are still there, but the dinner food seems quite good.  I got the thick cut ribeye, rare, and it was genuinely cut thick, priced very well, and extremely tasty.  My fiance ordered one of the overpriced burgers plus fries.  The fries were still not good, but for some reason, she wasn't charged for them. The menu says they cost extra ($1.75, I think), but I'm wondering if they just include them for free now.  If they are included, then the burger is not really overpriced.  The burger was much better this time, and the amount of customization allowed is really fantastic.  The decor is still great, the place is very clean, and we had good service.  Considering all of this, I feel that I should raise my review to at least 3 stars.  I've decided to go to 4, since I feel bad about the earlier negative review.",

After going to Bevier Cafe yesterday with a couple of friends, the good news is that I don't dislike the place.We arrived a few minutes before the cafe closed, and they were out of some of their entrees.  The food we got seemed to have been sitting out for a while, and it wasn't as tasty as I anticipated.  Also, their service seems kind of disorganized--you take a tray, tell the people at the counter what you want, pay for it, go sit down with an empty tray, and then the employees bring you your food.  Couldn't they just hand the food over the counter?  Or just have real servers?  Even with the not-as-good-as-expected food and the confusing service, I like the concept of Bevier Cafe.  I'm happy to support a student/university-run restaurant, and I will eat there again.",

You probably won't love every dish they make, but there's little displays so you have a pretty good idea what you're getting.  The prices have increased a little from what other reviews say, to $5 an entree for lunch and $0.75 for sides.  But I think it is usually worth that.Some things I've had here:Pastrami on marbled rye: was quite tasty.  Maybe not quite as flavorful as the Beef Stand, but cheaper and closer for me.  Fried okra: is the best I've had in town.  Yum.FSHN chips sandwich: I was a little disappointed in this one - there seemed to be less fish than breading.Beer battered cod and chips - was pretty good.Mushroom and turkey panini - also pretty good, and satisfying on a cold  day.Manhattan clam chowder: I liked this a lot, it had a tasty broth and many chunks of fish.  I'll have to try the soups more often.Overall: since there are multiple dishes, it seems like there's usually at least one thing worth trying.  I've never had the salads or desserts, but they look pretty good.  Service has been good every time I went, though obviously this depends a bit on the students working.  I've been pretty happy with the food, I kinda like the cafeteria style set-up, and the price is right.  I'll be coming back here to try out more of the menu.  Great for a day when you forgot your lunch or just need a break and some tasty grub.Since I found it, it has become one of my regular lunch spots.

Today I had indian stew with lentils, veggies (carrot, bell pepper, onion), salmon, and tilapia.. super yum! It came with verrrry tasty fried pitas. love it!They always have lots of options for discriminating palates and take cards!",

I also had the South Western Fiesta Turkey and Corn Salad and the daily special- which was Chicken Gumbo. It all cost about $11 which is more than I was expecting to pay but I was very full. The Salad was great. And I NEVER like salads. I generally go out of my way to pay extra for an alternative but I noticed that the salad today looked pretty good and I was glad I made that choice. It was chock full of fresh vegetables, juicy chicken, and great taste! The salads here are wayy bigger than the entrees. I was not impressed with the Gumbo. I can't put a finger on it but I have to say that the overall flavor was not appealing...",

They also offer portable coffee mugs for $10 with $.50 refills for an eternity after! take that, espresso royale!!  on my graduate student budget, it sure makes me warm and gooey inside to know that i can get real food (and the elixir of life- coffee!) at such an affordable price and in a convenient location.  sure beats my made in 30 seconds pbj for lunch!",

It's a nice cross between a fancy restaurant and a cheap cafeteria.There are always at least a few dishes to pick from, rotating daily.  They also have a house salad and Greek salad every day.  They charge $5 for (practically) every entree, which is sometimes too much, sometimes too little for the dish.  On the other hand, all sides are $0.75, so it all kind of evens out.  They also have rotating desserts, but always have big, soft, fresh cookies.Although going through the line to pay with your tray feels like a cafeteria, the seating is basic, but very nice, wooden, and pretty comfortable.  You sit with a number and relax and wait for your dishes to be brought to you--which usually isn't too long.They do serve breakfast, but I haven't been able to try it yet.  The convenience of being able to check the menu on the website pushes the score to an A+!",

You see, I have a class from 11-12 in Bevier Hall, and the cafe itself is exactly one floor below my classroom.  Did I mention I get out at noon?  When lunch is served?  Yeah, you do the math.It's a damn good thing that B.C. is relatively cheap ($4.50 for a major entree, or sandwich), or I'd be broke and panhandling in front of the place at this rate.  The Food Service students run a fantastic local cafe that helps them get hands on experience and gets me lunch time eatin' on the cheap.  There's always a vegetable side, some mouthwatering dessert, and the space is cheery and pleasant if a bit utilitarian.  Bevier's well worth the visit.  That said, it's basically cafeteria style in that you pick up a tray, select your food options, add on bread, dessert, drinks, etc, then pay for your meal.  They'll give you a number, and a smiling food service student will bring you your food--often eerily promptly.  Now, my only request is that you don't crowd up the place when i come charging in all hungry like.  Cuz that's not cool.But go check out the cafe, with a fantastic array of food orders (and a daily changing menu!), you're bound to be satisfied.",

What makes it so great is you can taste the freshness of each of the ingredients in every dish. Each option is carefully crafted to display the perfect balance or flavors. The menu options do change due to seasonal availability for veggies/fruit which means there is always something new to try! While the prices are a little bit higher than other sit down places, it is definitely worth it.",

Absolutely no seasoning on anything left the entire meal bland and uninteresting.  The exception being two overly sweet sauces that did not really enhance the food and seemed out of place.  Not a salt or pepper shaker in sight, platters put down with no serving utensils and scarce wait staff.  The entire service disrupted concentrating on the speaker.  Several commented they felt hungry afterwards because the food lacked flavor.Also, the drinks menu is too eclectic.  Not everyone is interested in craft beers and the mixed drink options were very limited.",

They have put a great deal of thought into the atmosphere and aesthetic of the restaurant but not enough into what the customer wants to eat.  I have visited three times and each time I go I come away a little more disappointed.  The unique menu loses its appeal when the food is more satisfying to look at on the plate than it is to taste.  The ice cream sandwich dessert was perhaps the toughest dessert I have ever ordered at any restaurant.  Their one vegetarian friendly option was mac and cheese which gets tiresome to vegetarians.  With the volume of alternative diets being practiced, especially in a college town, I assumed a trendy place like this one would cater more to the non-traditional eater.  Their new twists on traditional food abandons the American-fare loving customer, as well as the non-traditionalists.",

A great, locally sourced, and seasonally rotating menu that has quite a bit of variety in terms of flavor as well as price. So if you're a cheapskate always looking to get the most for your money (like me =D) then you won't find Big Grove too bad. If you're also looking to empty your wallet they can accommodate that as well. The interior is hip, but not too hip, and I find the layout of the place pretty comfortable.The service here varies from day to day and depending on when you're dining, although I don't recall ever having a less than decent experience. Service staff is always very attentive and friendly and the food is always prepared well. They also have neat specials from time to time like half off house cocktails on Tuesdays! Overall a great place to go with a group or a date. Especially in the summer months when the patio is open!P.S. One of my favorite places for brunch in the area. If you don't care for the dinner selections you should definitely try the place Sat/Sun morning.",

The restaurant was basically empty, and I asked if we can instead push 2 regular tables in the bar area together so everyone in the party could talk with each other. They seemed annoyed and the manager made a point of saying she would check to make sure our server \"didn't mind.\" Did I mention the restaurant was empty? I would think  they would want customers and make them feel welcome. Afterwards when the bill came we asked why they didn't charge the advertised happy hour prices. The server said that's only if you sit AT the bar. We sat at tables. Wow. Bottom line: This is not a customer-focused place.",

The food is fantastic, and as much as possible locally sourced. I love the Big Grove burger with fried egg on top, as well as the mac and cheese and tater tots appetizer. Because of the local aspect of the ingredients, expect to pay $2-3 more than you would at a local chain, but the improved atmosphere and deliciousness definitely make it worth it!",

The only difference is that Big Grove Tavern is good.I really hate hipsters. Like, some of the stuff that comes out of their mouths actually angers me. So I was not too eager to come to this place thats all \"local, farm to table, blah blah blah.\" Because a lot of times thats a hipster excuse for mediocre tasting food. I dont care if its local or organic or any of that. I just want it to be tasty!! When we walked in I was like... here we go. The OC soundtrack is playing, the menu comes on little clipboards with the farms listed on it, and there is no salt or pepper shakers on any of the tables. It seemed pretentious to me. But for the most part, everything I tried here was tasty.We had the fried cheesy grits, french fries with malt vinegar aioli, and pickled veggies for an appetizer. I didn't try the vegetables because pickled stuff is not for me. The other two passed the test.For dinner, I ordered the macaroni and cheese. In retrospect I wish I would have ordered the vegetarian version because there was so much bacon in this that it actually took away from the goodness of the cheese. But +1 for it being piping hot.The rest of the family had a pork tenderloin, beef short rib, and burger. I tasted the short rib and the burger- the rib was a little salty but still good. The burger was flavorful but for me (and this is just a personal preference) the mixture of meats made it a little too soft.We did have dessert- Gooey butter cake and a chocolate pot-de-creme. The butter cake fell a little short. I was expecting it to be warm and gooey. It was cold, not gooey, but still rich. The pot-de-creme, was... *kisses fingers like an italian chef* Perfectly bittersweet, rich rich rich, and topped with vanilla whipped cream that I could see the little vanilla speckles in. Nom.Our server was really cool and seemed to genuinely enjoy his job. He kept referring to the chef as \"chef,\" like \"chef makes this, and chef did that\" which was kind of irksome, just because its like... you're in Champaign IL, chef. Come back down to earth a little.",

It's a blend of beef, bison & pork, you can add cheese, and it has an aioli on top.  I've tried it bunless, and the meal is equally as satisfying sans bun bc the meat is so juicy and flavorful!Each time you dine in, you get a little tin of complimentary seasoned popcorn of the day.  Nice touch.  Another nice touch is the olive oil drizzle you can request on the vanilla ice cream for dessert!On my latest visit, I wandered in at brunch time and tried the chilaquiles.  Based on my previous dinners here, I had high hopes for the dish, but my heart sank with my first bite, as the pulled chicken was cold.  I was able to find a few pieces that were lukewarm, but that was disappointing.  The two poached eggs were bordering on cold too, so they had obviously been poached earlier.  Atleast the tortilla chips were crunchy...  I also appreciated the fresh cup of decaf brought to me mid-meal, since the kitchen had just brewed a fresh pot.  I would've enjoyed a meal as hot as that coffee!Last notes: I liked the strings of lights hanging from the ceiling, ornaments hanging by the bar, and snowflakes drawn in the window.  Very festive!  Music playing was right up my alley too, so I enjoyed the ambiance.",

I got the burger and it was real good - they forgot to put the egg on it like i ordered but brought me out an egg minutes later.  the drinks were really good too - had a bullet old fahioned.

The welcome snack is a daily-fresh made popcorn with a rotating seasoning.  Ours was crazy good, but we had to ask the server to place the flavor:  cumin & orange zest!  Apparently the chef regularly changes it.The tap and bottle list is craft beer lover's friend. Not trying to outdo a number-of-taps contest, but all the right choices were there. Especially loved the slightly sarcastic \"These Beers?\" bottom of section of the menu for those who want a Bud Light instead.Tater tots are like nothing you've seen: homemade and tasty with an apple sauce. The smoked bacon practically jumped off the deviled eggs.The menu feels relatively small when you're used to the pages and pages on your typical chain.  And I wouldn't mind if they expanded it a bit, but there were so many good looking items, I think it will take several visits without any boredom. That most of the ingredients are locally bought makes it worth it.Service was exactly what you expect from a place like this: a whole step above any chain restaurant. Constant attention, knowledgeable about the food, funny and warm, but never over-intrusive. Perfect!Nice job, Big Grove Tavern.  We'll be back.",

The meat was alright in texture and flavor but was overpowered by the marmalade.Turkey Horseshoe: Turkey sandwich with beer mustard, 3-cheese mornay cheese sauce, and mixed greens. The mix of mustard flavor and turkey was a good mix.Trout hash: Nice clean flavors with a mix of nice vegetable elements such as corn and green onion.Deviled egg: Good texture with nice crispy chip but wasn't a huge fan of the yolk.Spiced nuts: Fresh and tasty, nothing unusual from other good spiced nuts however.Fresh baked soft pretzel: Nice mustard but the pretzel itself was a bit tough.Cornbread: Nice corn flavor and texture, one of the best items of the meal.Overall, a nice choice if you're not visiting Desithl nearby but a little pricey.",

This is the third time I've eaten here, so I feel qualified at this point to pass judgement. My impressions so far:The food is great...although the dinner portions tend to weigh in on the \"smaller\" side.  I had the filet, and what it lacked in size it made up for in taste. It was well cooked and tasted excellent. However, the side that came with it (a mixture of small carrots and potatoes) left something to be desired. This isn't a place you'll go for dinner and take home any leftovers.  The Risotto also tasted great, and while it also wasn't a huge portion, it seemed to be enough to suffice.  The prices were also fairly reasonable for a medium-to-upper scale restaurant, except for the $8 cocktail which seemed on the skimpy side, size-wise.Two other standouts at this place for me are the deviled eggs appetizers ($1 a piece, and delicious!) and the Tavern Burger, which is a mixture of beef, pork, and bison and is the reason I will keep going back.  For my money, it's one of the best burgers in town.",

However, the special pork shank and beans seemed a bit of a miss, and the mac and cheese, although quite tasty, was so large and rich and hot that it was difficult to enjoy-maybe it could be a small appetizer, side?  The chef at Big Grove definitely puts out quality, tasty food that re-imagines the standard Midwestern menu.  I applaud that. However, some of the details were slightly troubling: out of draw item (burger) at 7:00 PM; slight gaffe on menu 'These beers?'; one dish that didn't quite work.3.5",

Deviled egg doggy bag anyone... or just me?I had the turkey sandwich, which had so much flavor for a turkey sandwich!  Loved the bread, the cheese, the spreads.  Also ordered at our table was the Tavern Burger (which looked like a big, juicy meatball) and the chicken sandwich.Their menu looks different now, which means rotating sandwich toppings and mains = never gets boring.  Their salads, bar snacks and starters all look amazing this time around too.I plan to make this a regular lunch spot when I'm in the area.  Maybe dinner too, so I can try one of their fun sounding cocktails!",

The staff was excellent - friendly, helpful with menu selections, and accommodating. The menu itself is charming - and the attention to the farm-to-table detail is commendable. There's seasoned popcorn on the table - a nice touch. I tried the very economical \"If It's From The Vine It's Fine\" daily wine special, which was quite a brilliant surprise for the price. I would recommend this to anyone. The take on a wedge salad - using bibb lettuce - was inspired. I was surprised there was no bread served with the salad. And, while I realize this is the chef's preference, I wanted some to sop up a little of the salad's very tasty creamy herb vinaigrette. And so I asked for some bread. And received some lovely bread to accompany the salad. For a main I ordered the Tavern Burger - a monster of beef, bison & pork, red onion marmalade, cornichon aioli - and served with house-cut fries. The fries were great! A bit less greasy version of those fantastic greasy kind of fries you get from a hot dog stand. Super good. As was the burger - the marmalade - and the cornichon aioli. Everything was perfect except...the bun! - Which was so bland and tough and flavorless, I tossed it to the side and knife and forked the burger.I'm sure, if I brought this detail to the staffs attention, they would have somehow taken care of things - they were nice that way. So I can only fault myself for not making an issue of it then. But man - compared to everything else - that was so great - that bun was a letdown. Regardless, I highly recommend Big Grove Tavern.",

The second time I went I met a friend and we sat at the bar. The bartender was inattentive and did not get me a water when I asked the first time. He kept walking away before I got a chance to finish ordering everything and he didn't smile once. When I finally got my food, my medium burger was almost well done, the lettuce on the burger was so soggy it dripped off my burger, and the fries were so salty that they made my stomach hurt. I couldn't finish my burger or the fries and it was extremely overpriced. I would not recommend this restaurant unless you just go for drinks or the eggplant sandwich. You will pay too much and get less than mediocre, almost inedible food.",

The food overall was bland.  We had the chili which was the best of what we ordered, the corn bread that came with it however, well, anyone could make something better tasting from a box mix.  The portabella mushroom sandwich was okay,  most of the flavor came from the butter, not sure what the cheese really was...., and the sweet potatoe chips again, we're okay.   Then came dessert. I am a sweet tooth fanatic, and I have very rarely not eaten a dessert, especially if it is chocolate based. The chocolate bread pudding looked chocolate, but had no chocolate, no sweetness, literally, no taste to it .  I kid you not. Not sure how that happens, but they seemed to master it here.  I see this place has really good reviews for dinner, so maybe it is just their Sunday brunch, but will probably not attempt to go back given the many other wonderful resturants in the area.",

Not to mention lots of very good beer bars.  This place tries to combine the two with a small but well constructed tap list and a small locally sourced menu.  My parents have been here a few times, and warned me of the downfalls (slow service, running out of menu items).  Well, I always have to check a new place out and see for myself.  After our visit, I had to apologize and thank them for humoring me.Anyway, a large open room with an island bar.  The light fixtures look like Christmas lights bought at Farm & Fleet.  The sticks on the ceiling look like they were bought at Hobby Lobby.We were seated right away, which was a good sign.  Though besides the fancy popcorn we were ignored for a long time.  I hate to be the person to say service was slow, cause it was a busy night.  I can deal with slow, but no acknowledgement what so ever was not good.  Incredibly slow kitchen times as well.We finally put our drink and food orders in at the same time.  We were not sure when we would get another chance.  I liked their beer selection.  8 taps of good micros.  Though they were out of four taps.  Half of their selection was out.  I like it when a place can go through kegs and rotate the selection, though no.  They would rather just not have half the selection.  Out of Great Lakes, out of Founders, out of Dark Horse, out of Victory.  I ended up with a Sculpin, and my Dad a Goose Island 312.  If you are going to have a small selection, you need to keep it stocked.The menu was similarly small, but looked good.  My Dad ended up with the last burger, which is a mix of beef, bison, and pork.  Sounds great.  He has tried to eat here before, twice actually.  Both times out of the burger, so it was good that he finally got to try it.   Again, it is good that they can go through the menu like that.  Though it is tiring when they keep running out.  I had the pork sausage, my Mom Mac & Cheese.  It is a tiny menu for dinner, about 5 main courses.  I love when a place can do that.  Just not enough here to pull that off.  Especially when they run out of stuff. On top of that, not much here was that great.  The burger was decent, Mac & Cheese cold, and the sausage was poorly executed with little flavor.  They shout from every corner that everything is fresh and local.  Fine, but make it good.This is one of my longest reviews, and I guess it is this way because I had very high hopes and little was as expected.  Though I was told before hand that everything was slow, over priced, pretentious, not that good, and often out.  This place just left me wanting so much more.",

                "review": "Two of us randomly decided to try Big Grove Tavern after having some beers at nearby Quality Beer. I was pleasantly surprised how great the whole experience was.On Monday night they had a nice pre fixe menu for $50 with shared appetizer, soup/salad, entree, and shared dessert. Otherwise I could see dinner getting pricey here fast. We started with the Brussels sprouts which were lightly fried and not as oily as most fried sprouts. I could eat these all day.We tried a couple of deviled eggs and they fact that you can order them one apiece for $1 is nice if you just want a taste. Pretty standard, but tasty as most deviled eggs (to me) usually are. The cauliflower soup was nice as well. A bit plainer tasting than butternut squash soup, but I would still order it again with some toasted almonds. The steak entree was cooked perfectly though they never asked how I wanted it cooked. Glad they read my mind and got the medium rare cook correct. Root veggies were good too.I wasn't in love with the rice pudding, though it's not usually my thing. I didn't think it actually had rice in it...Though I don't get to Champaign too often, I would easily recommend it for someone looking for a good farm to table restaurant. Especially Mondays!",

The meat was highly overcooked, tough and chewy despite ordering it medium rare. My friend had a risotto, which just looked like mush on the plate. Both of our food came lukewarm. It was a quite busy night Im guessing, and the food sat out waiting to be taken - but any proper restaurant would manage better.When I went for lunch I had a steak sandwich - again with the toughness of the meat and a slightly stale bread this time, by the time I finished eating my jaw was sore, as if it had done some bench pressing.I'm giving 2 stars because of their poutine available on Friday and Saturday evenings after 9pm. It makes for amazing post-bars food, maybe since you are not really caring about quality as much....",

The flavours to everything from the Appetizers to the Main Courses to the Dessert continue to impress.  I have too many favorites to enumerate, but I'd recommend Big Grove Tavern to anyone who loves food.  All local, always fresh.  The Tuesday fried chicken & waffles are amazing.  I have only tried the brunch once, but it was delicious and my whole family had a great time.  Loved the bloody mary's too.  The staff are incredible, possibly the best in town.  The servers know what they are doing and they do with elan, charm and a ready smile.  And everyone cares so deeply that the guests are having a great time.Lastly, I have been hanging out at Big Grove's beautiful bar (and I have learned that even the bar is \"local\" made by a local artisan) and it is becoming a truly cool after work watering hole.One word of advice, if you are planning on a Friday or Saturday dinner visit, you probably would be wise to make a reservation(which I did from their website via Opentable.com).  Easy to do. Try it.  You'll love it too.",

My friend got the chicken which was also really well put together and tasted great. While we were there, a Spanish mariachi band stopped by and played and that also really added to the fun atmosphere. The place was not overcrowded so it was really enjoyable to sit there for a while.

                "review": "A solid two stars, yes!First of all, I'll say the taste of the food is pretty good.  The quality of the food and drink was above average.  The popcorn presented when we arrived was nicely flavored with spices, but came in a rather small tin.  We began with two cocktails which were delicious, but for the area, were either too small, or overpriced.  Thus began the battle of the perceptions in regards to overpriced versus tiny portions.We did not have appetizers because in my mind, they were a little pricey.  Deviled eggs for $1.00 each?  Ok, I get it, these are local eggs.  But half of an egg with a little mayo and some flavoring mixed into the yolk for $1.00?  Nope, still expensive.  Fries for $4.00?  Nope, not for this guy.  Besides, Illinois isn't know for their potato harvests.  $9.00 for a mixed greens salad?  How about make that salad plural and give us a couple of them for that price?Moving on, I wanted to try the famous \"Tavern Burger.\"  However, at 7:45 p.m., in a restaurant which wasn't packed out, they were out for the evening.  Really?  Hmmm, how strange.  You mean the cheapest choice for dinner, the one item which was mentioned in the newspaper and was considered your house specialty, and, worth mentioning again, your CHEAPEST dinner choice, was out so early?  How very strange...  I guess that meant I would have to choose a more expensive option. (And, incidentally, our server told us you made it fresh every day.  So, why didn't you just whip up a little more of the mix?  Or, does the bison truck come very morning?)We chose the Trout and the Pork Loin.  First, the portion sizes were tiny.  For the price of the trout, we expected at least half of a small trout for $18.00.  What we got was about 1/3 to  1/2 of a side of a small trout.   As for the pork, we received what amounted to about a 3 oz. portion.  Now, I understand it's local.  But, and I'm saying this as a consumer and a cook, pork is not expensive.  There is no grocery store in Champaign where you can go and find any cut of pork out pricing Beef.   And, the accompaniments, the turnips, chicory and cornbread were nice, tasty and well presented, were cool and not substantial.  The pork, for the price, should have been at least twice the size, and even this would have made the price extravagant.We shared a bottle of white wine from the menu, the wine selection being very good by the way, and also had dessert.  I had the Ice Cream Sandwich (which should have been slightly warmed so as to not have been served rock hard), and my guest had the Pot de Crme.  Both were delicious!Overall, I believe our bill totaled more than $140.00.  Can you believe it?  $140.00 for two cocktails, one bottle of white wine which retailed for about $13.00, two main dishes and two desserts.   Fine for Haute Cuisine, not fine for a tavern. We found the service to be just about perfect, as our server was attentive and respectful of both our needs and our privacy.The atmosphere is great in this place.  The food is good, but not great.  With the expanding options in the area, especially the great options across the street, there is little to nothing to draw me back to this establishment.",

                "review": "We went for an early Saturday night dinner, drawn in by new fine dining in the area (which is limited) and the promise of local farm to table style. We are huge fans of many local farm efforts, which can be sampled at the Common Ground Co-op and the Market at the Square on Saturdays at Lincoln Square Mall -- and now, Big Grove Tavern.First, the food, from a foodie perspective: Fresh product, well selected and well cared for. The flavors of the natural food are highlighted. The preparation is often minimally invasive. The technique is classic French. The flavor profile is quiet. My partner and I both wished for something a touch bolder. For example, the deviled eggs, a pre-starter, have yolks mixed with peas. We would suggest adding an acid note, perhaps a pickle. It was nice that they brought out flavored popcorn as a freebie with our drinks -- a feature at BGT. The flavor of the night was white truffle oil -- and you could taste the oil. That was a real win.For starters, my partner had the chili and cornbread, and I had the chicken liver pate with pickled onions and stewed rhubarb. I think mine was better -- really delicious, with rich, deeply flavorful pate contrasted against the rhubarb, which gave the bite the sweet and sour it needed to cut through. The farmstyle, whole grain bread had a wonderful crunch. The cornbread was a bit too refined -- it needed  more crust and less cake, more corn flavor and less cafe baked-good sweetness. The chili was savory, but mild--no real taste of chilis.The entree and dessert courses were both very good, especially dessert. My partner had the short ribs, which were beautifully medium rare -- not a hint over or under. I had the roast chicken with dumplings, which was amazingly good. Crisp skin, moist and flavorful meat, with a delicious herb broth under. Three dumplings that tasted like a delicate stuffing and had a satisfying bite. Slices of asparagus that also had a nice bite and a lovely green flavor still -- not at all cooked out. The portions seemed just right -- not too much and not too little.For dessert, my partner had the rhubarb crisp and i had the chocolate pot de creme. Both were really superb: refined, flavorful, rich, balanced. Nothing fussy -- just satisfaction in every bite, with very good coffee on the side (they use a medium blend from the Columbia Street Roastery -- a fine choice).The food is not bold. Or experimental. Or imaginative. But it is good, very good -- much better, I thought, in terms of technique than Carmon's Bistro.It's clear from the limited but well selected menu that the chef behind it is attempting to appeal to middlebrow Midwestern tastes, but doing it in such a quality way that I found it kind rather than condescending. People who don't necessarily like a chi-chi dining experience will enjoy the food, and those who do like fine dining will think it is predictable in its selections but well done nonetheless.Second, the decor and atmosphere: I generally like the blend of industrial and contemporary tavern that the interior designer seems to have been going for, although the dark colors dominate a little too much, despite the effort to add bits of fun in the lighting options. BGT has a chic, young vibe -- somewhere between casual and serious. Dark gray walls with a black drop tile ceiling, black wire-cage pendant lamps with industrial bulbs of different shapes (reminds me of the recent Restoration Hardware line), bleached branch chandeliers over the bar area, outdoor party-lights with clear exposed globe bulbs interlaced with raw blond planks (one off note: the planks have lumber-yard stamps, which may be a bit too low-end for what they were going for),  fairly inexpensive light-wood grain tables and nicely selected dark chairs--if a bit flimsy--and booth upholstery. I hope that over time BGT will invest in some better art pieces, and ones that bring more interest and warmth to the interior. There's seating outside too, if you're a smoker or don't mind getting it second hand.Third, cost: Yes, yes, it's on the expensive side. BGT is fine dining, not family dining. I won't be eating here every night either. Of course, any diner can make the meal more affordable by just sticking with an entree, rather than getting the whole shebang -- I'd guess for dinner that this would run you $20-25 tops. But if you have a deeper pocket that night, the whole shebang here could run you $100 with tip for two -- and you still won't feel cheated. The value is here, given the quality of experience.Fourth, service: BGT has a young, eager service staff. They took good care of us, and every other table I could see. From beginning to end, we enjoyed our time here.",

I went in January with a group of friends for my birthday and I can't say I remember exactly what I got but it was very good.Went here more recently while my boyfriends parents were in town(and I was meeting them for the first time, yikes!) so a good meal was a must. We went on a Monday and did the date night menu which I have enjoyed before. My boyfriend got the grits with pickled vegetables and said they were amazing. I got the pate and I could have eaten that everyday and not gotten sick of it, so good. I got the risotto and he got the filet, both equally tasty. His parents said their meals were great too. There was also a nice beer selection to choose from. The only problem I've ever had there was one of their mixed drinks tasted very funny to me. Overall, the food outweighs that though.",

I came in with a group of friends for lunch one day, and while the service was nice, the environment fine, the food was just completely underwhelming.I ordered the burger for lunch, with a side salad.  The burger was incredibly difficult to eat, and not due to excessive size, or the usual suspects.  I added an egg for 1.50, which turned out to be a mistake.  Although the flavors were OK, the bun just wasn't able to hand and got soggy, the burger decomposing as I ate it.  The proportions were off, and the lack of spectacular taste just made the meal messy with no upside.  The lettuce was completely wilted under the burger and the onions were entirely too sweet.Similarly, the salad was unfortunate.  Too much dressing and an overly generous hand of salt and citrus made the salad too salty and sour.For the entire meal, I paid $17 including tax and tip, which is OK for a downtown area.  However, I'd suggest that you check one of the other places around if you're looking for a solid burger.",

Unfortunately, I went there for lunch and had the chicken salad sandwich. I wish I had read the other reviews about it before I ordered.  The chicken salad was absolutely flavorless, and there wasn't much of it. The bread was dry and tasteless. Moreover, the dish cost $9.00.  I hope the owners are reading these reviews, because the chicken salad sandwich is consistently getting bad reviews, and needs to be revamped or taken off the menu altogether.",

It was two fried tortillas with black beans, rice, and salsa verde. It was topped with 2 fried eggs. Big Grove Tavern is not a place where you go just to \"have lunch\".

I love that scene so I was excited to try Big Grove Tavern for a nice dinner. I love that we could get a reservation at 8 p.m. and the service was wonderful. The menu looked very unique, flavorful and fun. However, none of the dishes blew me or my friends away. Everything was good and I appreciate how fresh the food was, but it all needed a little something more. The deviled eggs were awesome and so fun to order one at a time. Our wine was delicious and I appreciated their drink menu. The ambiance was cool as well. If I lived in Champaign I would go back, I just have a feeling that their meals are hit or miss.",

The restaurant was by no means packed, but it took an hour to get our food, and we were offered no refills on water.  When we asked the bartender questions about the menu, he responded with an indifferent \"I don't usually work brunch\"...alrighty.  The food was delicious, but bordered on cold by the time it arrived. Bartender seemed to be tinkering around with menial tasks to avoid contact with customers.  After asking for the bill and producing a card, he walked away, forcing us to leave cash in order to get to the game.  It's gameday in Champaign, and we were decked out in Illini apparel...generally, servers know there's a game and will do their best to get you going.  I think in the future we will stick with Destihl, where service is always top-notch.",

We started with the tater tots and deviled eggs for appetizers. I loved the tater tots. They're not your typical frozen tots. They had some kind of apple puree sauce on the plate. Initially, I was skeptical, potato and apple together? It was delicious though. Holy cow. I really enjoyed that. I wish more than 4 came in an order though. The deviled eggs were nice, also. I really got a lot of the sweet pea flavor. It sounds odd but it was great and added a freshness to the egg. For dinner, several of us got the burger. Ohhhh my gosh. It was great. Cooked to the perfect temperature. It was a combo of bison, pork, and beef. The red onion marmalade on top was awesome. It added a sweetness and a lot of great flavor. A couple other people had the fried egg on top and they enjoyed it. The bun wasn't store bought and tasted homemade, very similar to what my husband bakes. It was nice to have a bun that doesn't disintegrate. The hand cut fries that came with the burger were the best fries I have had in years. Another friend INHALED the white fish. I didn't taste it but he said it was great. Someone else got the pork belly and kohlrabi gratin. She said it was great and was really happy with her choice. I wish I hadn't been at the opposite end of the table so I could have stolen a bite. It looked good. For a cocktail I had the Tavern Infusion. It was great and refreshing. There was a good selection of beer and wine, too. I stuck with one cocktail and water though. It was a nice touch when the owner came around to the tables and said hi and checked on us and other tables. She seemed really nice. Everyone at our table enjoyed the meal. We will definitely be back again, hopefully sooner than later.",

Like others before me have said, I definitely appreciate their fresh, simple approach that values quality ingredients and careful preparation.Several things hold me back from a full-throated endorsement, however.  First, the prices are steep.  The one reasonably priced entree item- the burger- frequently runs out.  I'm not sure if I just hit this place at the wrong time over and over, but I've only ordered it successfully once.  They know the demand is there, so why not have more? I understand that they don't want to freeze it, or whatever, but I've hit that place at 7 o'clock, and they're out of hamburgers.  It becomes apparent pretty quickly why there's no rush to increase their supply- because every other entree costs 5 dollars more. Secondly, the other (non-burger) entrees are small.  I rarely finish my plate at ANY restaurant, but here, it's no contest; I finish it all.  Last time, I ordered the mushroom risotto.  It was AMAZING.  I loved it!  But the size of it seemed like little more than a side dish.  My S.O. and I looked at each other at the end of the meal with our empty plates between us and I could tell we were thinking the same thing - I'm still so hungry!  Afterwards, we ended up going to Merry-Ann's around the corner for chili cheese fries (our adventure at that establishment is detailed in another review).Finally, service is hit or miss.  Last time, my S.O. ordered the special.  The server said that she wasn't sure they still had the special, so he went ahead and ordered a back-up entree in case (this was his idea, not hers).  She never came back to tell us what result.  The runner came out with our food, and of course, it was not the special, but the backup.  She was busy, but it would have been nice if she had just swung by and told us that they were indeed out of the special.  I think she might have been new, because her server-patter was also wanting. (She really didn't know what to say to us when she first approached the table.)  She also forgot my Patio Pounder (a great cocktail, BTW) until I reminded her, and I only got it once I was almost done with my entree.  I had water, so it was no big deal, but the overall experience (coupled with the bill at the end) quashed the overall good vibe of the place.Before I move, I do think I will go back and give it another shot.  Their date night menu looks like a good deal, and I'm really rooting for this place to be all it can be.",

I would have given this place 4 stars if not for the service, which has been some of the worst I have received in Champaign-Urbana.  More on this shortly.I love select dishes on the menu, but I feel like you have to know what to order.  The burgers are INCREDIBLE.  I never want to eat another burger that is not a mix of beef, bison, and pork.  Awesome.  And the fries with it are great!As much as I enjoy the burgers, there are times that you want some variety.  I know that it is trendy to include deviled eggs on a menu, but this are nothing special.  However, I feel like the pretzel makes up for this.  The pretzel is great and if you like your mustard with a HEAVY amount of spicy horseradish, this is for you!  I also really enjoyed the pork belly, but wish it was larger than just a starter.All of that being said, all of my recent experiences there have been a service disaster!  We have enjoyed going for the Friday outdoor concert series because we can sit outside and enjoy dinner, a beer, and the music.  In fact, until the service problems began we would go every week religiously.  Earlier in the summer the service was not a problem.  However, the past several times we have gone, we have literally had to BEG to be waited upon.  Each of these times, we have arrived, been seated, and then waited for 20-30 minutes before any server came to our table to even take a drink order.  We have had to ask the hostess or manager, some times several times in the same meal, to have one of the wait staff come to our table just to take an order.  The last straw was when the same friend was there for TWO DIFFERENT MEALS IN A ROW (seated at an entirely different table) and she too was talking with the management to try and get someone to take our order.The paranoid person in me worries that this lack of service is because we came with a small child.  Our child is quite well-behaved in a restaurant, but we try to be courteous and go for very early dinners when we know she will not be a problem.  We always try to order the full meal (drinks, dinner, dessert) up front and ask that the bill be given to us when the drinks arrive so we can make a quick get-away if necessary.  My point is that this is the one time that we actually get to go out and enjoy an adult meal and activity and I don't want it regularly spoiled by bad (or nonexistent) service, regardless of whether or not it is because I have a child with me.  I have wasted this time for several weeks in a row at Big Grove and don't plan on doing so again for a long time.  There are plenty of other options in the area.",

But before I get to the meat of my review, no pun intended, let me say that Big Grove Tavern is exactly what this town needed. When Jim Gould's closed I was sad to see it go but what has come in it's place is something really fantastic. From the food to the interior to the crowd, the energy Big Grove gives off is infectious and demonstrates that the confluence of intellect and small-town charm in Champaign can really lead to something amazing.Now on to the food:Popcorn: Come for free as a starter. While I was hoping for bread, I was even happier with this. The popcorn really whets your appetite without being too filling. I hear the flavor changes; it was definitely some kind of lime (think the hint of lime you find certain Mexican foods) flavor when I was there.Tavern Burger: There are so many things I can say about the Tavern Burger. First and most simply, it's delicious. The blend of bison was for me, the most prominent of the three meats that make up the burger but overall I found it to be rich, meaty and just the right amount of gamey given the bison. The onion marmalade, and petite crusty bun complimented the burger without overpowering the taste of the meat. I opted to add the fried egg which led to messy experience given the soft yolk, but a certainly more delicious one. At this point, if I did this right, you are so convinced about the deliciousness of the burger you won't even care to hear about the fries. But hey, if you're still interested: they're completely well-executed- crisp yet still potatoey. Now... onto my other comment on the Tavern Burger. There was some review on here about how the burger is in limited quantities. That's how you know it's fresh and locally sourced! If I wanted something from a freezer I'd head down by the mall and swallow some hormone-laced, bacon-cheese-blue cheese-fried onion-black forest-ham-ranch dressing-heart attack in a bun. If you want a burger that satisfies your burger craving while still being an appreciable entree and cut of meat, come enjoy the Tavern Burger. And if you've missed it, just come back and try again! And frankly, at 12 bucks, it's not that bad. The downtown Champaign restaurant scene generally errs on the more expensive side. Given what Jim Gould's prices used to be like, Big Grove is far more reasonable price-wise in comparison. In sum, ignore the hate, embrace the love, Big Grove will have you leaving full, happy and pleasantly surprised by what Champaign has to offer food-wise.",

                "review": "I was glad to see something young and fresh in place of Jim Gould. Gould was boring and dated, but the only option we had in the C-U if you wanted to go to a \"nice\" restaurant. Big Grove Tavern has a casual updated atmosphere with an original concept for the C-U (farm to table). We wanted to go to Destihl (right across from Big Grove) yesterday for lunch,  but there was a wait and we couldn't wait. We finally had a chance to try Big Grove. There was no wait, and we were seated right away. We were with our 2.5 year old, and  we have never gone to a kid restaurant. Our daughter is used to dining in grown up restaurants with grown ups, but even the most patient of young foodies could use a quiet distraction while they wait.  Destihl is not a kids' restaurant, but they have a variety of foods to choose from on the kids' menu and they give the kids crayons to color on the kids' menu. Smart and simple concept that works well. The server at Big Grove said they do not have a kids' menu, but they have \"kid friendly\" options. All they had was grilled cheese and sweet potato fries. I asked if we could just get regular potato fries and the server said \"yes\" so that is what my daughter got. I never understood the whole trend of replacing delicious french fries with sweet potato fries--they don't taste better nor are they \"healthier\" or much lower in calories. If you are going to eat fries make them from potatoes not sweet potatoes. I wanted to order a burger, but all their burger options are a blend of beef, bison and pork and I don't want to eat bison so I ordered the Black Bean Burger.  My husband ordered \"The Baltimore\"which is basically a BLT with avocados. My daughter's fries had more salt than there is in salt. Maybe it was just that day, but someone went really heavy handed with the salt. My Black Bean Burger was really good. It's not what I wanted to eat, but if you are vegetarian (I have been on and off for years) this was delicious. My husband's order was okay. It's a BLT with avocado. Why take a classic and add something that adds nothing? The server was great--very nice person and efficient. The design and layout of the restaurant is great. Casual and open. Trying to be a gastropub, but misses the mark with the menu. It's still a big step up for the C-U in terms of dining options. I liked this place. I like the concept, the layout, the service, but the menu is not for me. The food is not bad, but not great. Too many options like a classic burger or BLT are turned into things that are trying too hard to be \"cheffie\", but miss the mark. I just wish they didn't try to reinvent the wheel on these American food classics. If they're going to reinvent the classics they better make them better than the original. I would have liked to see a few classics taken up a notch with a gourmet twist or just a few classics done really well. Overall Big Grove is worth a try, but I wouldn't highly recommend it or anything because the food options are limited and the food tastes okay. Not great, just okay.",

                "review": "Went for lunch last week...maybe the chef has changed since the soft opening as I found nothing overwhelming about the menu and would agree with one reviewer who described it as expensive and limited. I ordered a chicken salad sandwich and it was described as coming with mixed greens since I'd rather have that than sweet potato chips and there was no salad when I got my sandwich. When I asked the waitress she said my salad was on my sandwich...which did have a piece of lettuce on the bottom. Besides that my sandwich was very dry and tasteless. My lunch mate wanted a cup of chili and was told emphatically they only had bowls but when it arrived it was the smallest cup of chili I have seen and for 7$?  The cornbread was bigger than the cupAnother person in the party had the burger.  The 12$ burger. When it arrived it looked like a slider.  I do think he said it was good, but there are far better burger for a better price than 12$.Our bill for lunch for 4 was 70$. Way too expensive for lunch. Even a NYC lunch but the food was not worth it at all.  On the way out a couple diners seated next to us said they couldn't wait to get on their Facebook accounts to let people know how bad this place is. And we agree. I give this place 6 months. Save your money and go to destihl or any other burger joint for better food",

I was wrong...I was down in the U of I area during homecoming and made a reservation just in case it was packed for an early dinner. When we arrived, the place was empty. We were taken to our table and given this small one page menu. I thought it was the drink menu, but no, it was the dinner menu. A bit suprised, I asked my father if he would rather go to DESTIL across the street, but he wanted to try this new local joint. We decided that I was going to get the \"famous\" burger and my dad was going to get the Mac and Cheese. Our server came over and my dad started by ordering the Mac and Cheese, but he asked if he could get it without the onions (shallots and leeks). He was told NO because they already have it premixed. Premixed? She assured him that there was not alot of onions so we continued. For $12 on the burger and $14 for the Mac and Cheese, we were expecting something spectacular. My burger came out. It was a mix of bison, beef, and pork. I was expecting something very flavorful. It was bland as could be. Also, it was about 1/8 of a pound. One of the smallest burgers I have ever eaten. The fries that came with this was good, but the dish was not worth it. My dad's Mac and Cheese came out in a small bowl and half of it was made up of shallots and leeks. I tasted it and thought that it was good, but he HATED it. We had the manager called over and he took it away and took it off of the bill without us asking. He asked if we wanted something else, but my dad complained that the menu was too small for him to go with anything else. Instead of apologizing, the manager told him \"well its all local\" and he walked away. Our server was nice, but I could overhear the hostess and the manager talking about future reservations for the night with an attitude and snarky responses to each other. People can hear you folks!  It was as if they were doing us a favor by being open. In short, skip this place and go to other places within a block of this place. They know how to treat their customers and not to overcharge. I would suggest Guido's!",

Everything blended together perfectly... A medley of flavor so irresistible it has me drooling and wishing I could come back for more. You can trust me on this. I like food. A lot. But this burger changed my life. Buy the Tavern Burger. You won't regret it. One thing I would say: their definition of how well the meat is done is different than most, it is much less cooked than what a usual burger would be. Probably rule of thumb would be to order up from what you usually get if you don't like or are picky about how pink your meat is. i.e. If you're like me and like your burger \"medium rare\" order \"medium\" if you really don't like your meat any more pink than what you are used to. I would highly recommend this restaurant to all people looking for an exceptional and creative meal.",

His salad was yummy. My soup was ok but the salmon made up for it. My son had the pork shoulder very tender and flavorful. Even their ginger ale had a different and unique taste. My daughter had the tavern burger -mmmm she loved it! We all enjoyed the chili fries. The dessert was an apple crisp. I enjoyed it but was pretty sure I ordered a different dessert because no one in my family likes apples. However, since everyone was pretty full we opted for keeping the erroneous yet delicious sweet. I cannot emphasize enough they have amazing customer service!",

Excellent turkey sandwich, though the sourdough is a bit airy for my tastes.  A traditional sourdough needs some ... sourness and doughiness - this really does taste like airy French or Italian bread. The saged popcorn is a nice touch, but I have been here about seven times, and it is always saged popcorn, and the server consistently says \"Our popcorn -today- is fried sage\". ... which to me implies that this will change once in a while.  In my experience, it does not. Finally, and this has been said *dozens* of times here.  The prices are completely out of line with Champaign.  I can get locally sourced ingredients to create a Turkey sandwich and mixed green salad at the local grocery, and a 10oz bottle of the same beer.  Grand total will be well under $20 with a full six pack and ingredients to spare. My damage for lunch?  $23 after a modest tip.  The following day I had a (good) soup of Yellow Beet root and mixed green salad.  To be clear, we are talking about a CUP of soup and a small plate of salad, for $18. Completely out of touch with the local area and absolutely haranguing customers on the guise of farm-to-table.  Want to like it based on the food, can't stand to be here based on the price.

I had pork belly as an appetizer (amazing) with a Dogfish Head 90 minute to chase it down (the beer selection is pretty great). For dinner, I had a perfectly cooked steak (don't remember the cut), served alongside gnocchi. Everything I ate was relatively simple, but they executed perfectly on the local, farm to table ingredients (they're proud of that here). Service was fantastic.The second time I went, in July 2014, the food was very disappointing. The steak was solid again, but it was served alongside one of the most bitter, poorly cooked broccolini I've ever had the displeasure of tasting. The pork tendorloin was chewy, definitely do not recommend. And this time, the pork belly appetizer was served differently, as a salad. I think it's pretty difficult to screw up pork belly, but they managed to do so. It tasted as if it were cooked a day ago, and it was difficult to find much pork belly beneath the greens. Service was tremendous on both occasions. Our water and popcorn (the popcorn is great) were refilled consistently, and the waiter seemed to take pride in the food.",

The restaurant is very inviting and rather large. I love the clean feeling and the hardwood floors. We were seated in the front of the restaurant right near windows for people watching, loved that. There are these cute containers of popcorn on the table. The popcorn is salty, but sweet, nice touch! I checked in on foursquare and got a free deviled egg! The deviled egg was very tasty and different than anything I've ever had.. The egg with the combination of cabbage was tasty! The beer menu was pretty big, which we liked. Unfortunately, we were told right away that they were out of the bison burger, which is one of the reasons we chose this place, so that was very disapointing. I ordered the Mac and Cheese and hubby ordered the steak that came with potatoes and veggies, well done. We had a couple rounds of drinks and our food came. My mac and cheese was good, but a bit dry because of the amount of bread crumbs. I feel like the bread crumbs needed to have more butter or moisture. The cheeses and bacon made this macaroni and cheese pretty good. It isn't something I'd order again for $14, but I liked it. My husbands steak, seemed awfully small for a $20 meal. Probably about 4 oz of meat. Plus, it was cooked more medium than medium well. The sides on the plate were pretty good. Overall, the place was nice, but a bit overpriced for the portions.",

During graduation weekend I attempted to make reservations for 10 (I know...bad idea!) and was told that they were only taking reservations for 8, which I understood, but the hostess proceeded to tell me that if more than 8 showed up she would be obliged to charge my credit card. I didn't argue over the 8 person rule, so why would that be her response?! On a separate occasion I've had my reservation lost which led to a 30 minute wait.  The food: the deviled eggs are always a delight and the drinks are above average. I find the entrees to be a hit or miss as they can sometimes be too salty but the burger is always a solid bet.",

The staff were quite friendly and efficient, and the food was very good. Probably the highlight of the meal was the popcorn instead of bread or rolls; the night we went it was flavored with roasted fennel seed and lemon zest. I usually don't like the taste of anise, but this was really good, and we got free refills without asking.We ordered a vegetarian ragout (creamy with a hint of spiciness), the burger (it's big burger a unique taste from the mix of beef, pork, and bison), the pork shoulder (cooked perfectly), and the pork sausage (after the waitress checked on us, we discovered the root vegetables weren't cooked well enough; the dinner is on a low-carb diet and wasn't going to eat them anyway, but the waitress was very receptive when we mentioned it later). Also two beers--I can't remember which. We didn't have room for dessert, but if it's still on the menu, I want to try the spiced pumpkin bread pudding. Hello? Heaven is calling...Pros: good, local food; great staff; reasonable prices at the \"expensive for a college student\" level (c. $15 per entree)Cons: dim lighting + aging eyes + small print on the drink menu = squintingnoise level --All too often it seems that chic decor and sound-proofing are non-intersecting circles of restaurant interior design.

Potatoes were surprisingly tasty, and the eggs were eggs.

The Seared Pork Belly was totally decadent- buttery, full of umami flavor and perfectly crisp on the outside. Mom got the Faroe Islands Salmon, which was excellently cooked, though the lentils were a touch under-salted. We shared the Apple and Pear Crisp for dessert, which was delicious as well, but my entree really won the night.I ordered the Roasted Mushroom and Poached Farm Egg. I'd originally planned on the Mac n Cheese, but our waitress persuaded me to give the egg dish a shot, and I am so incredibly happy I did. The egg was poached impeccably, and when the yolk broke over those grits, I nearly wept. Everything about it, from concept to execution, was excellent. The grits were rich and creamy, the mushrooms were delightfully earthy and tender, and whatever they did to that sauce was magical. I honestly feel a little depressed that I'll never get to eat it again.

First off, I love farm-to-table restaurants and Big Grove Tavern does a really great job of utilizing local and regional farms. One of my favorite parts of the restaurant is a large map displayed on their wall that pinpoints where each of their ingredients comes from - how awesome is that! When it comes to the restaurant's atmosphere, it's trendy mix of both contemporary and rustic chic. The ceilings are lit with old-fashioned string lights and vintage lightbulbs, and hanging above the bar are driftwood chandeliers. After flipping through the clipboard dinner menu, I decided on the free-range roasted chicken with herb dumplings, green beans, shiitake mushrooms, and fingerling potatoes. The portion size is good, but the flavor was not anything spectacular. The chicken was juicy, but the rest of the dish was undercooked - especially the green beans and fingerling potatoes. All in all, this average tasting dinner dish was not worth $19. For dessert I decided on the girl scout thin mint brownie sundae, complete with mint ice-cream, brownies, chocolate ganache, and sprinkled with peppermint candy (I mean come on, who doesn't love thin mints?) It may have been served in a glass goblet, but unfortunately my expectations of this dessert were much too high. The brownie and ice-cream were good, but the whole dish was overloaded with crushed peppermint candy - it ruined the flavor of the rest of the dessert! I would not recommend wasting $7 on this glorified sundae. Next time I'm in Champaign, I'll be trying out another restaurant in hopes of getting my money's worth.",

I still don't get why kids hate these things so much???Then since I ate vegetables to start like a good kid (I know, yes they were fried, but come on, let me have my cake and it too, okay?), I thought that granted me the ability to get their mac and cheese in a little oven baked dish packed with tons of cheese, bacon, leeks, fried shallots, and then as it should be, topped with crumbled bread crumbs! Mmmmmm that mac and cheese was exactly how I like my mac and cheese! Hot, creamy, cheesy, goodness. Done and done.

Since that initial visit, I have now tried their chicken and dumplings and the skirt steak. The chicken was lovely, moist and well seasoned, the dumplings, however, were a bit of a downer--they were SALTY, small, and sparse, nothing exciting. I might try the dish again, but will have to ask them to be mindful of their salt. The skirt steak was cooked as requested (medium) and was surprisingly tender. I think that they change the accompanying veggies seasonally, but it's always served with a chimichurri (sauce). Given that chimi is one of my favorite sauces, I'll admit that I was skeptical of trying it in Champaign, and was pleasantly surprised--the downfall, they serve it as decorative dots on the plate, rather than a sauce for the meat so there's hardly any of it to enjoy! As you can see, my review of the food has much improved since my first post. I still think that it is overpriced for the portions and location (come on it's Champaign!). My last waitress was pretty good--so service also seems to have improved (or I might've just been lucky).",

After being seated the waitress came within 5 minutes and took our drinks.. 2 lemonades and a Moscow Mule..lemonades came quickly..20+ minutes for the Mule. 20+ minutes later our order was taken...over 40 minutes later we received our food. I was accompanied by my son and 3 year old granddaughter celebrating her birthday.  Items ordered were the flank steak, mac and cheese and kids menu (only 2 items to choose from) chicken tenders.  The food was good but not great. We also ordered ice cream for my granddaughter's birthday and a sweet potato cake that was dry and had a weird after taste.  Our bill came to $80 FRICKN dollars!!! Way way over priced!! This reminds me of Jim Goulds that went out of business for this reason!!I agree with previous reviews that they are trying too much to be different and have Chicago or New York prices. In conclusion, we were there for over 90 minutes (with a 3 year old), food was good but not great and extremely over priced..will not return as there are many better options in Champaign-Urbana.",

Coffee flavored popcorn at starter at every table is a nice bonus.  Make a reservation to get priority outdoor seating.",

First off, our server, Carolyn provided great service, regularly checking in  with us to see if we needed anything else (service is a little like the Three Bears' beds, too much, too little, or just right and Carolyn provided the right amount) and provided well-articulated descriptions of the menu items. Although the portion sizes seemed a bit off (the carb to main item ratio seemed a bit off for both my friend and my dishes) the food was flavorful and the desserts (vanilla ice cream and the olive oil cake) were delicious and worth sticking around for. We opted to eat out on the patio and so, the combination of good food, old friends, great weather and awesome service made for a great lunch break.",

For drinks, my S.O. had two 20 oz. Schlafly Klsch and I tried the Cherry Wheat.  The draft of Schafly was the way to go.  Along came two delightful, Deviled Eggs.  It was superb when paired with the pickled pepper relish.  I almost went with the Seared Walleye, but decided to indulge on a burger with my bf instead.  I've never had a combination of beef, bison, and pork.  Both were cooked to a perfect medium.  However, he ordered his with the additions Amish white cheddar and a fried egg, with the marmalade and aioli on the side.  I ordered mine with everything and a fried egg.  The red onion marmalade was amazing!  I was eating my fries with the bf's side portion.  Next time, I'm asking for extra!  It was so messy, but well worth the lean-in at the bar.  I almost forgot!  The seasoned fries were crispy and well-portioned.",

It was served half-cold and dry-ish like someone just heated by a frozen pack without caring to garnish it with even the slightest bit of flavor or hardwork. The fingerling potato salad came with a honey mustard dressing, which is okay. But who in the world would pair already bitter rhubarb with a mustard sauce to create one of the most horrible tastes one can experience. The chef at big grove, of course. This was a waste of time and money and I'm never going here again.",

Alas, it is not to be.In spite of many available tables, we were seated in a dark and cavernous (all in black) alcove.  Although elsewhere it was the bright light of day, we were barely able to make out the menu in the darkness.  We ordered wine by the glass to start; they waved the bottle over the glass and delivered a very small quantity for a full price pour.  Actually, I like the option of small-glass, but only if they offer the option of paying accordingly...I've had larger pours at free wine tastings around town.  Illinois is beer country, and as they are going local perhaps we would have been better to order a local brew.We waited a long time for our food, allowing our meager splash of wine to warm in the glass so as to save the few swallows to have with our meal.  At long last when it arrived, the spouse's was pleasant enough but mine was not at all as described.  I had ordered the chicken salad on wheat bread with greens; one of the few sandwiches that did not say it was served with chips. All flavors were erased by a thick layer of Dijon mustard and it was served on very dried out toast with chips on the side.  The \"greens\" were a piece of lettuce inserted between the mass of mustard and the dried out bread.  The person at the next table ordered the same dish and had the same impression, asking the waitress where the greens were and commenting on the dried out toast. It was supposed to have tarragon and other interesting ingredients, but every flavor was eclipsed by the strong Dijon mustard.Don't know if it was the worst lunch I had since moving here last summer, but it was clearly the most expensive bad lunch I have had, approaching $50 for two sandwiches--one nearly inedible--and a smidgeon of wine. This was very expensive for mixed quality, not a good value.Pluses: I like that they are trying to source from local farms, although I missed having a fish or seafood option on the menu.  The staff was very friendly. Minuses: Expensive, very small portions, descriptions on menu not accurate, food quality uneven, some bad seating locations.  I gave it two stars for the effort to source locally and the friendliness of the staff.  I a willing to give them a try again in a couple of months to see if they iron out the kinks, but only if I am feeling extravagant.",

                "review": "I was so shocked to read on their website that the chef was from SF? Walking in, it's a cute spot! Nice decor and somewhat okay service - nothing that would stand out. But what runs a restaurant is the food, and we gave it plenty of tries.In January we were in for a date night on the weekend and we told they had oysters! Oh how we miss them. The server seemed pretty confused on how they came, what they were and what sauce came with it, so we went ahead and gave it shot. How can you mess up an oyster, right? Well, good god this was so disgusting! The oysters were on ice, but filled to the brim with this gross creamy orange liquid that was tepid and just...GROSS! It totally covered the whole flavor of the oyster and was absolutely a disgrace to the beauty that's an oyster. So tepid sauce and somewhat cold oyster - feels like a temperature danger zone to me. So again, I'm thinking, the chef is from SF and she does that to an oyster?! Yikes. We then decided to not order dinner because of those oysters (and didn't want to seem like cheapskates) and got the chocolate budino. That dessert is supposed to be pudding-like, but was SO hard and impossible to put a spoon, knife and fork in. So we sat and waited for it to get a little softer, but it was more like a little jar of chocolate that was melted and then refrigerated back into a chocolate bar. That was in no way rich and creamy and custard-like. I would call it \"Chocolate Brick In A Cute Mason Jar\".Came back again and had Sunday brunch as there are limited options in Champaign-Urbana. I ordered the chicken hash and my partner got the huevos rancheros...I think. My chicken hash was full of those bits of chewy cartilage-like chicken that you would, ya know, throw away! Not one piece was edible chicken. I felt absolutely jipped and told the server who didn't seem to care or knew what to do? And the scone we got was just a rock hard lump of dough over baked. I mean you could use that thing as a weapon, lol. So depressing for such a beautiful restaurant and concept. :-/As some have said in their reviews, too: the food is nothing extraordinary. Honestly, for each of our experiences it was pretty gross and I couldn't tell if we came in on off times or what, but not impressed at all. Yuck.",

I looked at both menus, and frankly, because big grove was second, I stayed there. I opted to sit outside, in the sun. It was not bad at all.Onto the  experience... first of all, my waitress was great and very attentive. Each table gets a little bowl of popcorn to start, which is cool. Anyways, their menu is locally sourced, and quite small. They have a few appetizers, and I indulged in two of them. I had a deviled egg (dollar per), and I also ordered the pickled vegetables (radish, onion, fennel, and carrot). The deviled egg came with a rye crisp and sauteed red onions. It was okay, and I'm glad I only ordered one. On the other hand, the pickled vegetables were fantastic! A little pricey at 3 dollars, but definitely the highlight of my meal.For my main course, I ordered the pork, bison, and beef burger. I had the aioli and red onion marmelade on the side. I like my burgers medium. I also ordered mine on whole grain bread instead of the standard bun.The burger was average. It was not cooked medium well, and there was some yellow sauce (not the aioli, but possibly a mustard) that ended up on my burger, even though I asked for my burger plain. My mixed greens salad with the vinagrette was good. My second favorite part, and I'm not a salad fan at all.Overall, a decent place. Nothing special. My bill was 17 dollars, and I did not order a drink or anything. I like the feel of the restaurant, but honestly, I'll probably go somewhere else in the area before I head back here.",

For dinner we tried 4 of the 6 starters and all I have to say is that the hash browns were excellent and I could probably eat the pickled veggies every day and never tire of them. The Pate is a must try and the deviled eggs are just perfect. We tried 4 of the soups/salads and while I was not a fan of the seared pork belly, others at the table thought it was very good but the cheesy grits on the bottom were amazing. The cornbread was delightful (almost as good as Black Dog) and the chili just right. I look forward to trying the other items. The entrees were a great size and very well done. I had the pan seared fish which was perfectly cooked and had a side of pickled veggies. The cornbread stuffing on another plate was so good. The chicken was very tasty. The steak was cooked to a great temp. We also had the mac and cheese, they seem to understand that people like cheese and bacon because this dish did not disappoint. I plan on going for dinner many times. For lunch we were disappointed that the burger had already run out but we will have to go back earlier to try it. The steak sandwich was very good but the star on that plate was the Sweet Potato Chips, they were absolutely delicious. The horseshoe was very good and I especially enjoyed the sauce. I will be heading over there again for lunch very soon.This place is a great addition to downtown Champaign and a great replacement to Jim Gould's. The decor is very well suited to the atmosphere the place is trying to convey. I love that they expanded the bar. The prices are a bit high compared to some of the other places downtown but the food is of such a great quality that it is well worth the price.My biggest disappointment is that I am always too full to try the desserts because they look very good.",

                "review": "I have been to Big Grove a few times, with mixed results, but lunch today will be my last visit. Service:When we arrived, the restaurant was less than half full. Our server's name was Daniel. My friend and I ordered Chili Cheese Fries as an appetizer (I specified that we wanted it out first) and two sandwiches as the main course. About twenty minutes passed and our sandwiches came out, carried by a different server. I asked him about our appetizer and he had no idea. He found our server at the wait station, who then came over and without any apology told us that the kitchen had messed up our tickets. He returned with the app a minute later and mumbled something about the Chili Cheese Fries taking longer on average than the Cuban sandwich which I had ordered. The Cheese Fries were soggy and lukewarm. First of all, I absolutely hate it when a server blames the kitchen. It is so petty, and makes the whole restaurant look bad, especially at a place which supposedly prides itself on it's chef-driven sensibilities. Next, there is no way that a plate of chili fries takes longer than a Cuban sandwich. It was clear to me that the appetizer had sat in the window way too long, which is why it was tepid and soggy. This tells me that our app was finished by the kitchen in good time, and then just sat there until after our sandwiches had already been ran. No point having a chef in the kitchen if the food dies in the window. Even if the kitchen did screw up, which I highly doubt, the server is responsible for taking care of us and smoothing it over. Throwing the kitchen under the bus is a pathetic excuse. I cannot stand a person who won't take accountability for the mistakes. Next: Halfway through my sandwich, I decided to order a second beer, as the draught list there is excellent. Not only did our server fail to offer me a refill, but I COULD NOT get his attention. I spent over ten minutes waving my hands, trying to get him to our table. I'm going to repeat that this place was far from busy. I watched him bus tables, have personal conversations with other staff, and generally ignore us. I ended up flagging down the second server who ran our food, who took my order to Daniel (who was standing at the bar talking to staff.) After another five minutes, he managed to produce my order. Completely unsatisfactory. Fifteen minutes to order and receive a beer during a slow lunch is unbelievable. At this point, we had been seated for almost an hour. Daniel then dropped the check and returned our receipt with no kind words, apology, or gratitude for coming. We did not feel welcomed or taken care of at all. Simply some of the worst service I've had in CU. Food:Chili Cheese Fries would have been tasty had they been hot and fresh. No one likes soggy fries. Inattention ruined that dish. My Cuban was shy on meat and priced at $12. Destihl, right across the street, also offers a Cuban sandwich with way more meat priced at $10. The flavor with Grove's version was good, but the value sucked. My friend enjoyed her Grilled Cheese. Conclusion:  After a half-dozen visits over the last 18 months, both for lunch and dinner, we have not had one satisfactory meal, due to sub-par service.  There is no point sourcing your produce and protein from local farms if the kitchen is sabotaged by terrible service and high price-points. Over-hyped and not worth the money. This place is all hat and no cattle. We will not return and will tell everyone we know to avoid it.",

Sometimes it is a little slow, but servers are always friendly and do their best for you.The So-So: *menu tends towards fancified home cooking, which is not a bad thing.  But given that, it seems a bit overpriced for what you get.  The food we've had as been consistently okay, but not amazing.  Dinner?  Okay.  Brunch (which I really, really wanted to love)?  Again, just okay.  If you don't cook a lot at home, this can be a great place for you.  If you are a successful and inventive home cook, you might not be as impressed.  Con:**This is the thing that makes me not want to give Big Grove another chance.  We were in about 6 months ago (August), and both ordered the burger.  We requested some tomato to go with it, and the waitress came back- somewhat sheepishly, to her credit- and told us that the kitchen didn't serve it with tomato.  Okay.  I've been to fine dining restaurants, and I understand that chefs conceptualize the flavors of a dish in a particular way, and that's the way they want you to experience it.  But a burger?  And, more importantly, this burger?  It's fine, but it's not all that.  Perhaps they were just out of tomatoes?  But anyway, the fact that they were so proud of this burger keeps gnawing at me.  Overall:*Good drinks, fine ambience, good service.  In the greater scheme of things, they are still fairly new, so maybe they'll continue to evolve?  I hope so, because I'd love to see them reach a little bit higher; there seems to be potential for more here.",

Were facinated by the bar bits and starters, so decided to go with a nosh dinner had smelts, pickeled veggies, pate, parsnip and celery root soup, deviled eggs, chopped salad, and mac cheese.  All the food was good and for a newly opened restaurant the service was amazingly together.  We even had a wine by the glass which was corked and they fixed it without problem.  The wine list was not deep, but what they had was reasonably priced.All in all if you were looking for a gastro-pub in Champaign, this fits the bill.",

                "review": "I've been to Big Grove Taver for brunch and dinner before. If I'm not mistaken they have 3 different menu for brunch, lunch, and dinner. This place takes both reservation and walk-ins, which was very helpful during graduation weekend when all the restaurants are packed.First impression: the place is trendy - you can sit in the bar area, tables, booth, or even outside during the summer. During brunch people come in their sweatshirt and sweatpants, but the dinner crowd is more well-dressed. I had a good experience with the service everytime I go to this place. They serve you popcorn with spices of the day as a complementary snack.Dinner:I came here with my vegetarian friend so all the items we ordered from the menu is vegetarian!- Devilled eggs: delicious, but not dying for it- Chilled roasted beets: very very delicious - I honestly prefer the beets to the devilled eggs for appetizer- Roasted sunchoke risotto: Errr... It's just ok. I've had better risotto before. I think it's a little bland- Veggie mac and cheese: Also just ok. Among all 4 items we order, I like the beets the most!Brunch:To be fair, I've been ordering the same thing over and over again: CHILAQUILES. My mouth is literally watering as I am writing this. It is absolutely heavenly!!! The tortilla is well covered in spices and it is between crunchy and soft corn tortillas. The shredded chicken is so soft and it melts in my mouth! MUST TRY! The portion is very generous I usually can't finish the whole plate in one meal.My boyfriend had the eggs benedict before and he said it was good, but it's something you can find anywhere!Did I mention they have good selection of cocktails? LOVE THE BLOODY MARY!! Overall I give 3 stars for the dinner and 5 for the brunch and thus 4 stars!! It's also a good place to chill and drink on sat/ Friday night.",

Tonight was my 3rd visit, but first for dinner and i was very pleased!I had the Tavern Burger which is a beef, bison & pork burger, red onion marmalade, cornichon aioli, house-cut fries and added the Fried Egg.  I did not get the Aioli on my burger.  It was DELICIOUS!  for me the fried egg made this burger one of, if not THE best in Champaign/Urbana.  And i've had what is considered to be in the top 5 in america at Kuma's Corner in Chicago, its not that good, or that big, but its plenty excellent.  the house cut fries were very good too, i loved the seasoning.my wife raved about the Beer Brined Pork Loin, saying it was \"delicious\".  The place is a little pricy, but they also have very close attention to detail and the food is all from local area suppliers, which is a nice touch and compliment to the local growers.I will be back again at this restaurant, i can't wait to try the BLT with the egg at lunch next!",

                "review": "I was really close to leaving a 3 star review, but Big Grove pulled through in the end!My folks came down to visit and we wanted to grab some dinner. We got in at 4:30 and the server informed us we couldn't order dinner until 5, so we got a table and dissected the menu for ~30 minutes, ordered some drinks, and a bar snack or two.We opted to sit outside on a beautiful Sunday evening. Though I must mention the inside of Big Grove has a cool ambiance. Very dark/modern types of colors with some interesting tree/woodwork stuff hanging from the ceiling.Wine by the glass happened to be half off that evening, which was a pleasant surprise. I had a smoother French one which I forget the name of and my mother had a French Malbec, I tried to look them up online when I got home but it seems their wine list isn't 100% up to date online. Dad opted for a beer, the Left Hand Milk Stout Nitro, which ironically my roommate just ordered last weekend at Black Dog! He really enjoyed it but thought it wasn't served cold enough. No frosty glass, kind of a turn off for my Pops....We started with the deviled eggs and hushpuppies. The eggs were just OK and I thought the hush puppies were pretty tasty, especially with the sauce they came with! My mother said they were just fair.For dinner, my Uncle got the Free-Range chicken which he liked a lot. He particularly enjoyed the chicken jus as well as the dumplings that came with it. Mom and Dad split the short ribs, which they both thought were exceptional, and believe me, my mother is highly critical of short ribs, since she can cook up some mighty fine ones herself. I can verify via taste that these were not your average short ribs, I'd highly recommend these. On a last second split decision between the skirt steak and the pork tenderloin, I opted for the latter. This was also a really well put together dish that came with carrots, endive, and these glorious sweet potato hash brown patty things. The pork itself was done a perfect medium-rare and was flavorful, juicy and overall a nicely executed plate that would not have been the same without the creamy mustard sauce it was all sitting on.We did have some qualms which would have normally warranted only a 3 star review if it wasn't for how well everyone enjoyed their entrees. The beer I mentioned above could definitely have been served colder. Our server didn't seem to take the hint when my dad mentioned he liked frosty glasses. Our other major qualm would be the price to portion ratio. My parents split the short ribs and when they were finished they were still kind of hungry. Be warned, if you want to be at least a little full, don't share an entre, the portions are pretty small. The place is also comparably expensive, all of these entrees nearly required a $20 bill or more. We thought the clipboard menus were a little tacky for a place of this caliber.I do like the farm-to-table concept, I also really admire and respect Big Grove's local sourcing of foods. My only constructive criticism would be to actually put where each dish comes from on the menu, such as:\"Grilled Pork Tenderloin - Farm XYZ: _____, IL\".As an avid organic and local food fan, adding this type of notation makes me feel much better than simply, \"local\". Common Ground Co-Op in Urbana does a fairly good job of  this.Overall, a very pleasant dinner on a gorgeous day.",

I ate here twice on a visit, once for lunch and once for dinner, and was initially struck by the sheer beauty--and size--of the restaurant. It gets crazy busy on a Friday night and appears to be the only upscale bar in the area.Recommended dishes: 1) Veggie mac and cheese2) Chili: cup or bowl, cornbread on the side3) Lake Trout (I don't even like trout--it's my least favorite fish, likely because I have only had river trout with the bones and almonds and butter, but this was sublime with horseradish sauce)4) Pate which rivals the best I've eaten and is my personal favorite because it's mousse-like and light and not too heavy/strong but still exquisitely flavorful: it's better than the chicken livers at the Public Kitchen at Hollywood and served almost identically at a far lower price5) Fried grits--I know, this doesn't sound good at all but it has a chipotle aioli and for a decadent fried treat, you can't do better. I didn't know much about grits, as an LA girl, but apparently you can cook them without much fat and then unceremoniously dump a big hunk of butter on top so that it's like cream of wheat with butter, or you can do it more like the French with butter and cream, in which case it's far worse for you but tastes infinitely better. Executive chef Jessica Gorin subscribes to the second school of grit preparation and I wholly approve. 5) Beets: they were as good as the Purple Pig in Chicago but this is a \"bar bite\" (see below) so if you want a large portion, order two. 6) Chocolate bread pudding: this dessert rivals the Olio e Limone chocolate bread pudding with bananas which Julia Child cited as among her favorite desserts in Santa Barbara7) Pork belly: this has become trendy of late and some restaurants are pulling it from menus in big cities as people seem to be over it to some extent but Big Grove Tavern hits it out of the park with this appetizer. 8) Burger: some people in the area carped about the price of the burger here, not realizing that this is standard in LA and NYC (actually, their burger is cheaper than most fine dining burgers in cities I travel or live) and it's sheer perfection with the onions and cheese. The prices are reasonable and they offer a sort of mini-appetizer they call a \"bar bite,\" for 3 to 5 dollars. This is a nice option as you can try all sorts of sides for not a lot of money. The watercress soup was beautiful and subtle but the only dish on the menu that didn't send me into another galaxy. I truly believe Big Grove Tavern would be a hit in a city. In Champaign, which is a college town that feels infinitely smaller than it really is, with very few fine dining options, I see why the place is booming and if I lived in this tiny place, I'd eat here three times a week.",

They had an excellent beer selection, with several Midwest and even some local brews and seasonal ones. The bartender was very helpful and attentive. The night we went, they had recently roasted an entire pig, so their specials were these amazing pork dishes. I enjoy pork quite a bit - beer and pork - since I've lived in Berlin and love German cuisine, so this place made me really happy. Based on my one visit, I'd recommend this place to all my friends and family, and anyone visiting from out of town.",

We were advised that if we didn't have a reservation we would be sitting outside or at the bar due to a 45 minute wait.  Note that at the time we arrived 80% of the tables inside were empty - no problem, we enjoy sitting outdoors.  Side note: forty-five minutes later there are still twelve empty tables inside...We enjoyed the cumin flavored popcorn and ordered a wedge salad to share.  The wedge salad needs a little help (extra crumbles please) but the bacon had a distinct full smokey flavor and was very good.  We requested salt and pepper and they brought it out in little stainless dishes.  My wife ordered the scallops and I ordered the flank steak.  The scallops (four) were exceptionally good - flavorful and delicious.  The cornbread was just ok.  The flank steak was marginal but ok - served with delicious sides.  The wine and beer list is solid - lots of good choices.Good table service - steak could have been brought out hot off the grill but can't have it all.  My wife was unimpressed overall - note the menu prices are high. The atmosphere is upscale overall and the food presentation is excellent.  The menu options are limited.  The music is questionably appropriate for dinner but not offensive.",

Then the steak comes out, and it was way too salty. The sauce was too salty as it is, and then they added sea salt on it. When I told my waiter about it, some manager lady in her 40-50s came and took it back to have it redone. She did not apologize but instead shrugged and said \"that's the way we cook it here\";  face was stone cold and gave us a new set of silveware without saying a word. Talk about customer service. I do not know how this place stays in business with a manager like this. Bottom line is, if you're looking for a quick eat, then the food here is ok, comparable to steak and shake quality but 3x the price. If you're unlucky enough like me to see that manager with an attitude, then you're in for an experience.",

The pretzel came with a 'honey mustard' where the main ingredient wad horseradish. The steak was terrible quality and chewy and not prepared as requested and the sides were bitter. I came here for their awesome dessert menu and after trying the food,  I was too afraid to order one.  There are a lot of good restaurants in champaign urbana. Don't waste your money here.",

I had the trout dish last time and was extremely disappointed with the tiny piece of fish in the center of the huge plate it was served on. Not much flavor, not satisfying. The only menu item I would recommend is the Tavern burger. The service here is soooo slow. I took my mom here when she was visiting last month, wanting to give this place another try since the restaurant overall does have a nice atmosphere inside compared to other nearby places. Unfortunately I was disappointed again. It took our waiter too long to greet our table and then again too long to bring us our drinks. I ordered a pecan beer that he had suggested and when I tasted the beer, it seemed a little off but I figured that was just the flavor of it. Our meal took about an hour and a half to come out...and all we had ordered was a burger and the free range chicken dish. I think our waiter had forgotten to put in our orders till later. The couple seated next to us after we arrived had their meals a half hour before we did. When the check arrived, I see that my beer was in fact a $10 cider, not a $5 beer. Guess my taste buds were right. We paid the bill and left without complaining because we didn't feel like being there any longer than we were. Look, I understand things go wrong in restaurants and the server can't always control how long food takes and mistakes can be made. I am a server so I've been there. But I would've appreciated it if our server tried to do something to make up for our lackluster experience here. Not coming back here.",

If it were less expensive; maybe more in line with Blackdog or Dublin O'Neils prices it may have gotten 4 stars (whereas those other restaurants get 5 stars and 4 stars respectively). We started off with some deviled eggs that were good, and a fresh baked pretzel that had an unappealing mustard sauce.  I'll take Gulden's over that mustard sauce any day.  I ordered the burger and my girlfriend ordered a chicken salad sandwich.The burger was actually pretty good, cooked medium, with an egg and some onion maramalade on it.  The fries were decent but nothing to write about.The chicken salad was just a terrible sandwich.  Maybe one small scoop of flavorless chicken salad on hard toast for $9?  Get that thing off the menu.  Seriously.  People who order that sandwich will not come back.   The sweet potato chips on the side were pretty tasty though.Overall, not as great as I had hear, though maybe the chicken salad ruined the experience.  You want a burger, go to Blackdog or Farrens for a comparable one that costs half the price.  Want chicken salad better than this, go to your local gas station and buy a pre-made chicken salad.All that said, I'll give it another try.",

The place was quiet, only a few tables were full. Waitress was very kind and friendly, took our order promptly. When the food arrived, Mom got her soup along with her entree at the same time. By the time she finished her soup the entree was cold. No big deal, we thought, let's ask the waitress to re-heat. Unfortunately our waitress paid little attention to us and kept disappearing for long stretches. Eventually someone else reheated the entree for Mom. When the waitress brought the check she offered to box up our leftover dessert (huge portion). We thanked her and she took the cake away to be boxed ...and never returned.  I'd say 3 stars for food, 1 for service.",

She said she'd bring one right back, and then forgot (I watched her stand at the host stand, bored). Took 5 minutes to get one from waiter. This is the kind of thing you'd forgive as a fluke, but you watch and see table-waiting basics being flubbed all over the place. Last time, I watched *three* different customers standing up and approach a waiter stand asking to find their waiter. My service was slow, and didn't anticipate common needs (like a coffee refill at breakfast).My food came out partially cold and partially hot, which is either a kitchen timing issue or a tardy waiter who left food sitting in the window too long.Seeing as it doesn't seem to be one bad server, I'd guess this the result of poor training--which is usually a management issue.If you can survive the service, the hip/classy atmosphere has rich dark wood, orange lighting, and attractive window bays looking at Memorial Stadium on the south tip of campus. The menu items I've had have been either decent or great.Worth a try, I suppose, but bring patience.",

While I do appreciate live music- it's just too loud if you are trying to speak to each other during dinner.",

Based on my prior experiences, I knew to keep my expectations low.  Instead, I had a great time.  I came back a few days later and had another pleasant meal.  As far as chain restaurants go, Houlihan's ranks well above average.  I've skimmed the other reviews, and I can't be sure if I've just been lucky, but I certainly didn't suffer the problems of other customers (e.g., bland food, poor service).Lunch options are generously portioned and reasonably priced.  Complimentary soup or salad is served with entrees, sandwiches/wraps, and pizzas.  I've tried the baked potato soup and chicken tortilla soup and have trouble picking a favorite; both are savory and very thick/hearty.  If you're concerned about skimpy salads, each of the signature salads come with a healthy proportion of greens-to-\"toppings\" (candied pecans, Gorgonzola cheese, chicken, etc.).The tapas-style menu really makes this a fun spot for happy hour.  There are a LOT of options here (more than 40+), ranging in size from small to medium to entree-size.  You'll find something, even if you're a picky eater (and Houlihan's takes special consideration if you mention being gluten-intolerant, vegetarian/vegan, etc.).  I love being able to pick out a few things to share with friends, but I can also see this as a great option if you have a light appetite and want truly modest portions of rich mashed potatoes or filling pasta.  (Or if you have a diverse appetite and just want to eat bites of a lot of different things!)  You can get small, \"appetizer\"-sized portions of their mac-and-cheese (yum!), grilled skewers, asparagus salad, and white bean hummus (DELISH).  I eat hummus as an appetizer at many places, and while they vary in success, I found Houlihan's hummus with grilled pita to be plate-lickingly GOOD (surprising especially for a chain!).The other essential element for happy hour are drinks, and Houlihan's is stocked with a full bar, along with a menu of suggested cocktails.  Some of these drinks are more sophisticated, compared to the corn-syrupy messes you get served at most chain restaurants.  For women watching their weight, Houlihan's also serves a number of fruity drinks from the \"Skinny Girl\" brand (great for minimizing the damage that restaurants can do to your diet).",

                "review": "Houlihan's is kind of a pseudo fine dining version of a TGI Friday's.  The menu is similar to what I would expect from TGI Friday's, but the decor is a lot more trendy right down to the super obnoxious aluminum menus.  Although the menu items are fairly pedestrian, they have little twists (chevre on the bruschetta instead of the more expected mozzarella, for example) and there is a big focus on presentation.  This makes for wonderful looking food, but the taste doesn't quite hit the mark.  Some of the cool looking little food sculptures are also very difficult to eat.  My bruschetta came with a little minced olive tower that looked like a cross between a wine cork and something out of the cat box, which was none to appetizing.Most of the food I had tasted OK, but the fried asparagus stands out as being notably bad. One of my pet peeves is tough asparagus, and the stuff here was enough to make me go postal.  It was over breaded, over cooked, and the asparagus was actually chewy.  Gross.  I couldn't bite through the asparagus, so when I tried to eat it, the asparagus slid out of the breading leaving a pile of greasy panko straws on the plate.  The horseradish dipping sauce was good, but lacked zing.  At $10 for a dozen bad pieces of asparagus, this should definitely be skipped.As is usually the case with chains, the menu descriptions made the food sound divine but the taste did not live up to it.  It's not bad, mind you, it's just forgettable.  This was particularly the case with the \"mini desserts,\" which are actually full sized desserts; one is plenty for two people.  Thinking they were much smaller than they turned out to be, we got a $6 trio of pecan pie, banana cream pie, and chocolate cake.  All were very cold as if they had just been removed from a long stay in the fridge.  All were also very bland and had terrible texture.  The pies were both runny, and the chocolate cake was dry and made Hostess cupcakes look gourmet.  Like everything else, they looked fabulous, and were also very reasonably priced, but don't let that fool you.  They're really not worth it.  So overall, I give Houlihan's a resounding \"meh.\"  It's not bad, but I certainly didn't find it to be particularly good.  I'm giving three stars because the service was better than I would expect from a newer place so close to campus, and they definitely deserve credit for having such a well trained and capable staff.",

I don't drink alcohol, so I ordered lemonade ($2.50, and it was just ok - not very tangy), and a cup of their potato soup, and house salad with blue cheese (each $3.95). I can't believe they don't have light French dressing......this is criminal.I was disappointed that the server couldn't keep the salad orders straight; unfortunately, two of us ordered salads with white dressings; her's ranch, mine blue cheese (since there was no French dressing!). The other gal had to serve as 'taste tester' to determine which salad had ranch and which had blue cheese dressing.For $11.26 (plus my decent tip since I'm not usually bitchy unless the service is really really bad!) I don't think I will likely return to Houlihans on my own free will. If however, someone really wanted to meet me there, I might go for the company and stop at McD's on my way home.",

I've always had good experiences at Houlihan's in other towns, so I was excited that Champaign was not only getting one, but that it would actually be located on the south side of town near my home instead of the urban blight that is North Prospect. But sadly, my experiences there have been haphazard at best. One time the food will be good and the service atrocious. Then the next, the service will be friendly (if not terribly professional or well-trained) and the food will just be downright BAD. I had a really exceptionally good lunch experience about a month ago--best server I've had in any Champaign restaurant in a LONG time--and the food was really good that day, too. (I'm sure this young lady would not take a plate out of the kitchen if it didn't meet her exacting standards, so I give her partial credit there, too). But then a couple of weeks later I stopped in with my son for lunch on a Sunday and had a pretty bad time of it. (The lettuce in my salad had been frozen and was limp. The iced tea had that 'old' oxidized taste. Blech. His burger was cooked to the consistency of a doorstop.). So sad. Consistency is what gains a restaurant success. And the chef and the front of house manager BOTH need to have incredible expectations and hold their people to that EVERY SINGLE DAY.  Furthermore, they need to train, train, train, and train so their people know what those expectations are and how they can meet them and exceed them. I'll keep going back, of course. I want this place to succeed. I want it to represent Champaign-Urbana to all the people who stay in the hotel or attend a conference or cheer on the Illini at a game. I have hope, because there is SO much potential. Houlihan's has all the ingredients to make a great, fun restaurant. They just need to have the right people putting together the recipe.",

The tilapia was thickly crusted with something, with little specks of what may have been almonds. I asked to have my steak redone and to their credit they obliged, agreeing it was not done correctly. As my wife picked the mystery crust off her fish, my steak was redone. The second steak appeared promising (sear marks visible), but the cook obviously did not time or let the steak rest because this time it was rare (raw).

They then moved us to the bar area and sat us on 4 different round high top tables. Whatever, we can make that work.We all ordered our drinks and it took over 20 minutes for them to all be delivered. Mind you, many of us just ordered water to start with as we were going to be going out afterwards. 20 minutes is just insane to wait for water!Another 20 minutes goes by and our waiter (who's name I never caught) FINALLY came to take our orders. We knew it would take awhile for our food so we all sat and chatted. Food finally started coming out and as it came out he had no idea who ordered what, so we had to figure out what was on the plate and who ordered it. My food was alright, though at first it didn't come with the potato's that I ordered. Instead of just bringing me a side, he took my entire plate back and came back with mashed potato's very haphazardly placed on the side.One of our diners didn't get their food until almost everyone had already eaten. She ordered chicken tenders...they aren't that difficult to make!So up until this point we were all a bit peeved but could deal with it.The real disaster hit when he went to give us our tickets. Out of 15 checks, only 2 of them were right. He charged a pregnant lady 2 alcoholic beverages! It's not like he just gave her the wrong ticket, she was the only one that ordered what she got! So he just had no idea who ordered what.I got my check and it had an iced tea on it that I didn't order. He took my check to take it off and I didn't get a new check for another 30 minutes. I almost walked out without paying because we were getting tired of waiting, but I'm an honest person and I wouldn't have felt right leaving without paying.FINALLY the manager came out to assist him. Why wasn't she there the entire time? I have no idea! But she was about as much help as a log. She apologized, of course. But did we get any sort of compensation? Nope. She did decide to send the person that the party was in honor of a gift card to come back. Something tells me that gift card will go unused. I know I will never return to this establishment.Why was that poor waiter left on his own with a party of 15? Why didn't ANYONE help him? I saw at least 3 or 4 waiters pass by our table and not a single one of them thought that maybe he was struggling. Now, don't get me wrong...our waiter was about as personable as a stick in the mud, but still...we couldn't help but feel sorry for him, he obviously had no support from management.Get it together, Houlihan's. If you can't handle a 15 top, don't allow them. I doubt ANY of us will ever return to your establishment. And you really put a damper on what was supposed to be a really awesome night for our bride-to-be.",

This is especially true if you're visiting offices in the research park. In such cases Houlihan's will be by far your most convenient dining option. I stayed at the I-Hotel last year when interviewing for my current job, and ate at Houlihan's both for dinner and breakfast. I don't even remember what I ordered for dinner, but I remember it being of good quality. Service was pretty attentive. They had live music that evening, but I left just as they were beginning. I don't know what the prices were because I didn't pay.Breakfast was another story. The breakfast buffet was almost empty, so I actually had to ask the staff if I came at the wrong time. The lack of customers means all the hot items were cold and obviously not fresh. The scrambled eggs were stale and quite disgusting. I really regretted having breakfast here, even if it was only $9.",

My steak was perfectly cooked and was served with a side of broccolini and a dab of buttery sauce for only $10!!  The 8 oz fillet is only $25 and comes with sides and a salad so that's not a bad deal either. I also had breakfast here this morning and was very satisfied with my scrambled eggs and bacon.

The food was of a poorer quality that one would expect from a fast food restaurant, though the prices said otherwise. The service form the waiter was poor from start to finish, and I never once got a refill on my drink. Next time I stay at the hotel, I will definitely be driving elsewhere to dine.

We waited around for at least five minutes before flagging another server down to finally get a table.  I also gotta say, the drinks here (besides the long islands) are expensive!  They're about twice as expensive as other/nicer Houlihan's I've been to.  It must be because it's connected to the hotel.  Anyways, the food was hit and miss.  My bf ordered the panko shrimp.  Everything was perfect and delicious except for the coleslaw, which was like shredded cabbage and mayo that had been mixed two seconds before so it wasn't marinated at all.  I had the seared sea scallops.  Sadly, the scallops were more like bay scallops.  Pretty tiny in comparison to the same entree I got at a different location a few days earlier.  At least they were perfectly cooked, since the risotto was a fail.  It was starchy and unappetizing.  Needless to say, I doubt I will be returning to this location though Houlihan's is one of my favorite restaurant chains.",

If it was $7.95 or so I think that it would be a better deal but the food is really good. At dinner time they have a menu that included mac and cheese for $6 and it is GREAT!!!! This is a place worth going!!",

Arriving at 9:00AM, the continental breakfast table was in no was appealing.  The cereals (cheerios and raison bran) were spilled all over the table.  The 2\" x 1\" fruit cup had only  2 different kinds of melon.  The \"pastry\" plate consisted of 2 very small slices of unidentifiable pound cake and the one selection of pastry was broken up in teeny tiny pieces so as not to be recognized.   You also had the choice to toast white or whole grain bread (2 pieces were left), and add butter and or jelly.  The selection of beverages were regular coffee (not hot and no decaf), water, orange and apple juice.  The silverware was in short supply, 2 forks and no knifes, but plenty of spoons.  Upon me asking if they were going to replenish the table, they said yes and added more scones, pound cake to the \"pastry\" plate and fruit cups.  No other rectifications.  The first booth I sat at, the table was all sticky as though they wiped the table with syrup on the rag.  The second table was still sticky, but not nearly as bad.  The \"floor staff\" were 2 college age girls who both appeared to have gotten out of bed too early and were not particularly happy to be there.My opinion...don't bother.",

The french onion soup was really good and the chips and salsa were OK.  All in all it was a good free meal.  The server was attentive and the atmosphere pleasant.  Very clean and chic.",

Much lower key than Legends, Murphy's has the unique feel of being open to anyone willing to take a step out of their dorm roomsYou can't call your bar-hop night a barcrawl if you don't stop here. The food is good, the drinks cheap, and the people are always merry in Murphy's. I will miss every night I've remembered, or forgotten here.",

Their burgers made me real sick once but I got over it. If I'm going to a campus bar, Murphy's is my first choice. Plus they have lots of seating for us lazies.",

The place caters to the average college-aged individual who is content to fraternize with his or her colleagues over inexpensive alcoholic beverages and greasy diner food. While classier than the average campus-town bar, Murphy's by no means rivals the sophistication of the surrounding bars of downtown Champaign and Urbana. Classically, Murphy's tends to be more popular among the graduate and older undergraduate students, but that doesn't deter alumni and non-student patrons from frequenting. The beer selection outmatches any other bar on the University of Illinois campus and it is a bargain cost-wise compared to the non-campus bars. Food is typically served until 11 p.m. each night, with one of the most popular dishes being the \"Irish Nachos\" - essentially a whole plate of waffle fries decked with nacho toppings that you'll need a friend or two to finish. A host of burgers and other fried foods are also available with various specials throughout the week.  I have nothing but the fondest memories of Murphy's Pub. There's nothing ritzy about it, but if you're open to having (or reliving!) a fun yet relaxing college night, Murphy's is the place for you!",

If it's a weekend, the youngins usually find plenty of parties to attend so that's less of a problem, unless its moms or dads weekend where it can fill up just as quickly. They don't even serve their regular menu on nights like this which can be frustrating if you forget about campus life from time to time.

                "review": "Drinks: I'm 75% sure they use Sprite-type drink in their gin and tonic. They use gigantic glasses of mixer with a single standard shot. We also ordered shots separately and each shot was $2 for 0.5 fl oz. I was stunned. I have not really ventured to campus bars in my three-and-a-half years here because I consistently have bad experiences. 0.5 fl oz for a shot is the next level of low. Most campus bars at least pretend to not be totally lost and call 1 oz a shot... But 0.5 just leaves me speechless. Standard shot, you guys, is 1.5 fl oz. Nowhere else have I seen a recipe for mixed drink with an 8 to 1.5 mixer to liquor ratio. That's basically spiked Sprite. My point is, they have -1000 drink craftsmanship. Which is fine since apparently you're supposed to lower your standards on campus. But what really gets me is that they sell 0.5 oz dribbles of liquor and call it a shot... Food: Food service is poor though the food is fairly good. We waited an unusually long time for two burgers. We began to think something was wrong so we peeked into the kitchen (after asking a server and having to wait more) and it looked like the cook was cooking away... And then he ate the food. I get it... If I were working all night I'd get hungry too. But it's kind of strange delaying orders for an absurdly long time so that the cook can prepare and eat food from scratch.",

It's really fresh! My college buddies and I returned to this old college hotspot to reminisce on old times. We used to come for Mug Night on Wednesdays so this place brings back great memories.It's been 8 years since I've been here, so I was really surprised when the food and beer was actually better than I remembered!  First of all, I already mentioned their beer on tap. it's quality and fresh! and low cost. Secondly, their burgers still rock in an awesome way! I had their Turkey burger while my friends had the regular cheeseburgers. Man oh man these burgers are juicy and seculent. The turkey burger is well flavored and succulent.  We basically scarfed down our meals including the yummy fries. Another good thing is that they also expanded this place - it used to be way too crowded but they added a whole other section to this place. They have a nice layout with table sizes that comfortably accomodate anywhere from 4 to parties in the teens. I love their spacious bench seat tables. If you're visiting U of I, definitely hit up this place! It's a cherished favorite.",

Sat at the bar, and had to ask the bartender if he could please wipe off the bar in front of me because it was all messy - you would have thought I called him mother a dirty name.  Service here was terrible.The burger?  Much smaller than I remember.  The fries, barely edible....they were like eating balsa wood that had been deep fried.  All in all, a terrible meal.

Becomes increasingly less acceptable during weekends to the point where it actually is unsanitary and you can't hear anyone talking over the noise.

I came in on a Thursday so perhaps it was a special day, but all their drafts (And they had a surprisingly good list for a college bar) were $2.  What a deal!A few people in the group ordered food and said it wasn't bad.  I cannot vouch or review the food as I did not partake.  From seeing the burgers, they looked pretty decent actually.  The process of ordering food was interesting.  There are no servers.  You go up to the food window, put in your order and give a name.  They then call your name over a PA system to the whole bar.  The speakers from this PA system sound like they came from the 70s when all you hear is squelching noise.  We pretty much looked over at the food window to see if it was us anytime the garbled noise came over the speakers.All in all this place is a dive.  If you want this type of thing, go for it!  If you want something a bit more upscale with servers and non-bar food, try somewhere else.  Personally, I'll be back for the cheap beers next time I am in town!",

Sometimes it's great and there aren't any problems. But if it's crowded things quickly go downhill from there. For example, the last time I was there, I ordered Irish Nachos without bacon (because I'm vegetarian). The order (which is just fries with cheese and nacho toppings) took an hour. Once I got my order, it had bacon on it but I didn't send it back because I was so sick of waiting. Regardless to say, it definitely ruined the night to spend an hour hungry and waiting on food and then having to pick all of the bacon off.",

It's a very chill bar but at the same time can be crazy fun with some great music and good company. The jukebox there is always a fun way to get the night going and they always have a huge selection of songs to choose from. Also, it's the place to be these days on Thursday nights, as the lines can get insanely long and have up to 30-40 min wait times depending on the night. So my advice to you would be to arrive around 9pm-9:30pm to avoid any lines, cause as soon as 10 o'clock rolls around, you'll be waiting a little bit to get in.The specials are always nice, with the $7 killians on Thursday and $2 Pints for Bluemoon, how could you go wrong? Also, with the new area that opened up, the wait for drinks has gone down to much shorter. Love the new space and the addition of the air-hockey table in the basement as well. In addition, the food is delicious! Best burgers and fries on campustown. The double-cheeseburger deal on Wednesdays (i think, might have to check on this) is amaziiinnnng.  Overall, this bar is chill and fun at the same time. It's not as chill as Legends (granted Legends may have more seating) but I don't think you'll get the same experience when comparing the bars.",

I was excited to see that they had spicy cheese bites which thrilled me because growing up in Wisconsin consuming cheese curds while at the bar is a must. These were a rendition of the cheese curd but a very sub par one. The cheese inside was not hot enough so the cheese didn't squish out when eating them, it just kind of stuck to the breading. Next off, I had the burger. I ordered the mushroom burger which was the Tuesday special. When I got my burger it had no mushrooms on it and the cheese was barely melted. The topping such as the pickles, lettuce, tomato, and onion were fresh. The fries were mediocre at best. Coming in at 1:15 in the afternoon I didn't expect the place to have a big crowd but it was far too quite; No music was even playing.",

SERVICE IS TERRIBLE they are incredibly rude. 1st examplestanding at the bar watching a football game holding my money out on the counter so bartender knows i want a drink. next thing i know the bartender is in my face \"waving your money around wont get you served faster\". What the hell, i was standing there holding it on the bar, i wasn't even looking at you i was watching tv. 2nd examplecrowded for unofficial so i'm sure they are stressed. close out my tab, paid with a credit card but was going to leave a cash tip. Still reaching for my wallet bartender looks at 50 dollar tab with no tip. \"hey buddy, thats really a jerk thing to do, thanks\" again, what the hell! can i reach in my wallet to give you the cash, needless to say i said yeah your right and left without tipping. 3rd exampleusually the irish nachos are covered in toppings, most recent time hardly any. go back up to counter, its sunday no one is there so its not like its busy. Can i get some more toppings please i didn't get very much. Guy looks at me like i just punched his mother. answers slowly \"yeah... i guess i can\". he was pissed. Dude calm down i just want more toppings, didn't say it was terrible, get over yourself. thank god i love this place. except the servers. and not all are bad, just most.",

The best nights at Murphy's are Wednesdays and Thursdays.Wednesday is logo night so you can grab a pint and keep the glass for under $5 and refills are only $2.50 I think. Phenomenal deal. My cabinets are full of awesome logo glasses thanks to Murphy's. Thursdays are phenomenal because it's $2 pints. Any pint for just $2. You'll never beat that. I hear they may have upped it to $2.50 but that's a good variety of decent quality pints for just $2.50. Go out with a $10 bill and you'll have an awesome night. That simple, that's all you need.",

They're appropriately greasy, and when on special you can't beat the price. The chicken fingers leave something to be desired but, hey, it's not perfect.What you go to Murphys for is the beer. The draft list is surprisingly extensive, and while the selection of hard alcohol is weak (says the guy who's finished a whiskey passport at Seven Saints), the specials are fantastic (you can normally get a double of either Beam or Wild Turkey for $5 or less) and they have specialty pints for $2.50 on Thursdays. And it's not bad beer either. I normally get Fat Tire or Angry Orchard, but they even have some decent IPA's on tap (sayeth my beer snob friends). Murphy's is often crowded, and for graduate students, there's a very real risk of running into students, but it's my favorite place in Campustown and a really good bar overall.",

Wednesday is Logo Glass Night, and I have several boxes of the great glasses I accumulated over the years.Their beers on tap is great, especially for a campus bar.  The food is pretty good pub grub, but I believe there is a \"game-day menu\" where only certain things are served, which is kind of a bummer if you want Irish nachos on game-day because it's not on the menu.  The jukebox is great (every fricking song by The Black Keys can be found on there) and there are loads of flat screens to catch whatever game is on.  If you get there early, you won't even have to pay a cover.",

You go in and order at the bar, and then walk to the back where they prepare your order to pick it up.There's usually no cover here at night (with the exception of special occasions such as Unofficial, Mom's/Dad's weekend, etc.) and have good, knowledgeable bartenders.  There's a wide selection of beers - over 25 I believe? - and they make a kickass Amaretto Sour (my fav next to Irish Car Bombs, btw, so you should buy me one if you see me out at the bars ever ^__~, they're like a Starburst in a glass!).  Like all the other bars, this place gets quite crowded on weekends and as everyone else here has commented on, the jukebox is loud and, at $1 a song, gets heavy use/abuse.  Some of the stuff that comes out of that thing... I don't know, man... =PThe specials here are also pretty sweet - yay for logo glass night.  Overall, it's just a great campus bar to frequent anytime.",

It was a sunday and we wanted to catch the NFL games so, naturally, we went up to a bar. Murphy's was our 3rd choice (after the other 2 bars were either closed or not showing any games). The place was empty (not surprising coming from a college town where all they care about is Saturday Football) except for a couple of old guys talking to themselves.They had a lot of TVs and only one game on, when we asked them to switch it they couldn't because they didn't own the football package -strike one-Despite the place being deserted our server never took our order and we had to go up to the bar to have them take it. There is some controversy about this, as some bars will have you do that in the early evening but I've been to bars in the middle of nowhere at the same time where this wasn't the case. Either way, that was a bit annoying, so strike two.Strike three came along when after ordering we had to pick up our own food at the kitchen. At that point we gave up on good expectations and simply sat down to watch the game.The good news is their food is amazing. My friend and I are no fans of fries either but man they were awesome! And their bean burger was gigantic and extremely good according to my friend, while I had the steak sandwich and that was absolutely perfect.In any case, chances are the place is legit on Saturday Game Day, but it's up to you if you want to try it out.",

The inside is pretty big, there's a few different rooms and even a downstairs that we didn't get a chance to check out.We shot a few games of pool and were able to have decent conversation due to the music being at an actually reasonable volume. They had several drink specials, I was able to get a Harp for $2.50 and McGillicudy shots were only $2 also. I'll have to come back when the Guinness is on special (if it ever is).The only thing I wasn't too happy about was the service. It was quite slow. It seemed like they were a little understaffed.

The expansion has made it much easier to walk around the bar on the weekend nights when everyone is cramming in. Finding seating is less of a rat race, but I'd still say to arrive earlyish if you don't want to be standing.  The bathrooms can get a little sketchy, but I pretty much expect that from a campus bar.

Drinks are cheap too, decent draft beer selection for a campus bar, and it's surprisingly not that hard to snag a table (there are a whole bunch of them).  I've had many an evening here, dancing in that space in front of the jukeboxes.  And you should know that this is not a place where a lot of people dance - it's mostly just people drinking, probably shaking their heads and laughing at my friends and I dancing around like idiots to Bon Jovi.  But you know, Murphy's just makes me feel comfortable enough to do that.  The jukebox blows on busy nights though - even if you pay extra for \"play next,\" like 10 other people already did that so you might not hear your songs at all.  And you'll probably have to sit through a lot of stupid crap that other people picked out before you get to any good music.  I guess it just depends on the crowd.

A long bar, some tables up front, and bar games like pool and shuffleboard towards the back.  A beer garden that has hosted plenty of bands.  Anybody from the Boat Drunks to Tons of Fun Band.  Plenty of TV's that put a premium on Illini sports.  I will always remember watching the Illinois/Arizona NCAA game during the 04-05 season here.  Service suffers depending on how many people are here, and what is going on.  Food has always been generic pub grub, but just slightly better food than a dive bar should have.Always a fun time.  A place that should at least be given a try, and if it is not for you, there are always plenty of other spots around town.",

                "review": "I give Fat City Saloon five stars because they are excellent at what the strive to be:  A saloon.  The menu consists of simple, classic pub food that has been prepared exceptionally well.  They don't offer anything fancy, but they use high-quality ingredients and prepare it competently.  On Fridays, they offer a beer-battered fish sandwich that simply has to be tasted to be believed.  I would walk a mile on my lips for one of their fish sandwiches and would love to see it on the regular menu.  Skip's grilled cheese is another favorite, but don't expect the kids' classic sandwich as this is a grown-up version with three kinds of cheese, tomatoes, and bacon.The service is extremely friendly and generally quite competent.  Another reviewer reported some bad experiences with service on the two occasions on which he had visited, but I've had nothing but exemplary and friendly service, and I've been going there regularly for many years (both before they closed and again after they re-opened).  I will routinely order carry out lunch with a group of friends; and yes, there have been some minor mix-ups on our order.  But we order from a lot of different places for carry-out or delivery, and they have done better than every other restaurant in town in accuracy, and we typically order anywhere from 4-12 entrees.  On those rare occasions when something was messed up, they corrected it immediately, cheerfully, and then didn't charge for the messed up orders.  ALL restaurants have bad days when everything seems to go wrong, and they handle theirs better than most.They have a well-stocked bar and an excellent beer list; I don't drink wine all that often any more, so I keep forgetting to check out the wine list.  I don't go to Fat City to drink or hang out, but when I've stayed there to eat, the sound system has been perfectly fine.  Also, the restrooms are clean and well lit.  I've never had to wait for a drink, and when I'm drinking iced tea or soda, my glass has never been allowed to hit empty before I get a free refill.  I frequently go to Fat City for lunch, often making a separate trip from Mahomet where I live just to eat there.  As the name would imply, I wouldn't go there if I were on a strict, low-fat diet; but if you want excellent, no-frills pub food, this place is awesome.",

If having fun is not your thing, check out Fat City.My second time here confirmed in spades the general feeling of badness I got the first visit. The first time (~a year ago) was a weekend night and they had a lot of people. All the garbage that comes with a large, half and half campusy crowd was there that time. They had keg service outside in a busted little shed (plastic cups, long lines, beer foam splashing all over, and a full compliment of asshats). Inside, the place doesn't *look* that bad. They have dark wood accents, a selection of booths, tables, and a long bar. They have 2 nice pool tables, a shuffle puck table (you dont have to pay for the machine to keep score ... there's an app for that now), a new golden tee, and a couple of other games that looked playable. The second time I went was a Tuesday night. I realize Tuesday is a polarizing night for bars, but I am solidly in the camp of lovers of bars on the empty side. A group of grad students I run with had called ahead letting the place know we would be coming en masse. Many of this crew refused to come, (I surmise based upon how terrible this bar is). So we had about 80 less people there than we warned them about ahead of time. So the service was great, right? Nope. The worst I've experienced in Champaign-Urbana. Drinks took literally 20 minutes. One bartender with ADHD had \"a system\" for remembering what everybody had was running around like a chicken with his head cut off. The guy was really trying, but he did not do his job efficiently at all: he would ask you what you wanted, listen to the very first thing you said, then turn away and 'get right on it' before you were done talking. He would then stop preparing your drink order mid-way to take care of somebody else and their extended family. He would then serve up your drink and act like you were the jerk because you wanted two additional drinks. Those three drinks will cost you $9 plus 20-35 minutes of your life. This 'system' led to a half-dozen or more people at any given time stuck in the purgatory between ordering a drink(s), receiving said drink(s) and paying for same.The music system sucks. A really muddy sound that makes old standards hardly understandishable, and the bar artificially loud. In the nearly empty bar described above, it was hard to hear even those near to you, and doubly hard to communicate with the bartender. It was easier to hear elsewhere, but they must put the speakers over the bar (so the bartender can't hear complaints?).The food sucks. Terrible selection of boring pub grub standards of BBQ'd meat, fried meat, crappy frozen crinkle cut fries. On Tuesday, they have $2.00 margaritas that are TERRIBLE. Bottom-shelf tequila plus too-much bottom shelf margarita mix over ice (no blend option).Oh yeah, there is an old guy sitting at the end of the bar talking loudly to himself. The aforementioned sound quality makes this even creepier, as only occasional strains of his soliloquy find their way through the muddy garbage music they play here (Classic Rawk 2 steps below NOW!). I really thought about giving this place 2 stars for the following reasons: $4 bottles of good beers, (like Rogue Dead Guy and Bell's Oberon) and a shuffle puck table/new Golden Tee. Pre-Yelping the place in my head I was resigned to give them 2 stars as a recognition of such efforts, even if they were not reflected in positive results. Then my buddy got his Blue Moon draft in a plastic cup.",

While I don't think that $18 a person is too much for a nice brunch every once in awhile, i do expect to get what I pay for.I don't want to be ignored by the hostess, then treated rudely by both her and the waitress.  Additionally, I expect the food to be restocked.  If you own a restaurant and advertise that brunch is offered until 2:30, the brunch should be stocked until that time.  If you want to stop stocking the brunch at 1:00, the advertise that the brunch ends at 1:00.  The good foods were omelets and waffles, smoked salmon and shrimp; the two things I could get cooked fresh, and the two things that are served best cold.  Everything else was cold, crusty crap.We were rushed by the waitress who couldn't be bothered to refill our drinks.  Busboys were texting, no one would check us out when it was time to pay.  In fact, the only nice people there were the bartender and the omelet chef.  I liked this place in the past, and if I have another chance to come back, I will...so I guess the have a chance to gain some stars.",

It's never my choice-- Champaign has a handful of restaurants where everyone goes when they're looking for a somewhat upscale experience and Silvercreek falls into this category. And so I find myself here for graduation celebrations, birthdays, meals for when relatives are visiting, and so on. Most of my experiences here have been for their Sunday buffet brunch. They offer your standard biscuits, gravy, bacon, potatoes, as well as some lunch-ier fare like pasta and prime rib. It is all less than mediocre. Last time I was there for brunch, my dad said, \"We should have gone to Ryan's.\" Ouch. They have a pretty big selection of desserts. It really grinds my gears that even though they have an omelet and waffle station, they can't make eggs to order because they only have a big bowl of premade egg mix on hand. So yeah, no fresh eggs on hand. They have scrambled eggs in the buffet line but... gross. Side note, try not to get seated by the omelet station. It gets boiling hot. Last time I was here, I actually dunked my cloth napkin in my water and dabbed my face and neck with it. I mentioned the heat to the hostess on the way out-- she asked how the meal was-- and her response was \"Oh, in the greenhouse? Yeah, hot day.\" No, not in the greenhouse. But that reminds me...My best friend had her bridal shower at Silvercreek about a year ago, in the greenhouse. In the middle of the meal, one of the chandeliers DROPPED FROM THE CEILING and shattered on the middle of a table. Unreal. The staff did not know how to handle the situation and the only compensation was free dessert. This place is such a mess.",

Since I try to eat vegan and I know it can be a pain to sort that out in a large party, I called ahead to ask if there were any vegan items on the menu.  The hostess was incredibly helpful, pointing me toward a couple of salads and a vegetarian entree that could easily be made vegan, and reassuring me that if nothing on the menu caught my eye, the chef would be more than happy to create something for me with the veggies and pasta they have available.Service at the restaurant was equally good.  I went with the autumn salad (Garden greens, apricots, pears, grapes, pecans, hazelnut vinaigrette) which was refreshing and delicious, and the stuffed poblano peppers (Black bean, corn & rice stuffing, red onion, cilantro, chihuahua cheese, paquillo pepper sauce) without the cheese.  The peppers were TO DIE for.  The pepper sauce was insane, creamy and delicious, yet somehow dairy free.  I still wish I had gotten that recipe!I'd definitely recommend Silvercreek for any vegans or non-vegans looking to get a high-quality meal!",

The restaurant has a warm & cozy feel to it - equipped with a full fireplace and lodge-esque interior.  The bread variety was quite delicious - esp. the olive and rye breads.  I ordered the jumbo shrimp appetizer (the name escapes me), which was incredibly spicy.  It was ok.  I also ordered the spinach salad, which was quite good.  My fiancee ordered the pot roast entree, which I sampled, and it was actually very good.  My friend ordered the brie appetizer, which was also quite tasty.  The only downside was the service, which was slightly lacking.  The price is moderate but nothing completely unreasonable.  They also have a nice selection of domestic and import beverages, which always makes me warm and fuzzy inside.",

I have never been disappointed.  Recently, I went to dinner there during Grad week.  It was very busy (as to be expected) and I had a large party of 9 people, we had a reservation but still had  to wait for our table, during our wait a girl came around with a cookie basket and the manager made several stops to ask us if we needed anything.  Once we got seated, our waitress, \"Diana\" (?) greeted us immediately and was very knowledgeable about the menu, she was very nice and personable.  A few of us sampled the specialty drinks on the menu which were delicious.  I had the Lobster Bisque soup - holy crap, unbelievable!  I mean, I could have licked the bowl.  Another gentleman in my party pretty much did!  For my entree I had the filet, the quality of meat and preparation was so nice.  The way the Chef placed the meat on top of the potatoes and asparagus was very upscale, not to mention easily the best steak I have ever had.  The potatoes & asparagus perfectly complimented the flavor of the filet.  For dessert I had the flour-less chocolate cake.  No cake should ever have flour, as this was the best dessert I have ever had...  In my life.  I would HIGHLY recommend this restaurant, the price is reasonable and for a casual upscale dining you can't get any better!  Go there now!",

The dish definitely was a bit better than your standard macaroni fare, but I don't think it's good enough to warrant an $18 price tag. The Sunday buffet is similar. It costs $20 and the food is a bit better than your standard buffet food, but not enough to warrant the much higher price.",

It was August and it felt like the A/C was broken in there, I had to use a menu as a fan. Service was slow and rude (we waited about 10 minutes just to get a beer menu, which we had to make a special request for). Music was terrible and so loud I couldn't tune it out (bad slow jams and classic 70s tunes). My so-called  \"Roasted red pepper risotto\" had not red pepper, but contained raw green pepper.

                "review": "We really wanted to like this place. I enjoy the farm-to-table, localvore style a lot. Our experience here was... less than optimal. I dined with my husband, and we had a late reservation. We had tickets to a performance at the Krannert, and wanted to eat dinner afterward. Silvercreek was one of the few places which had their kitchen open past 10, so we decided to check it out. We made a reservation, because we wanted them to know that we were coming. There were still two other tables dining when we got there, but that was it. I should have realized that something was wrong when I saw the totally empty parking lot at 10pm on a Saturday night.First problem: the place was really bright and the music was awful. Chain-restaurant bad 70s music and lighting. Not what I was expecting for the description of what they were going for or for their prices. Pros: the restored location is really charming, and with better lighting and a less cheap and intrusive soundtrack, the place could be beautiful.Second problem: the booth was dirty. The whole place was practically empty, they knew we were coming and they didn't bother to make sure that the table was clean?The menu is a nice one. We opted for the calamari to start, then my husband ordered the lamb and I ordered the duck. We like both medium rare, which is the standard way that both meats should be served.The food was just such a miss. The calamari was okay, and it would have been fine at Applebee's. For the price, a pile of frozen calamari rings (interspersed with pieces of fries and onion fritters - clean your fryer guys!) served with canned sauces is not the \"best of local, seasonal Illinois\". The entrees came out fast. I mean really fast. So fast that they were decidedly undercooked. I had already gotten a sense that even though the place was theoretically open for another hour, they were unhappy that we were there. Even though they knew we were coming. And they were open for another hour. Both the lamb and the duck were under rare. The cherry jam that was served accompanying my duck was refrigerator cold.We probably should have sent the food back, but it was obvious that the kitchen was hostile to the idea that people were bothering them an hour before they were even supposed to be closed, so I was somewhat afraid of what would happen if we did. Flat out: the kitchen shouldn't have sent out grossly undercooked food and the server shouldn't have brought the meat to our table that way. The message \"here's your food, eat and get the hell out so we can go home\" was not exactly subtle.The food would have been good if it had been cooked properly. The plate presentations were nice and the cherry jam was pretty good - nice warm spices and cherries cooked just soft enough. The jam would have been a great accompaniment to the duck, if it wasn't obviously straight out of the walk-in.It got worse, though. We had ordered a bottle of wine to share, and the entrees came out so fast that we were only half-way through. I'd noticed an \"artisinal cheese plate\" on the appetizer list. I figured that that would be something we could snack on while we finished our wine. Especially since the raw meat wasn't exactly a palatable meal. It also wasn't something that would take a whole lot of work from the kitchen, so I figured it would be safe. When she walked away from the table, the server yelled back to the kitchen \"Cheese plate coming\" Mel's diner-style. Seriously. The kitchen yelled something back to her about not knowing how to make one.The cheese plate was $19.00 for the large. What we got was a platter of cheese straight from the deli case at the local supermarket. Boursin, some sort of italian herb cheese, a really cheap Double Glouster, a brie and some bland white cheese. Not one of them were anything that would be close to artisan. Not one of them is \"the best of local, seasonal Illinois\". It was served with a handful of jarred black olives and a heaping scoop of the aforementioned ice-cold cherry jam. It wasn't an awful cheese plate, but it is not what it's advertised as, which is surprising since there are a fair number of artisan cheese producers in the area. For $19, I was expecting more than cold supermarket cheese.Soon after the cheese came the bill. No offer of desert, which is fine, since by that time we really wanted to get out of there and I could have stopped by the store on the way home and gotten some frozen pie if more stuff out of a box was where I wanted to go with the night.If you're looking for a nice meal, especially late, go elsewhere. The price they charge here does not match the atmosphere, service, quality or taste. It's more family dining, and it would have been great if the bill hadn't run to almost $200 (that's with wine, tax and tip). For slightly more money there are better places in town that don't make you feel like they hate you for coming in while they are open.",

The atmosphere was beautiful and intimate and the space was used well to include the head table, guest tables, the DJ, a bar, food tables and a projector reflecting a lovely slide show of the couple. The food was honestly the best i've ever had at a wedding reception and there was more than enough even with the guests piling enough food on their plates for a small nation! After dinner, the staff inconspicuously removed two tables to create a dance floor that stayed full the rest of the evening. The couple had a very tight budget for their wedding so I suspect the cost of the reception was well below what one would expect. It was truly lovely.",

I'm talking freshly ground beef that is not flattened like a pancake,but delicately formed into an uber thick loosly molded mound of juicy beefy goodness, housemade bun similar to brioche, and if you like your burger cooked to a specific doneness, ie medium, Medium rare,etc.. it will actually arrive at the table the way you had requested it.",

I don't eat pork, so this makes me very happy. There service is great too. We call ahead for seats and they are always happy to help. The manager came by our table and is always friendly. I love it here. We will be back of course! The 4 start is because they are a little pricey. It's $20.00 a person, with no drinks. Ouch. But in a way, they do give you a lot. Try to flourless chocolate cake. I promise you its amazing.",

That being said, I have had some hit or miss experiences with both the food and the service while I have been there. Most recently, I had dinner with my family there to celebrate my graduation for the University of Illinois. We had put in a reservation for our party well in advance and paid a substantial deposit. We showed up slightly early for the reservation and still had to wait almost an hour after the designated time. We were repeatedly told that it wouldn't be much longer, but by the time our party got to the table we were starving and pretty tired of being there. While I recognized that graduation is a very hectic time for people, I just did not understand what the point of making a reservation was when we had to wait as long as people who walked in the door. Once we were seated, the service was a little slow but was much more reasonable. Everyone enjoyed the food, which was flavorful and filling. Our favorite item was some sort of crab hushpuppies that were simply phenomenal. However, on other occasions, I have ordered fish dishes and found them to be somewhat bland. Overall, this place is a nice place to eat if you're looking for somewhere with a fancy vibe in Urbana. However, I would steer clear of it for important events (parents weekends, graduation, homecoming and other peak times) and check the menu before you go to ensure that the food suits your tastes.",

Definitely a stressful and extremely unpleasant dream.Graduation day at U of I. Reservations were made far in advance. We had a 9pm reservation with a $50 required deposit. When we walked in a few minutes before 9, we found ourselves shoulder to shoulder with angry and annoyed patrons. We spoke to several people who had been waiting to be seated 1, 2, and even 2 and a half hours AFTER their reservation time. They know how to take a reservation, just not how to keep the reservation. And that's really the most important part of the reservation.So, due to the $50 required credit card deposit, all those people were stuck waiting and waiting and waiting. After waiting an hour, we asked what would happen if we left, and they said they would charge us $50. I'm pretty sure this wouldn't hold up in a court of law, but the small claims filing fee is more than $50 so they have people hooked. When we were finally seated an hour and a half after our \"reservation\" time, the 5 of us were squished into a small booth with a chair at the end. There was no space for that chair. It was very uncomfortable. Were our drinks comped? Were we offered anything for our long wait? No. The server was very nice, but we were starved and exhausted and really annoyed. The food was great, but way overpriced. I had \"little parcels\" pasta filled with cheese. Really great. The taste was worth 5 stars. I find management's policy on the U of I graduation date coupled with their failure to keep reservations absolutely unacceptable. It is completely unnecessary, their restaurant would be packed skipped reservations or not. The management decided to take this opportunity to swindle people.",

The selection of breakfast/lunch foods was borderline overwhelming, but in a good way. Of course they have the classics - waffles, bacon, eggs, sausage - and then many more premium choices like prime rib, lox, and shrimp cocktail. There is also a fabulous dessert selection for those with more of a sweet tooth. The servers are quick to refill a drink or pick up an empty plate and were more than kind and tolerant of our group which was frequently moving around and staging photos in the middle of a booming time slot. I would absolutely come back!",

The restaurant's ambience is just about perfect, with romantic lighting and a beautiful garden room that's just breathtaking (more on that in a minute).There are some complaints on here about the food, but I think it's delicious.  I haven't had anything here I didn't like.  One of my favorites is a salad, whose name escapes me at the moment, made with field greens, goat cheese, toasted walnuts, dried cherries, and a champagne vinaigrette dressing.  It's simply divine; I could be happy with just that.  However, it just keeps getting better.  I think the chefs are pretty creative, although the menu hasn't changed much in the three years I've lived here.  The desserts are excellent, as is the wine selection.I've heard that brunch is fabulous, but we've only been for lunch once and dinner a handful of times.  They put on quite a show for New Year's Eve, with a special menu and a generally festive atmosphere.  It was New Year's Eve 2004 that my sweetie and I were sitting in that gorgeous garden room, enjoying a night out on the town, when all of a sudden, a diamond ring was staring me in the face, and my sweetie was down on one knee asking me to marry him.  Now, Silvercreek isn't directly responsible for one of the happiest nights of my life, but they certainly helped make it as perfect as it was, and for that, I thank them.",

Definitely not worth $20. Pretty good food but not $20 a person food and experience overall.",

The selection is smaller than what you would get at other buffets, but the quality of the food blows all the others away. I would say that it even rivals other non-buffet restaurants in terms of the quality of the food. I liked their prime ribs and croissants, they were very fresh, a new batch being brought out once every fifteen minutes. The ribs were flavorful and not under or overcooked in my opinion. Some people may find some of the slices of meat to be too undercooked, but there are plenty to choose from. One thing that was kind of disappointing is the selection of fruits. There was plenty of meats, vegetables, and baked goods to choose from, but I found the selection of fruits kind of lacking. Their website showed a whole platter of fruits with various melons berries, etc, but there was only a bucket of oranges and lemons (yes whole lemons) that you had to peel yourself. I would expect pictures to be slightly exaggerated, but this is a little too much. Even cheap buffets like Ichiban Chinese Buffet or Hometown will have slices of ready to eat fruit. Just that felt like a glaring hole, considering the price and the otherwise great food and service.The service is definitely above average and my water was refilled often, and the waiter was prompt at taking my used plates. I felt comfortable eating at Silvercreek, with the restaurant being clean and the friendly staff. Overall a really nice restaurant, but one star off for the lack of fruits and higher price.",

The space is still lovely.  I thought the food quite good until maybe the late 90's.  Several chefs have come and gone recently (last few years).  I have had lunch/dinner here a few times over the last, say, 6 months, and it has been decent.  Nothing too stellar, but not horrible.  The menu gets tweaked more frequently.  HOWEVER - today I stopped by for brunch at about 12:40, it is scheduled to go until 2:30.  Brunch at the Silvercreek of old was very good - lots of salad and hot items, bustling crowd.  It wasn't too crowded, but I was saddened at the brunch I saw.  VERY limited salad items (though the dressing was good).  Mostly very standard breakfast fare, except that the scrambled eggs were somewhat brown (not from brown eggs, either).  Very few hot items, either - some brisket, the kind you would put on a bun, fried chicken (boring), and some salty, rapidly cooling prime rib and ham.  Desserts were unmemorable as well, including a key lime pie that had so much green food coloring in it that I wondered if one of the ingredients was green food coloring.  The trifle I had and the cheesecake were lackluster.  To top it off, I saw my server three times - once for my inital drink, once to clear plates, and once for the bill (which was wrong, I was charged for 2 buffets!) .  Never asked how things were - breezy and unprofessional.  Come on Silvercreek, there are too many other good brunch choices in town, including Luna and Jim Gould (best brunch in town as far as I am concerned, though I don't think they do other meals well).  I think the owner is too busy with his car collection to oversee his eating establishments.  I have not been very impressed with the Courier lately, either (same owner).",

For as much as this place costs, I want it to be better. More innovative, more spectacular.

So will your vegetarian cousin and her picky five-year-old, and so will you.",

Sunday = 1/2 price wine night (per glass) which was surprising as their wine isn't unreasonably priced to begin with (~ $5-$9), and they have a nice selection to choose from.We split their goat cheese salad, I ordered their stuffed chicken breast, and my friend got their 5-spiced alaskan halibut (which I tried a bite of).  We both agreed that the chicken was really yummy and juicy, anwhile their halibut was well cooked and moist, I found it a bit tasteless (plus a on the more expensive for what you got).The ambiance is quite romantic (both inside and out), but you don't need to dress up unless you want (I was just in shorts, a tee, and a fleece), and it's just a nice place for a quiet dinner.I'm going between 3 and 4 stars here, but I until I try their brunch, I'll have to say 3.",

Everyone who took care of me was very attentive and knowledgeable.The bread that came with the meal was very tasty. I started off with the Roasted Squash Panzaella which is a crouton salad, and it was very good. There were too many croutons in it for me, but I just picked out some of them and ate the rest. For the entree, I got the Crispy Potato Crusted Michigan Whitefish. It was so good. I loved every bite. By the time I got to the end,  I was glad that I had not eaten all of the croutons in the appetizer.For dessert, I got the Apple Dumpling A La Mode and again it was amazing. It was on the small side, but I thought it was the perfect size for me. Someone else may be disappointed that it wasn't bigger but any bigger and I would not have been able to eat it all.All in all, I was very happy with my experience and if I am ever in town again, I will definitely go back.",

The service is good, although knowledge of the wine list could be better (from both servers so far). The menu is really interesting, with a lot of options, and some cool creative twists on some meals which would otherwise be your typical American bistro fare. Prices are worth it, HUGE portions (generally speaking-but the pork chop especially is Massive and the Hangar steak notsomuch).I fully intend on going back, frequently.",

It is quite an extravagant lunch with MANY options, and they were constantly refilling the trays so everything was fresh!  The waffles were fantastic, light and fluffy, the salads were fresh, and the hot items were flavorful.  I was struck, as a vegetarian, with how many green vegetable options I had!  Brussels sprouts, broccoli, zucchini with cherry tomatoes, spinach salad, cucumber salad!  For meat eaters, there were all sorts of coldcuts, fish and seafood, fried chicken, beef and ham.  And save room for dessert, there are almost as many dessert items available as there are main course, so many cakes!  Along with tarts, candy, apple crisp, bread pudding (which wasn't very good, the only thing I didn't like at all), trifle and fruit.  This is the perfect place to bring visiting family or have a nice brunch out with friends.  Service for us was good, though I did have a bit of a wait once for a water refill.  The only thing that was kind of surprising was the treatment of the line/where the buffet is set up, it's not ideal but it seems to work so-so.",

Based on the good reviews and seemingly more upscale menu, I thought this would be a nicer restaurant with good decor and great food. Well, not so much. My friend and I showed up around 7:30 on a Friday night and the place was only about half full. That should have been our first hint. The restaurant has a rather strange look what with the exposed brick and ceiling beams combined with the country-style tables, carpet, and booths. Overall, it just looked a little dated and old, especially the booths that were in a bit of disrepair. The dinner menu isn't huge and has a handful of selections for seafood, steaks, and pasta. I opted for the potato-crusted whitefish. It came with a cream sauce, asparagus, mushrooms, and carrots. It came out nicely presented, but when I lifted up the outer potato crust and got a glimpse of the actual fish I was so annoyed. I'm not exaggerating in the slightest when I say that piece of fish was 2x2 inches. Maybe you're not supposed to notice that with all the potato lumped on top of it, but at $18 that was absolutely ridiculous. My friend said her lobster mac and cheese was good, but so rich she could only eat half. And, BTW, it was corkscrew pasta, not macaroni.Sadly, I didn't order a salad because those actually looked pretty good. And there was also a good looking maple banana cake, but I refused to spend any more money there so I can't attest to the desserts. Overall, this place is way, way overpriced and I would never go back.",

I came in here on a moderately busy Sunday night and ordered a, 8\" parmesean chicken sandwich, expecting it to be any regular sandwich that I buy a campustown eatery, but, my goodness, this was probably the most awful sub I have ever eaten. After mind-numbingly slow service (from payment to sandwich was 15 minutes), a visually appetizing sub came out, with chicken, mushrooms, onions, topped with a layer of melted cheese. As I grab the sandwich, the middle just starts dripping everywhere, and by the third bite, the bottom just falls apart. The rest of the meal was just a struggle to get the greasy concoction back between the slices of bread. I guess the food tasted alright, but it just takes away from the experience when you have a mess of food dribbling all over your hands. I come here to get a sandwich for a reason because it's easy and quick to eat. The fries, too, were just terrible. I don't think I even tasted any potato inside of the fried exterior. They were hard, bland, and unappealing! Perhaps this was just an off-day for them. I've had better at other Penn Station locations.",

So of course they started to prepare them as a for here order.  Watching the girl prep our food we were concerned that she wasn't wearing any gloves while preparing the food.  My order of fries was only 3/4 of the way full.  When it's $5 for an order of fries I prefer to get my money's worth.  Food was good although 3 of our party didn't get what they ordered.",

I thought this might have been a mistake the first time, the second time I spoke to the manager and they said the recipe had been changed but I could ask to have it made the old way.  The third time I asked for it to be made the old way and I asked this of an employee that I recognized as having worked there long enough to know.  Again, it was completely bland and tasteless, the new way.  I wrote to the management and explained to them that I didn't like this new recipe and even when asked to make it the old way, I received it the new way.  I told them that I wanted to see some kind of concession made so that I could enjoy the sandwich the way I knew it (which really was a simple change, but probably meant a bit more expense per sandwich, adding up to a lot if done with everyone).  They didn't reply to me, no one offered a discount for another sandwich because I had spent full price three times on what I believed was a sub-standard sandwich.  So, I'm not going back.",

I'm always skeptical when places like this advertise \"East Coast\" anything, be it subs, pizza, whatever, as I am Brooklyn born and raised.  Their resemblence to any East Coast fare is usually pure hype.  I ordered the Italian sausage with onions and peppers and a small fries.  The sub was quite good.  Very tasty.  The fries were fresh and above fast food standards.  Offering little packets of malt vinegar for the fries was a nice touch.  Service was relatively quick and friendly.  I give it three stars rather than four because four stars says that I'm a fan.  Much as I enjoyed my first experience there, I'm not a fan, just a satisfied customer.  East Coast?  Well, the sub I had, though good,  was certainly not up to the standards of a Sausage HERO in Little Italy.",

My boyfriend's salmon burger was pretty good, but served on bread and not a bun, which was kind of odd.  I also had the English Orange iced tea, which was refreshing and a little sweet without being cloying.Our waitress had a major stick up her ass, though, which is why I'm downgrading them a star.  Bread Co., why must you hire rude people?  More often than not, the people working here are gruff and disdainful of the customers.  I get it, you're too cool to smile.  I'm not asking for a hug at the end of the meal, all I'm looking for is service without a scowl.",

I had read many reviews of the restaurant and entered with some trepidation.  My party had a reservation for ten people at 6:00pm and I was in the last group to arrive - a little late. The other guests were already enjoying a drink while waiting. The service and food were both outstanding. Our server, Nick, was prompt, polite, and knowledgeable.  Everyone's food looked so good. I ordered a vegan pasta dish with vegetables, which was excellent.  My wife had one of the unique pizzas and enjoyed it thoroughly. I noticed that at the end of dinner all in our party had left nothing on their plates.  We were all full happy campers! Only one member ordered dessert - chocolate mousse. He said it was great.We were finished with a leisurely dinner and had our bill paid with more than enough time to stroll down the block to see our play. The only negatives were bread that was a bit burnt due to what appeared to be a hot spot in the oven and the meals which were delivered to the table one or two at a time, which seemed a bit odd. However, the overall experience was enjoyed by everyone, making for an excellent prelude to the play. I will definitely come here again.",

They're usually a soup and sandwich place during lunch, but for dinner they completely switch up their menu: filet mignon, duck breast, tapas, and fondue???  On CAMPUS??

Fondue is really the only reason to check this place out since I don't know of anything else nearby that has this for dessert, but food is just average. Oh and their sangria is on point, too. But really, what college kid is drinking sangria? If they are, they are probably used to their wine out of a box",

There's a variety of sandwiches for the lunch hour, but I hit the Bread Company tonight, and my, do they swank it up for dinner.Dim lights, plentiful menu of pasta-pizza-sandwich options, and extensive specials list, including tapas.  Who knew?  I had the roast beef sandwich, served atop roasted potatoes and a light salad.

Even though we have had some issues with the service in the past, my family (pre-husband) has been coming here for as long as I can remember, probably over 10 years. The food is so good, there is really nothing the servers could do to keep us from coming back. My favorite meal in the world is the cheese fondue (sometimes with the tomato puree), one of the yummy pizzas (preferably with brie), followed by their chocolate fondue. (I think I have strayed from that formula once, I can't remember what I ordered)I didn't think it was possible, but last night, all three of those items were better than ever. We had the cheese fondue with the tomato puree this time, as well as the pesto, portobello mushrooms, artichoke hearts and brie pizza - it was amazing.The chocolate fondue came with more fruits than I remember in the past, red and green apples, pears, strawberries and some yummy little cake pieces. The best meal I had all year.The service was excellent.",

My husband and I usually share an order of cheese fondue and a gourmet pizza.  The Bread Company offers a nice selection of wine and beer, including wine by the carafe.  I can't forget to mention their selection of fresh baked cookies.  The sables and chocolate macaroons are delicious.  Great atmosphere, delicious food, and reasonable prices - I love this place!",

The Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, though, was aromatic and worth the extra charge (though it's reasonable to expect that the menu had listed the price or the waiter had known it after I asked: no luck on either).I waited much too long to place my order after sitting (and it was not busy).  But the prosciutto and gruyere omelet (which I added spinach to with no problem) that arrived vastly exceeded expectations: it was flavorful, chock full of good ingredients and not overcooked. The pan-fried potatoes were spiced but not overly salty (though I sent them back when they arrived with a huge dollop of unmentioned sour-cream--ew).The baked bread was sourdough and crusty and a perfect accompaniment. Nice job, Bread Company. Great food. Lacking final star only because my waiter could have used some some further training on the menu and service timing.",

Embarrassingly, I've heard some job candidates comment that they were taken here for 3 different meals during their visit!  My department is probably at fault for their lack of imagination when choosing restaurants, but The Bread Company offers some benefits that elevate it to a top pick for business-casual university diners:(1) Location.  For people who have short lunch periods and need to be within walking distance of campus, this restaurant's location is unbeatable.  (And since it's next door to an Espresso Royale, you can grab a coffee after your meal, if desired.)(2) Atmosphere.  Most college restaurants resemble a McDonald's Playroom for adolescents: neon walls and heavy-duty plastic furniture, with underlying scents of urine and vomit.  While The Bread Company does have a hint of grunge, it also invokes a strong sense of urban, artistic chic.  There are real paintings on the wall (not poster prints).  At night, they bring out white tablecloth and mood lighting.(3) Price.  I think the prices are reasonable depending on who you ask.  This place IS pricey when compared to most campus restaurants, where students are always trying to squeeze their dollars.  Lunch generally runs around $7 to $10, which is not unreasonable when entertaining guests.  (And still comparable/cheaper than what you can get at Timpone's, the other \"nice\" restaurant in the area.)All of the food is fairly conservative, with obvious combinations of flavors (brie + portobello, turkey + pesto, etc.).  I think this is also a reason that it ranks highly among options for guests; you will find nothing offensive here in terms of food (but also nothing exciting).  The presentation tends to be elegant and you can tell that most of the ingredients are of good quality.For lunch, I always go with the egg salad, which is creamy, well-seasoned, and always satiates my craving for egg goodness.  In the early evening, sometimes I stop by for a beer and appetizer with friends.  The cheese selection is quite good (you'll find Stilton, Gouda, Manchego, etc.), and the beers are all microbrews (if you're into that kind of thing).  Dinner selections include fondue, pastas, pizzas, and some specialties, but the prices are on par with more interesting restaurants in downtown Champaign/Urbana.In terms of baked goods, I am quite fond of ordering my sandwiches here with sourdough or rye bread.  Yum!  At most places with a baking reputation, I always find myself enticed by the sweet buns and cookies, but I almost never find myself tempted by the ones at The Bread Company.  Their treats always look colorless and hardened, as if they were made by an angry grandma.Overall, I'd recommend this to people who like simple, light food.  If you are cheap and don't care about indie street cred, you could probably get the same food at Panera.",

Horrible destination for dinner.The lines are long and the sandwiches are pretty decent at lunch time, and it's certainly worth a try if you've never been here before.I've been in twice for dinner and was very disappointed both times.  The first time I was here, the place was dead and there were maybe 2 other tables seated.  The other time was for Valentine's Day (stupid, I know), and the place was packed and seriously overbooked since they apparently had given reservations to everyone who called and asked for them.Both times, the service was very slow and the staff was *extremely* rude, to include elbowing and pushing customers during the crowded V-Day fiasco, which I found inexcusable.  The quality of the food was poor, the servings small, and the prices high.  There were definitely some interesting looking recipes on the menu, but the quality of the ingredients was very substandard so nothing tasted very good at all.  Produce is not fresh and all the fruits and vegetables I had on both occasions were over or under ripe and clearly prepackaged.  The first time I was in there, about 3 different entrees were ordered before we picked something they weren't out of.I only went back the second time for V-Day because I wanted to try out the chocolate fondue.  In addition to being waaaaaaaay overbooked, they were understaffed and had a limited V-Day menu that was basically just 6 or so items from the regular menu with the already high prices about doubled.  Portions were so unbelievably small that even after spending $75+ on dinner, we had to go to LaBamba's afterward because my husband was still really hungry.  Seriously, he was served a piece of lamb that was roughly the size of a sliver dollar and probably could've been eaten in one bite with a little effort.  Total time in restaurant was in the 3 hour range due to the poor service and inability to seat in accordance with reservations.  The chocolate fondue was served in a beat up saucepan that had something crusted all over the outside of it.  Chocolate itself was actually pretty good, but the amount of stuff they gave us to dip in it was staggeringly small and the vast majority of it consisted of bananas and apples that were overripe to the point they couldn't be eaten. Although it was fondue for two, there was only one piece each of the more high quality dipping items (cookie, strawberry, etc.)I will certianly not be back for dinner and probably not for lunch either since there are a variety of other lunch places in town that are just as good or better that are easier to get to, Paradiso in particular.",

I ordered the ham sandwich and my friend ordered their special salad of the day. Price was over $15. She got a diet coke, I was offered a shot glass of water with no ice. We get to the cashier and she refuses to listen to me as I try to tell her what our order was. I asked the gentleman who took our order to put it on one ticket as it was my turn to pay, and he didn't. So, she proceeds to ring me up, and then not give us the drink. So, I tell her, we need the diet coke. She flips back through the register tape and says, \"Oh, I overcharged you a little. Oh well. I'll go get the drink.\" NEVER offered me a refund or to make it correct. Then, gives me a picture to put on our table so she can bring us our items, but then said, \"Oh, nevermind, they are both ready.\" So, I'm standing there with a drink, my wallet and looking at two plates. I said, \"I can't carry all this.\" she says, \"You can take a tray\" and points to the cafeteria trays on the counter. I opted to deliver my friends salad to her (as she had secured us a table) and drink, and then came back for my sandwich. I ordered a ham sandwich. I got a turkey sandwich. And then, I got sick......I will NEVER return. I don't need to pay over fifteen dollars for a salad and drink and sandwich and be treated like shit only to then be sick all afternoon.",

If you think that the reason why they are selling out of different entrees at dinner is because of poor planning, it is obvious that you have never worked in the restaurant industry.  Dishes sell out at the Bread Company because they are popular...duh!  There is no way to predict what will sell what night, and if you are upset that dishes are out of stock, you should be showing up earlier to insure that they still have their full night's supply.  As for the service being poor, it's true: the servers are mostly college kids that could give two shakes about their job, but the food is so incredible, it just doesn't matter to me.  The head chef, Daniel is honest to God a pure genius when it comes to creating new dishes and I never order off of anything but the specials menu.  Trust me when I say trust Dan with your dinner.  If he has a hand in creating it it's bound to be amazing.",

It's such a shame because their food is not bad, but the service is so badly below standard, I decided I am simply never coming back here.There is one particular worker with tattoos on his arm who is very insolent towards customers, raising his voice at them for asking questions.For months, I've ordered a grilled sandwich to pick up for lunch time, and the result is totally random. If the owner (tall bald guy) is there when you call, chances are you'll get a good sandwich with the potatoes and salad on the side, but if he's not there, watch out: there's no telling what you'll get. Sometimes they include potatoes and salad with the sandwich, sometimes they don't. Sometimes they slice the sandwich, sometimes they don't. Sometimes the sandwich is available since the grill is on, and other times it's not even available since they turn off the grill in the middle of the day to save money randomly.Today for example, I went to pick up my grilled sandwich to-go, and was surprised to see that on this occasion there were no potatoes and salad included, even though two weeks ago I ordered around the same time and they were included. So I asked the short-haired lady in front of me behind the register, \"are there potatoes and salad?\" (pointing at the sandwich) and she stared directly at my eyes without answering! So I repeated the question and she stood there completely quiet, staring at me without answering, when the tattooed arm punk butted in our conversation, cocked his head at me and yelled, \"didn't we go over this already?!\" Don't bother coming here. Unless the owner fires some of the incompetent and insolent flunkies buzzing behind the counter soon, this place needs to go out of business ASAP.",

They have vegetarian options, that are okay, more diverse than many places, but the few times I've been there, the salads needed a little work.  It is a-ok to tear the lettuce up a bit so people don't have to slobber it all over their faces.  I really hate a clunky salad.  The pear panini was satisfying and but the IKEA tables outside make me nostalgic for my own yard and my own cooking, thus reinforcing my tagline \"Vegetarian with a touch of snobbery\"I don't rate restaurants on their administrative prowess, but if I did I wouldn't give any to the TBC.  The waitstaff and management made it nearly impossible to process a reimbursement through the University of Illinois.  You would think, given their proximity to campus, that they would train people adequately with respect to how to handle the idiosyncrasies of receipt processing through the University.  Instead, I am wasting my work and personal time chasing down the original receipt for a charge entered incorrectly by a waitress.  And the day manager can't help me?  Um... I just recommend not going here at all if there is a chance you will need to then make your lifework sleuthing receipts.  Oh how fulfilling.   I've heard other people say that it is always a nightmare to expense TBC meals.   The U of I-area restaurants need to take a page from the book of vendors in other college towns and get their act together.",

The house-made mint iced tea and mulled wine were also very good.The food was interesting and delicious, and our waitress Joanna was awesome.

My favorite is the cheese (gruyere) croissant because it is so flaky. It literally melts in my mouth. My coworker called it high class junk food but I call this good stuff. Sometimes, when I felt lazy to go to lunch, I would just buy a loaf of bread and eat that with a cup of coffee. The zufte or zoft, which is a Swiss specialty bread is amazing. It is fresh and out of the oven by 11am during school days. I have not seen other places in the area that sell zufte but the bread is really worth trying. Oh, if you have cravings for day old bread, they sell them at half price.They also have a wonderful selection for dinner. Daily specials change quite often but they have their regular dinner menu. I usually go with the daily special. This place also has fondue, both cheese and chocolate. I had both and I have to say that they are pretty stingy with their cheese and chocolate. I had barely enough to cover the fruit or bread. Do expect $12-$17 for entrees and about $10 for fondue. By the way, they sell cheeses too in the day.They have pretty good service but the people do not seem to smile a lot during the day, especially the owner. They should be happy because of the wonderful smell of fresh bread. The decor is a little European and has a fireplace at the corner which makes the place extra cozy in the evening. Anyhows, this place is highly recommended. I am sure you'll love it.",

Ten bucks without tip for this sub-MacDonald concoction. Overworked, insufficient in numbers student workers who do little in terms of service but hope for a tip nevertheless.

I wanted to get a small zupfe roll because they were fresh out of the oven and a cup of coffee, but that didn't cost $5 and I didn't have any cash (there is a $5 card minimum). I wound up getting an americano, a whole zupfe loaf, and a cookie. The zupfe was delicious. Hot from the oven, braided, yeasty, and slightly sweet. I pulled it apart and ate 1/3 of it right there. The cookie was pretty greasy. The americano was fine.The second time I came it was after a big exam and I wanted a glass of wine. At 11:30am. TBC was happy to oblige. My two friends ordered the portabella sandwich, which I had a bite of and I have to say it was delicious! Marinated chopped portabella mushrooms, melted cheese, some kind of sweet fruit spread. I wish I'd ordered it! I had a glass of riesling (which was fairly expensive for the quality) and a bowl of chicken noodle soup. I was hoping for a nice homemade soup with fat noodles and pieces of chicken, but what I got was a crock of bright yellow soup that I know came from a Mrs. Grass box. I will continue to come and try more of TBC's offerings, but definitely not the soups...",

They very much resemble the style we've had in Rome: very thin, crisp crust, light on the creative toppings. The portobello, artichoke, roasted peppers and fontina one was especially memorable.  Service was very good - prompt, friendly and quick.  Our waitresses were very pleasant.  The prices may seem a little high, so if you want a cheap thick crust gloppy stuffed pizza, go elsewhere.",

                "review": "Restaurant reviewAfter 1 year of living in Champaign, I finally had a chance to come to this restaurant recommended my a previous coworker. The reviews on Yelp are quite mix and it appears that lunch is good, but dinner is so so. Since I have not found another restaurant that has chocolate fondue here in Central IL, we decided to come here for dinner. I will say that I really wanted to like this restaurant, but overall value is a 2 star, the option for fondue brings it up to a 2.5. It is located right on campus and I never even knew about this restaurant when I lived nearby. The ambiance is very eclectic, lots of wall decorations and a European cafe feel. The multiple non-matching chairs throughout the dining room maybe a \"modern\" design, but I felt it was very \"chintzy\". I thought about going with the filet or fish entree, but the other reviews made me a little concern so I went with a safe dish (Shrimp fettuccine) with a light tomato basil cream sauce. It took a bit of time for the dish to come out. Meanwhile, we were given complimentary french bread. Given the name of the restaurant I was a bit disappointed that the bread was not a soft piping hot bread from the oven. Well I digress, back to the entree, it really wasn't anything special. My wife's quote on her salmon salad and the pasta was, \"It taste like food you can make at home\". The portions sizes were also smaller than expected when you order pasta at a restaurant. I was hoping that the chocolate fondue would be the redeeming value of the meal. Unfortunately this was not the case. Typically you would expect strawberries and maybe even a rice crispy treat to dip in the chocolate. Don't get me wrong the dark chocolate was amazing, but they gave a plate of pears, green and red apples, and some sort of cake that crumbled when you poked at it too hard with the fondue fork. Service is hit or miss, our server came by a few times and made sure our cups of water were filled. This maybe a great place for date night on campus or maybe for sandwiches at lunch, but my dinner experience was so so.Pros: Cheese and chocolate fondue, I have yet to find another place that has this option. Great for date night with wine, cheese, bread etc. Cons: Expensive based on what you get, small portion size, no hot fresh bread from the bread company for dinner, where are the strawberries, marshmallow, or rice krispy treats with the chocolate fondue? I think if they tried they could make this a stellar restaurant here in CU.Hidden deals: Daily drink and food specials on the chalk boardHealth code rating: A. http://champaign.il.gegov.com/champaign/estab.cfm?facilityID=2000",

Cool -- except that the whole thing turned out to be kind of a disaster. We all ordered at the same time, and there seemed to be plenty of servers for a full room at dinner, but our meals arrived over the course of a half-hour (the pasta came after the steak, hmm). Fresh and tasty dinners, yes, but it was impossible to wait and eat together, and everyone was antsy due to the delays. In the end, we finished 20 minutes after our preferred time and our waitress did not seem particularly motivated to help the situation along or even really apologize.So: Good food, decent wine, but the service is a gamble. Try it, but go on a quiet weeknight -- definitely not for a Krannert opening or right before another occasion.",

Sandwiches are on luscious slices of thick bread and the soups come with crunchy salads. I especially like the grilled sandwiches, which are laced with creamy butter and lightly browned meat. Portions are quite large and one sandwich could probably be shared easily among two adults. Sometimes I forget this and end up making two meals out of one sandwich.During lunch hours this place is quite crowded, but by late afternoon it becomes serene. Soft green light floods in from the skylight and during the winter you can sit the fire with a baguette and a glass of wine.  As regards to the review that mentioned rudeness about adding protein to things, I've heard that happen many times during lunch and now they let you have your meat, but charge a lot for it. They have this bizarre policy because they \"don't want people making their own sandwiches with the bread that comes with the entree.\" Nice one. At night it becomes more formal, with candlelight, fondue, and more upscale entrees. The balsamic potatoes that come with the entrees are perfect. I like the fondue, but it's a little too much for me...even the small pot can be shared by two. Last time I was there I tried the tapas and the yellowfin tuna and the lamb were delicious, but I was less than enthusiastic about the duck mousse, which had a bland sickly sweet flavor. The greens that came with the tapas were also pretty inexcusable. When I go to a good restaurant I expect more than just some shredded romaine, especially when field greens are still in season. The new small desserts are also not so great. The chocolate mousse was good, but the bread pudding was just some bread soaked in eggs and sugar.",

I always hear mixed reviews about this place from my friends, but I'm going to go ahead and give it a 4.  This is my new favorite lunch place on campus (for when you have time).  The sandwiches may be $1-2 more but are killer compared to other on-campus options.  The grilled sandwiches may be a little buttery on the crust for some, but it's perfect for me.  Last time that I went I got the grilled turkey sandwich which comes with caramelized onions and cheese.Dinner options include fondue and pretty good pizza.  They also have some good bottles of wine on the list, I've ordered a bottle twice and been happy with what I got.  You might have to talk to one of the chefs if you want wine opinions since our server didn't seem to know much.Really good atmosphere and decor, it's casual/fancy enough for pretty much anything, and it's right next to Krannert if you need an after-show dinner.",

                "review": "My husband and I, along with two other couples, decided to celebrate the end of the semester tonight by going out.  After *much* debate, we ended up at The Bread Company.  As a former music major, this was one of my usual haunts, but the rest of them hadn' t been there quite as frequently.  (Lunch, by the way, is excellent; they have excellent sandwiches and salads).The specialty, of course, is the fondue, which is magnifique.  My only gripe is that portion sizes tend to vary widely from time to time, as does the selection of vegetables that comes with your meal.  The combination of cheeses, though, is great, and the bread and potatoes are wonderful.Tonight, though, I had one of their specials, which was good, but was actually my *third* choice of menu items.  They were out of the fettucine with salmon AND out of the chicken pizza.  Now, I don't pretend to understand the inner workings of the restaurant business, but it really irritates me when they run out of something.  To me, that just smacks of poor planning.  Do they not have a kitchen?  Can they not make more?  If not, then can they not provide accurate estimates of how much of each food item to make, so they won't run out?  I don't know, but it just seems like when you go someplace, you should be able to look at the menu with confidence.Anyway, the beef fondue I had was very good, and one of my dinner companions adored her trout.  She said it was the most moist fish she had eaten in quite some time, and she is a fish lover.  Her husband, a reasonably picky eater, devoured his pancetta pizza with no complaints, as did another friend with his salmon.  I thought the portion sizes of some of the meals were pretty small, especially given the price.  Still, it's good food, and worth the money, especially when you consider it's not that expensive.  Service was pretty good, although a little slow, particularly since they weren't that busy tonight.  My guess is she just had a hard day.We love the Bread Company and will continue to visit, but probably just for the fondue.  We know they'll have it, and we know it's good.  Thanks for a fun evening!",

                "review": "Our family dined here after my sister's graduation. It was nice of them to move our reservation up on such short notice but after eating here, I understood why this wasn't a problem.If you're called \"The Bread Company\" you probably shouldn't serve burnt bread. The crust of our Italian bread was burnt. Though the bread was good otherwise, leaving a charred taste in your patrons' mouths is not the best way to start a meal.When my sister made the reservation they did not inform her that there wouldn't be a full menu that day. So though we looked at the menu online beforehand, we were only able to order from their limited graduation-day menu.There were seven of us and we ordered vegetarian dishes. Three of us had the grilled portobello sandwich with raspberry aioli and brie ($10), which was served with a side of salad greens and roasted potatoes. The presentation and portion-size were perfect. The mushrooms were fresh and juicy and the raspberry aioli went well with the brie. Those who ordered this plate seemed satsified.The other four of us split two pizzas: the roasted garlic with san marzano tomato sauce and Parmesan ($12), and the pesto with portabella, artichoke hearts and brie ($15). The reason we split them? Our waitress said they were 10 inch pizzas. They were actually smaller, about 6-7 inches in diameter. Now I usually love a cracker-thin crust, but ours was burnt in places. The roasted garlic pizza was at best a decent cheese pizza and the pesto with portabella and artichoke hearts did not benefit from the addition of brie; though it added texture, the brie did little to compliment the flavors of the other ingredients on the pizza. Overall the ingredients seemed fresh, but I've had much better thin crust pizza for less money, and more of it too. Though the restaurant seemed full, the same people were dining the whole time we were there. Only one party arrived while we were dining. It's a small place and there only seemed to be a server or two but seeing as it wasn't really busy, you'd think service would be more attentive. Our waitress was not. She was pleasant. She refilled our waters once and brought another basket of (still burnt) bread upon request. We were not asked if we wanted drinks or dessert. And we waited for our check for about twenty minutes. Turns out she went on lunch and took our check with her. We didn't gyp her on the tip at all--seeing as it's a college-town and they were probably short-staffed on graduation weekend, and we weren't running late for anything--but we certainly won't be dining here again. Side note: they do not accept Discover.Taking everything into consideration, I'd give this place a C+. I'm sure there are better white-cloth restaurants in Champaign-Urbana and you'd be better off eating there.",

I am less into fondue (exceot for chocolate dessert fondue), but this is the place to go for that.  The ambiance is eclectic and European.  Families will feel welcome.  Service can be a little ragged, sometimes a student group of 15 or large party will materialize, and that can have a rather deleterious effect on service when there are only 2 servers on the floor, which is often the case at night.

The only reason I continue to go back has got to be because I forget about how sub-standard their food is. And today I decided to finally put my disappointment on the internet.This review was spurred by a visit today to get coffee and a pastry. I ordered an americano that was obviously made with poor quality espresso, and perhaps by someone with little knowledge of what an americano should be. It was too watery, but maybe that is my taste. I also had what they dared to call a chocolate croissant. It could have been made days ago. Instead of being light and fluffy, it was dense and doughy and filled with chocolate chips that were never fully melted so they maintained their chip structure. I was less than impressed. But this seems to be the way things go at the Bread Company.As I mentioned earlier, I have been going to the Bread Company for quite a few years (having been at the U of I as a student since 2008), and their menu has yet to change. At all. This sort of stagnancy is worrisome and really speaks to the lack of effort that the chef and/or owner put into this business.On a recent dinner visit I got the chocolate fondue which came with possibly pre-made cinnamon bread slices, strawberries, and a plethora of apples and pears. I suppose the apples and pears were in season (it was November when I went), but I don't see how apples work with chocolate. I've had their pizza many times, and I cannot deny that they do a good crust...but I just don't get the pizza that comes with a mountain of salad on top. It is just too much and overwhelms the pizza that really should be the star of the dish.Overall the Bread Company is uninspired and very tired. This is reflected in their dusty, unchanging interior, their menus, and the often impolite, lackluster performances of the staff.",

Just about anything else I've had there, including their soups, was just bland and cost waaaaay more than it should.

At the time you could get a very decent swiss cheese fondue with good bread, some roasted garlic for an appetizer, and two glasses of house red for just over $30--a princely sum for a starving college student, but compared with the trendy $100 fondue restaurants in the SF Bay Area, a steal. The dinnertime atmosphere was also great: quiet, romantic, dimly but warmly lit.They also had fantastic checkerboard shortbread cookies. I've been hard pressed to find better anywhere else.Lunch sandwiches and other baked goods were both decent, but the five stars are for the fondue date memories.",

It was, by far, the worst restaurant service I have ever experienced. It was a shame because the restaurant has such great potential because the food was great...but the service was so bad that I never want to come ever again. The waitress I had was unfriendly. It was really weird -- it didn't even seem like she was attempting to be nice. Also, I spent 2x the amount of time I should have been there waiting for my bill and for the waitress to take my order. Basically, if you have a lot of time on your hands and you don't mind awful service, this is a great place to get food. However, if you have any standards for customer service, don't bother.",

I really wish I could discuss the food, but the service is so bad that I can't remember what I had to eat.  In case the staff reads yelp in between listening to the Smiths all day and wondering why they aren't famous artists yet, here are some tips:1.  Bring menus for everyone2.  Do not walk away if only three people have ordered and there are four people at the table.3. Do not roll your eyes, kid. 4. Do not pretend that you are a really good waitress who can remember everything.  You have to write it down because when you don't write it down you will end up bringing me the wrong thing.  5.  Do not forget to take empty plates off the rickety, unclean table because otherwise there is nowhere to put down the food. It's ok the first time you bring it because the order is wrong and you have to take it back.  (See number 3) 6.  Do not let our wine glasses get empty. We live in the midwest too. We hate it here too. We need more wine.",

First of all, the atmosphere is incredible. I've spent a lot of my life in Europe, and the way this place looks reminds me of little mom-and-pap restaurants one would find in the Mediterranean. This feeling is especially strong in the terrace in the back; stepping into that room feels like stepping into Spain. It's a bizarre, nostalgic experience for me, and one that hasn't happened quite as strongly anywhere else in the United States. The lunch is incredible. I like to think of myself as a bit of a sandwich connoisseur (hold your laughter), and the grilled sandwiches here are amazing. The dinner, unfortunately, isn't up to par with their lunch service. The only dish fresh enough in my memory to comment on is the shrimp linguine, which was a little bland. I haven't been able to try the fondue yet, which seems to be the go-to dish here, so I'll be trying that next time I go.Service is lovely, and their handmade drinks are very good too. Strongly recommended.",

They sure knew how to accommodate a large group of 14 year old girls on my birthday years ago!Recommendations-Roast beef sandwich-Portabella, brie, and raspberry jam sandwich-Zpfe bread, it's comparable to challah bread.-Cheese fondue - beautiful beautiful gruyere fondue. As good as Switzerland-Meat fondue - the broth is lovely, it's served with three different sauces and fresh baguette.-Chocolate fondue - Melted swiss chocolate, fresh fruit in season, cookies, pound cake.I love this place.

Sometimes I went for the half soup/half sandwich, or half salad/half sandwich to get more variety in my diet. The food here is like comfort food for me, since I grew up in Urbana and my mother used to buy these sandwiches and their large loaves of freshly baked Zpfe for my brothers and me. The service at The Bread Company has always been fast and efficient, and the employees were always very cool and made no mistakes taking my order and making me a really good sandwich. I've been here a few times for dinner with my friends. The atmosphere totally changes in the evening for dinner, as they lay out white tablecloths, dim the lights and allow the romantic glow of candles set the mood. Their pizza is delicious and filling, and their tapas come in pretty big portions. This is a cute and cozy place for anyone on a date or double date, or out to celebrate a special occasion.I've ordered take out from them a few times when I've had last minute dinner party pot lucks to attend and didn't have time to cook. One time, I picked up a strawberry walnut mixed green salad, which was perfect, and also a french baguette with a side of baked garlic bulbs drizzled with olive oil. It was worth every dollar.I love this place!",

Now, I wasn't a huge fan of ham, and I truly hated swiss, and about all he knew was that I liked mustard (so he included it), but... being that we were so new together, I ate that sandwich like it was a long lost favorite.And shocking... instead of having to choke it down... I loved the thing!  Later in life, when I explained to him how much I hated ham and swiss sandwiches, I told him how amazed I was at how much I loved the one he'd been getting me from The Bread Company!!  Their ingredients, I mean!  Talk about fresh (I hate to sound like a commercial, but!  When it's true, it's true!!) The sprouts were genius, and the swiss was like none I'd ever had.  Ever!  Emmentaler. I mean, this place was no joke SMART about how it crafted food!  And there was no denying that rye!  The crown jewel of the whole thing!  Crunchy exterior, soft in all the right places, with a kick-yer-butt mustard... just out of this world spectacular.The whole thing became our ritual.  I'd come into town from Bloomy and we'd head over to Bread Company.  He'd get a loaf, hot out of the oven, of Challa, and I'd get my ham and cheese sandwich and we'd head back to his dorm.  Such bitter sweet memories.  And all over a sandwich!Trust me, this place makes some of the best fresh bread (I mean... HOT FROM THE OVEN GOOD), and some of the greatest food on campus.  They do more than sandwiches... OMG, go one night for the fondu!  It's an amazing experience!!  Whatever it is, find something you love and make it a memory to share.",

                "review": "Bacaro is a restaurant that I would reserve for a special occasion....or just to treat yourself to something a little different.  My favorite is the Market Monday prix fixe menu with ingredients selected from the saturday farmers market.  to go from fresh local ingredients on saturday morning to a full 5 course meal and wine pairings by monday night is pretty spectacular.  The last couple market night meals that i have been to have been around 40 dollars, and for an additional 25, you can get some awesome wines (highly recommended). The courses are so elegantly prepared with amazing presentation and you won't go home hungry.  I've noticed the dishes are a little too salty for my taste... actually, they're consistently salty to me (but then again this is coming from someone who barely ever salts their food) but i think you can get around it by indulging less in the amazing sauces.  and the desserts-- so delicious.  the desserts truly capture the seasons and the feel of the weather so perfectly.  I honestly don't know a better way to start the week!  if you have a bad case of the mondays, treat yourself to some bacaro.  and your spirits will be lifted. I have gone several times and enjoyed several of the menu items, and a few market nights (i hear they're introducing an occasional VEGETARIAN!!!! market menu!!) and i have never been disappointed.  The service is great, and they are very attentive.  Some servers are more knowledgeable about the wines and others know a little more about the food and preparation, but overall, they are a pleasant and fun to talk to group.  If you ask them a question and they don't know the answer, they are probably equally curious to know the answer as well-- meaning they will find you an answer even if it means hounding the chef :-) I think you definitely get what you pay for.  and for a city like champaign, bacaro is definitely a lovely gem.",

Great atmosphere, dimly lit, very nice.Service: 5 stars... we found the service to be extremely high caliber without being snooty.  We ate at NOMI in Chicago a few weeks ago and the service was comparable.  Quality and Kind... just the kind of service we adore.Food: PERFECT.  I'm not a \"foody\" but I adore good food.  The octopus was the best I've ever had.  The gnocchi was incredibly savory.  My husband tried the steak and I had the lamb special.  Both were FANTASTIC.  Wine suggestion: 4.5 Stars.  Wine was good, not great.  I'm not sure if we failed to describe what we wanted.  Would be nice to have some descriptions in the wine menu.  We've been to several nice restaurants in Chicago that provided descriptions of at least a subset of wine choices.  This is such a minor point though.We did not eat dessert as we were stuffed.I can't say enough good things about this very very special restaurant.  I'm just disappointed we took so long to finally get around to eating there.  We will be back... this is now my favorite restaurant in Champaign Urbana!!",

The Pinot Noir was delightful and the Cab Sauv was decent as well.With wine, we had a cheese plate with 5 cheeses and plenty of bread.For dinner, the risotto with rabbit was tasty.Dessert was a red velvet ice cream cake.  It was okay.  Bacaro used to have a panna cotta that was memorable to the point where, it was the one item I truly wanted to have again when returning to this spot.  Oh well, maybe next time.Overall, a great spot for good food and drink.",

I also felt that I was missing a spoon to easier roll the spaghetti in, and I don't really see the point of being given a knife instead.  Finally the Malbec I ordered (by the glass) simply shouldn't be on the menu in a fine dining restaurant.To complete my negative experience, everything on the menu was 2 to 4 dollars more expensive than the already high prices posted on their \"sample menu\" online.   To be fair, the service was fine (although not extraordinary) but obviously couldn't compensate for the rest.",

Not enough to send it back but one more grain of salt and I would have refused to eat it.  My companion suffered the same fate.  The wine list was either very expensive, they did not have it or Slovenian, not sure what's up with that.  We ended up drinking beer because we could not find anything we liked.  I'd give the place one more try just to see if perhaps this was an off night.To the other raves comparing this place to the top restaurants in NY or Chicago I would say \"oh please\"!

Wine came out about 10 min after our food on a few courses which left us unable to experience the \"pairing\" as you should. We politely and discreetly asked her to bring wine out with or right before food and I think that ticked her off. After that, she was aloof, barely explained the wine or the dishes we were being served. Water was slow to be refilled. The real kicker was the 20% automatic gratuity she added after tax on our bill! When we asked to speak to the manager, she told us \" he's busy dining with a client\". Say what??? I believe your customers are your priority! We asked a different waiter to see if he could find the manager and low and behold, out he came!  Tainted our experience and maybe our waitress was just having a bad day but when you are dropping that kind of money on dinner- you had better train your wait staff on how to properly serve and deal with customers.  It was a shame because from the chef end- he did a great job of making delicious and interesting food- it's just too bad no one explained it well or delivered it professionally.Just wanted to post an update. We received a very kind letter from owner/ manager apologizing for our experience and gave us a generous gift certificate to try them again.  We definitely will give them another chance. Again- the food is amazing and we want to see them succeed.",

I've been to Italy, and this ISN'T Italian...I suppose the entire visit was lackluster. The decor had a lot to be desired, but the wait staff were great. However, once we ordered wine (and, by the old menu at least, were supposed to receive the standard 4oz glass) things went downhill. While we were savoring the tiny portion in our glasses, the bartender was doing his best to overfill the glasses of the pretty girls at the bar. When questioned, we were told \"they asked for doubles.\" Who orders a double Merlot? We chose what appeared to be a special at the time: a smoked duck panini. What arrived at the table was a glorified ham and cheese sandwich. No, I'm not complaining about the sandwich itself, but they had substituted ham instead of smoked duck, then claimed that I wouldn't know the difference. I'm not sure if it was just this visit or the one that followed that biased me, but I'll never return.",

The servers and bartenders were knowledgeable and attentive.  We were there on a Monday so we were able to enjoy the Market Monday tasting menu, and I have to say, each dish was delicious.  Each dish was seasonal and had a great blend of flavors; I couldn't pick a dish that I didn't like.  We opted for the wine pairing and each wine matched the dish it was served with very well.  Wine has been a hobby of mine for a number of years but my wife is just getting into it, and she was blown away by the taste difference the pairings made.  I think the reviews stating that this restaurant was 'snooty' or that the service was slow are from people who don't truly understand what this restaurant is.  We spent 2 hours eating our 5 course meal.  It's a place where dining is an experience.  Come here expecting that, and come hungry.  Any complaints about small portion sizes must be coming from people ordering a la carte.  We'll be back the next time we want to have a fancy date night, without question.",

If you put the restaurant together as a whole package including the ambiance, the uniqueness of the food, and culinary innovation you would get a 3 star restaurant, however the flip side is that the culinary flavors do not resemble anything like the gastronomic experience you get when you dine at Next in Chicago or Charlie Trotters when it was still open. You pay quite a premium for the dish that are notably small. Our dinner meeting was held at this location. There is plenty of meter parking, just remember to not go over or you will likely be ticketed. I started my meal with the wagyu beef stew which had smoked potato and a bone marrow crostini. I can honestly say the crostini was amazing with bone marrow that offered an amazing umami flavoring, however the actual stew was salty, the beef was not tender by any means sort of tasting like a dinty moore stew. This cost 13 dollars and the portion size was very small. My main entree for 33 dollars was the grilled lobster tail with kale, crispy black truffle polenta, and additional lobster claw and pieces of lobster on the side with a acidic lemon tasting sauce. Once again the portion size was quite small as you see from my picture. I don't believe you get the whole lobster tail as it looked like 1/2 of a lobster tail. There was a piece of claw meat on the side and the other side was shredded lobster meat. The lobster was cooked well, tender and well flavored with the black truffle polenta balancing the seafood, however the attempt at the different texture from the arugula/kale along with the soft polenta and the lobster did not work. Our meal ended with a flourless chocolate cake with blood orange champagne foam and pomegranate jelly. The grapefruit foam hit the spot, but again the cake was a sliver and for that cost you would think the portion would be bigger. Due to the long wait for the waiter to bring the dessert menu, I ended up getting my first parking ticket in Champaign. So I agree the flavors and small portion size at this price do not make this a place that I will frequent. As another yelper said, if you want to impress your date this maybe an interesting place to try, however I am going to try to find another culinary gem elsewhere.Pros: local sustained food, changing menuCons: VERY expensive, small portion size- I left hungry, taste and texture just does not work for some dishesHidden deals:If you really want to impress your date, try the 7 course tasting menu at 85 dollars. I don' t know if that is a deal but at least you get to try everything for $$$",

Yes, despite the fact that there is a lot of mediocre food in the area, it's not the area's fault. Champaign-Urbana has fantastic terroir. There are many producers nearby making food that is world-class and Bacaro uses these ingredients to great effect. I LOVED the goat cheese salad and my rich creamy risotto. Fried sweetbreads were luscious. My boyfriend's chicken with chicken liver was delicious. I guess the only complaint is that the prices here are the same as in NYC...",

The servers are among the most professional in the C-U area. The food is genuinely sophisticated. However Bacaro's commitment to local, seasonal ingredients, while being one of its strengths, is also one of its greatest weaknesses. The menu at Bacaro is constantly changing based on what ingredients they stock. This tends to result in inconsistent dishes whose preparations are constantly changing. Of three visits I've eaten some bad, ok and great meals.Visit 1:Had halibut with some kind of crust in a mint-gazpacho. The fish was fresh and of excellent quality. This was frustrating however because the fish was coated in a greasy crust that became soggy from the fish sitting in the mint gazpacho. The gazpacho was also greasy and was not pleasantly minty. What could have been a complex, herbaceous broth, wound up tasting like greasy mouthwash. Fantastic ingredients but badly executed prep.Visit 2:Valentine's Day prix-fixe. Three courses all of which were delicious. The appetizer was some kind mediterranean type salad if I recall with olives and I think preserved lemon. Delicious and fresh! My main was halibut again, with some kind of vanilla saffron sauce. The fish was perfectly cooked and the sauce was complex and homey. My girlfriend got the steak and it was of great quality with a strong preparation to match. The dessert was a chocolate torte with blood orange sorbet- good flavors that were well-executed.Visit 3:Pork loin with mustard spaetzle. The spaetzle were delicious! I could eat that spaetzle every day. The pork however was DRY. Really, really dry. I was trying to conserve the mustard sauce on the plate in order to make sure there was enough to get on each slice of pork. It was that dry. So in closing out of three, expensive visits, the food has been good maybe 1.5 times- with me being able to say I enjoyed one complete meal (valentine's day) and the side of one of my mains (the spaetzle). If the food was consistent, Bacaro would be an easy 5-stars. Hopefully they can strike a balance moving forward between rotating fresh, seasonal ingredients and maintaining a consistently-executed menu.",

Well, Bacaro certainly deserves it: I finally went there for dinner last night (after wanting to go for several months), and I was wowed. I'm still salivating thinking about it.I went there with pretty high expectations (I'd heard great things about it from several friends and coworkers): that's usually not a good thing as it makes it easier to be disappointed, but Bacaro did not disappoint. In fact, I'm happy to say that my dinner there was on a par with my best dining experiences in NYC.First and foremost: the food. My boyfriend and I decided to share a bunch of dishes. For appetizers, we ordered the fresh mozzarella with heirloom tomatoes and pesto, as well as the roasted suckling pig with homemade sauerkraut: they were both absolutely delicious (don't miss the suckling pig!). We then shared one entree: we got the braised pork shank, which came with sauteed spinach, mushrooms, bacon, and fig sauce: soooo good! The portions are not huge, but two appetizers and one entree turned out to be enough food. For dessert, we got the panna cotta with fresh fruit: simple but just as outstanding. That was some seriously great food!!As Bacaro is also a wine lounge, their wine selection is quite extensive. We got a sampler of three wines by the glass for $14, all of which were pretty good. Not to forget the 10yo port we got with our dessert (very generous pour...), which was good also.Service was great, ambiance was great (although it's a shame that the place was so empty)... it was really a great dinner (sure, it was not cheap, but entirely worth it!). By far the restaurant in Champaign, in my opinion. I'll definitely be back.",

Second, my gnocchi tasted like it came out of a Bertolli bag in the frozen section at a supermarket and the sauce was inundated with salt. After trying some parmesan, which was freshly grated (about the only positive), and pepper flakes, I realized that nothing could save the dish. If you want to pay Chicago prices to impress a date, you can try Bocaro, but don't expect more than oversalted Champaign food.",

On our most recent visit, we ordered a few things from the new menu, all of which seemed fantastic--it was hard to choose. We had greens, octopus salad, gnocchi, and the scallop entree. Each course was just as delicious as the last. The scallop entree is so clever and very well executed--it's such a treat to have perfectly cooked, high quality seafood in the middle of Illinois. Chef Drew worked his magic with this dish. There are \"scallop potatoes\" on the plate, which blend in and look just like the actual scallop next to it. Biting into the potato is an experience, especially if you're expecting a scallop! They are divine. I could eat a whole plate of just the potatoes, I swear.We were too full to order dessert, but everything I've had in the past from the dessert menu has been phenomenal--creative, elegant and fun at the same time. Their pastry chef Lindsey is awesome! As for wine, I didn't have anything beyond Prosecco on my last visit, but I usually just allow the staff to select something for me. It's always on the money.The service is always impeccable as well--smooth, engaging when it needs to be and with a huge attention to detail. Connor took care of us on our most recent visit. He's a truce service professional--knowledgable, eager to offer suggestions and advice with the menu, but allows the experience to flow naturally. We had such a nice time with him! Plus, Julie is always there to make sure everyone is having a perfect experience.I highly recommend bacaro to anyone who is visiting CU who is looking for a polished, smooth, fine-dining experience. I would also steer visitors that way if they are just looking for a place to relax with a glass of wine. And for those of you who live in this community and have yet to try bacaro, I would say do yourself a favor and go! Treat yourself!",

We chose to do the tasting menu which was about 6 courses, complete with a cheese course and dessert.  I paired it with the wines too. The wine list was definitely impressive.  Lots of interesting wines at very fair prices. They are considered a wine bar, so I was hoping for a good list.  But I was impressed with the prices, there were many bottles on the list for under $30 which is always great to me.  It's easy to fill a list with great expensive bottles, but it is indeed very difficult to pick a variety of great wines at reasonable prices. The wines paired perfectly with each dish, I was so happy.  About the food... I was just so impressed.  The octopus over german potato salad was unlike anything I've ever had, and just so delicious.  Yes, it does sound strange but it was so well done, and the octopus was cooked just perfectly, it was so tender.  I was so thrilled the chef has decided to include this as one of the courses.  We had a big scallop seared and served over corn salsa which was almost sweet but just delicious.  We also had braised rabbit, which again was tender and also quite flavorful sitting in a pool of broth, with some tomatoes, and homemade pasta.  The rib eye for the main course was flavorful and again very tender.  The cheese course was fun.  And I loved thin very rich slice of chocolate dessert.  To be honest, I was simply amazed at the quality of these dishes.  Sure it is a more expensive dinner out, but for the quality and caliber of the dishes, it is a steal!! This is easily one of my most memorable and favorite dining experiences.  Easily 5 stars for Bacaro!!",

Really kudos there. Portions are small - you probably would expect that in this sort of establishment. We opted for a la carte options.  I don't mind paying top dollar for great food, but the total for two people prix fixe with wine substitution is $240 before tip.  Now again, I don't mind paying, but there are michelin starred restaurants in fabulous cities that are not -this- expensive.  This is Champaign, a small but charming place in central Illinois.  Wife and I had a bottle of wine, two pasta entrees, and two desserts to the tune of about $110 after a nice tip (20-25%) - You can eat reasonably here if you avoid the prix fixe menu. The food was great.  Everything was jam packed with flavor, perfectly cooked, and elegantly presented. Would definitely return for another 'date night' or special occasion.  Definitely not a place to go for dinner if you're looking for grub, though.",

There was presentation to the entire experience, which is something I've found a little lacking since moving to Champaign.I wouldn't want to eat in the bar area on a Saturday night, and if the hostess hadn't been able to move us into the other room we would have had to leave.  My dad can't hear very well and his hearing is better than my lip reading.  The bar area is really nice and I'd love to eat there on a Tuesday, which I have.The good:  The food.  Three people, three different dishes, and everybody liked theirs.  I had the halibut and mom had the rabbit, and if you're going in there soon, I'd recommend either, and even more I'd recommend the vichyssoise with crab and asparagus.  If you're hardline vegetarian (I eat fish) then you'll have problems with the menu, but I believe the waitress at least implied that the chef would make allowances/prepare something else?  Either way you should call ahead and see.  I have no complaints about oversalting like other reviewers, perhaps they listened?  The malbec we drank with dinner was a nice random choice.The bad:  Our waitress was new.  At least I hope she was new.  The service was great but she wasn't as familiar with the menu or wine list as someone working at that caliber of restaurant should be.The manhattans were terrible.  I suspect Bacaro of being yet another restaurant who thinks they should have their own special manhattan, with exotic bitters and cherry juice and... do you think you're going to save me from scurvy or something?  I want bourbon, bitters, and sweet vermouth, and go easy on everything but the bourbon.  This is no time for creativity.The dessert menu is stupid.  Who follows octopus and rabbit with banana bread and ice cream?  Hire a dessert chef.I would totally recommend Bacaro if you need \"fancy dinner out.\" Sometimes I do.  Sometimes I have parents who need impressing.",

On the whole, the food was very good, but the overall experience fell short of my expectations for other dinners of similar quality that I have had elsewhere.   First, the atmosphere of the restaurant, while nice, did not strike me as anything special.  That said, this could be a product of where I sat.   Even though I placed a reservation close to a week in advance, I found myself sitting at the table nearest to the kitchen with my date.  While she had a view of downtown Champaign and the restaurant's interior, my own view was of a row of temperature controlled wine racks and a junky-looking electrical socket near the kitchen's entrance.     For the appetizer, we had the pizzetta, which didn't strike me as anything special:  just bread, cheese, grape tomatoes, onion, and bacon.   Our entrees-- the braised rabbit and the grouper-- were better, but as others have mentioned, the portions were quite small, even for a restaurant focused on contemporary fine-dining.  Thanks to a bottle of wine and a second helping of bread, nobody left hungry, but with the final bill clocking in at close to $120, it was hard not to walk away with a sense that some of that money could be better spent elsewhere.         Ultimately, in giving Bacaro three stars, I am rating it in the context of other \"fine-dining\" establishments.  The restaurant's chefs clearly know how to cook, and their wait staff is very well trained, but I don't think that either the food nor the space warrants the price that they have set on it.",

I always preferred Radio Maria, Escobar or some other place for a nice meal. So before we set out on a Friday night for Bacaro, I decided to Yelp it and I was (and still am) very suspicious of a few of the reviews.  Here was a place with lots of 1 & 2 star reviews and yet a couple of 5 star reviews, written in great length and gushing detail by Yelpers for whom this was their only review.  So who writes their first and only review in great length and never mentions anything they ordered, just summarizing it as an excellent restaurant, then never subsequently reviews any other restaurant?  I may be a cynic, but it raises red flags....So, we set off to do our own independent research:  Three people on a Friday night.  The place is full, we get one of a couple of available tables, with no reservations.  The waitress was wonderful.  My first requirement to enjoy a restaurant experience is good service, and she was great.  She knew the menu, she was unequivocal when we asked her what she liked.  She kept her distance and watched us for cues, never interrupting a conversation and never rushing us nor ever making us wait.The wine list is huge, the drink list is equally huge, but both are very pricey by Champaign standards. My wife's martini was a very full glass, all the way up to the \"c\" section as we Assembly Hall fans would say.We had a risotto special with fish \"for the table\", one mixed green salad, and one fried pork belly starter.  The pork belly was $10 and was the size of a large marshmallow in the center of a 12 inch plate, humorous by its dinkyness. But good, like a chunk of fried bacon fat.Then we had three entrees, all were very good.  Mine was the grouper ($28) and frankly I don't recall my companion's meals because we also knocked down one martini and two bottles of Cote D' Rhone between the three of us.  The Cote D' Rhone was $28/bottle and the lowest price wine on the list.  Several other wines could be had in the high $30's, and then the rest of the list was north of $40.One apple pie ala mode later and the three of us were out of there for $192 before tip; and she was worth the $40 tip we left, so by the end of the day it approached $77 per person.So if you start a Yelp review at a three, this place gets one more star for having a great server, one star for being in DT Champaign and being beautiful inside & out, including cloth hand towels in the loo.  Then I'll knock one star off for being too pricey for the market, but if Yelp allowed half-stars I'd give Bacaro 4.5.",

We didn't go for the menu tasting but instead we ordered a couple of entrees. My wife had the chicken and I had the ribeye. Both were cooked very nicely and the unique ingredients made the meals slightly different, but for the prices they charge the taste of each was really just average. My steak wasn't very tender or all that flavorful. Her chicken was cooked decently enough but again the flavor was really just average. I thought maybe because we were there on the Sunday before Labor Day, that maybe it was an off night. But I just couldn't get past the fact that when a place must such a high price on their menu, there really shouldn't be such a thing as an \"Off Night\". The atmosphere and the waiter we had were very nice. So here is my take. Wait staff 3-4 starsAtmosphere 4-5 starsWine list 4-5 StarsBeer list 3-4 starsMenu 4-5 stars Food 2-3 stars I probably wouldn't go here again just because its priced to high to take a chance on a very average meal.

We were forced to listen to a guest M.D. present a PowerPoint talk on male sexual dysfunction for almost an hour while we were having dinner. It was so loud that we couldn't have a conversation at our own table. It was a very unpleasant dinner. A good restaurant is not just about food, but also about ambience. The atmosphere was absolutely horrible for the customers who were not part of the conference. The soup was also extremely salty. This place tries to be fancy, certainly in price, but it is only mediocre in both taste and atmosphere.",

The food however was just a bit too out of the ordinary for me. I prefer classic dishes done to a high standard over the creative and stronger-flavored inventions they had here. I found the food more interesting than delicious, which in the end left me a little disappointed.If your palette is bored, adventurous, and experienced you might like Bacaro, I'm not quite there yet.",

They seem to be particular to detail, which is a plus to me!The wine is top notch too.Honestly, anyone who finds Bacaro pretentious must be insecure, or needs to be more social.

We shared a couple of appetizers and entrees and everyone loved every dish we had.  The resounding favorite was the octopus appetizer which was tender and flavor- full.   The beef tenderloin was charred nicely on the exterior and was cooked to a perfect pink.  The seared scallops with Myers Lemon were refreshing and light.  The gnocci was a showstopper as was the risotto with black truffles and the duck breast.  We asked Thad, the chef, to choose a bottle of wine based on our menu selections which enhanced the experience!  The entrees run between $25-$32 and makes a great choice for a special occasion.",

We ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, and, because I wasn't feeling very adventurous, chose the oven roasted chicken as my entre.  Overall, I found both these dishes a little too salty (maybe the chef was just having an off night?).  The portions are modest, but you would probably expect a little more for the price you're paying.  They did have a decent cheesecake and the check came out with a couple yummy chocolate chip meringues, but overall I guess I was a little disappointed.In consensus with what many others have said, service was very attentive, but I felt it was almost to the point of pretentiousness.  Based on this experience alone, I would most likely not recommend Bacaro's nor dine here again, but I really don't want to dislike this establishment and would like to come back again sometime in the future and give it another chance.  Until then, I say stick with Radio Maria.",

I have read a few reviews that did not like it, and I do understand them, but I love the Danish modern look.  It was done tastefully, and with some thought.If I have one complaint it would be that when I am there I can't decide what to get.  Small menu, but you end up wanting everything on it.

Just when I thought I couldn't eat any thing more fabulous, I had the peanut butter ice cream, which was amazing. I went to Bacaro again tonight (Tuesday April 7) and started with the octopus appetizer, which was startling in a fantastic way in its tomato sauce with shaved chorizo sausage--who knew such flavors could brilliantly mix? I followed this with the strip steak, which exceeded expectations in its deliciousness and perfect serving preparation and size. Although full, I had to finish this outstanding meal with the never-to-disappoint, peanut butter ice cream. It is velvety smooth. As always, my servers, Kyle and Sara were excellent--both knowledgeable and competent. They served an outstanding meal. Bacaro is definitely the place to treat yourself, which never disappoints.",

Food ranges from very good to amazing.  We've never had a bad meal at bacaro.You can throw down a lot of money here, but you don't need to.  The bar is great, they have reasonable and interesting wines by the glass, and you can have a few appetizers or smaller courses and leave without spending too much and but still feeling like you had a special night out.Highly recommended.",

It had a really nice atmosphere, quality food, and good wine.I was impressed that time was taken to talk to my wife and I to find a wine to pair with both of our meals.  The pairing was correct and the wine went well with our meals.  It was somewhat amazing also the fact that it wasn't a very expensive wine that was suggested.This is a very good place to eat in the Champaign area.  The reason I gave it 5/5 (instead of 4/5) is because even though the food is a little over priced in my mind, the service, atmosphere, and location lend to it receiving a 5/5.",

I will go back just for it.The atmosphere in the lounge area was calm and quiet (no tv's or rowdy people).Will go back for dinner soon.",

We entered the restaurant and the place was packed. It was about 6:30. We didn't have to wait long before they offered us a table in the bar room. The ambience was nice and the food was delicious.Our wait staff was a little slow and it took them a while to come around to refill our water and our bread basket, but the entree and overall experience made up for it.I ordered their white sangria. I must tell you that if you like sweet and fruity drinks, definitely order it it. It was so good that my friends decided to order it as their second drink.For our food, we decided to start off with the Coconut-crusted shrimp with orange-jalapeo dipping sauce. It was pretty good. The best part was the sauce.My entree, I ordered the Phyllo-wrapped lamb loin filled with goat cheese, rosemary, and coriander, served with red-skin mashed potatoes and port reduction. It it a mouthful to say and I must say that it is worth every word. The lamb was cooked perfectly and all the sides were very complimentary. I would definitely order this dish again.Overall, I give this place an A. I would definitely go back to try all the other dishes on their menu.",

Service: Decent and attentive once we flagged someone down and asked to talk to someone about ordering! It took them about 5 minutes to get to that point.Appetizer: We had the morrocan-style mussels; probably the only well-seasoned dish of the night. Tasty, but not the best I've ever had.Entrees: The seafood paella is not a paella; its a bunch of seafood in a pot, with rice and sauce buried at the bottom. It was a beautiful presentation, and the seafood was cooked well but woefully underseasoned. None of the sauce touched the seafood, and the sauce was sub-par at best. It's Latin American food, right? Seasoning?!The phylo-wrapped lamb is an inventive dish, and beautifully presented. I think their chef went to beauty school, not culinary school. Again, underseasoned and the glaze seemed to be missing something...salt probably. Drinks: The mango margarita tasted like it was laced with lighter fluid or nailpolish remover. Their wine selection was really good.",

The seafood dishes like the sauteed shrimp and scallops and seafood paella also contained nice large juicy pieces of seafood, although only a few pieces. The rice on the paella as surprisingly flavorful although a little wet. The crema catalana I tried was also prepared very nicely with a crunchy caramelized sugar top over tasty custard that wasn't too thick and tempered with just the right amount of citrus. Overall, the food texture, temperature, and flavor was great -- however the small portion sizes for the price make me hesitant to award the final star.",

For the entree, I had the chicken mole.  The waiter described the mole precisely which was excellent since it was the sole reason for choosing it.  However, the sauce was poured over a very small half chicken with skin and bones resulting in little meat and lots of picking through the skin and bones to find said meat.  The fresh squeezed limeade could have used more lime juice.The restaurant itself is comfortable and inviting.  Service was excellent.",

We got there before the dinner rush and there were several empty tables so we were seated qucikly.  The waiter came to our table right away and told us about the specials etc.  We ordered drinks and our dinner and still the resturant was not quite half full.  We waited for our meal as the resturant filled up.  We knew it would take a little longer than chain resturants as the food was cooked to order and that was ok, but 50 minutes late we were still waiting and realized that most people around us had their meal already. that was about the time the waiter came up to let us know the \"computer had eaten our order and it had been so long since it took the order he forgot what we'd ordered\"  We should have left at that point, but didn't, and re-ordered.  There was no rush placed on our dinners as people who we heard order at that time got their food just before we did.  In all we waited an hour and 20 minutes to get our food.  Before the waiter told us our order had been eaten the service was great and glasses were kept full, after that we only saw him when we got our food and check.  I sort of expected them to discount the meal.  We'd put almost 2 hours on the meter (as the lot was full) and barely made it back before our time expired.  I'll probably go back for lunch, but I doubt they will make the cut for dinner again :(",

This was my first trip to escobar but middle son, who had been there before, refused to go because he claimed the atmosphere was too uninviting.  This was unusual for him to refuse to go out because he is a serious boy-about-town and never misses an opportunity to experience anything.OK, i'm sorry to say the aesthetic sensibilities of my 12 year old are a bit more fine tuned than whoever designed the interior of this restaurant.  It's all hard surfaces so the feel is very cold and extremely loud.  I asked my husband twice throughout the meal if he would be mad at me if I asked the people at the table next to us to stop laughing in such an annoying pitch.  Since he reminded me that i am not Larry David and nobody would find it funny, i refrained.  onto the food.  we had a spinach salad with mangos, shrimp, cucumbers, and red onions in a citrusy dressing.  this was good.  definitely fresh.  then we had a grouper over rice with veggies...eh, it was ok.  very large portions as in enough to feed 2 hungry adults, which worked well since we shared everything.  the fish was very fresh though so i give it 4 stars for that.  then we ordered coffee and bananas flambe.  the coffee had to be sent back because it was so weak and instead we ordered espressos.  i rarely ever send anything back probably because i hate wasting anything, but this was reeeeeeeeeeeeeally bad coffee.  Our waitress even agreed that she has to doctor her coffee when she drinks it here due to the weakness.  But the bananas and the caramel sauce...now that is worth 4 stars.  Would i go back?  No.  Should you try it?  Yes.  There seemed to be a lot of people there having a good time, laughing loudly.",

As is the case with Milo's, the dressings on the salads were divine.  Escobar's is not cheap, so minus one star, but it's a great destination for those special evenings when you are willing to spend some money on a nice meal out.  The white sangria was particularly noteworthy.My complaints would be that they were stingy with the bread.  They only gave us three slices of bread, a boring white and wheat and then some sort of corn foccicia thing that was really good, but two of us had to split a small piece so I really didn't get to enjoy it.  Also, on the jicama orange salad I had, they served the orange in slices rather than segmenting them.  This meant chewing on nasty orange membranes instead of simply enjoying the lovely combination of flavors in the salad.  I know it's probably more labor intensive for the kitchen, but when a diner pays $7 for a salad, you need to segment the damn oranges.  Overall though, these were really small things that really didn't damage my overall enjoyment of the evening.  My entree and dessert were absolutely wonderful, and the service couldn't have been better.  The food wasn't spicy at all, but was still very flavorful.  I personally would like to see a little kick added to some of the dishes, but it would be icing on the cake and they are fine without it.All in all, I really enjoyed my dinner at Escobar's and plan to go back.  It's not cheap, so I won't be a regular, but I certainly plan on coming here for birthday dinners and the like.",

It's nicely done but unpretentious. The wait staff was incredibly friendly. Refills were quick in coming and we got our food very quickly. As you waited you are served a basket of various tasty breads.We started with the coconut shrimp. It was absolutely delicious with huge, perfectly cooked shrimp covered in a tasty coating. The coating was very light and wasn't as sweet as some coconut shrimp can be (I think that was a plus) and it was served with a slightly spicy sauce and and a small bed of greens, onions and mango. The flavors were spot on. You only get four shrimp total but the shrimp are quite large and it was a good size portion for an appetizer.I had the chicken mol for my entree. Finally I have found a good mol in Champaign! I seriously had given up hope of finding a decent version of this sauce here, let alone an excellent version. I've tried just about ever mol sauce in town and it's almost universally bland with little more flavor than the sauce black beans are canned in. But this sauce had a great smokiness, a slight cinnamon undercurrent and the perfect amount of spice. It's served over two large pieces of chicken, still on the bone. The chicken was wonderfully cooked. The presentation was also a plus. It was served with Mexican rice, black beans, cooked fresh vegetables,  a fresh salsa and two large plantain chips all on a banana leaf-covered plate. The portion is nicely sized. Every element of this dish was superb. I really cannot find a fault with any of it and everything went so well together. The vegetables were even cut beautifully!My dining companion had the lamb dish and from the bite I had it was phenomenal as well. We finished off the night by sharing the chocolate-covered orange cake with raspberry cream. I would probably be a little afraid of how something like that might turn out if the meal I'd had wasn't so delicious. The desert did not disappoint.It's not a cheap place to eat dinner, although I took a look at their carry out lunch menu and they had some really great options all in the $10 - $11 range. And sometimes you really do get what you pay for.",

I also tried the carne asado (medium-well) and it was also a wonderful dish with tortillas, assorted veggies, and rice and beans. Their beer selection has some variety in case wine or sangria is not for you and if you are sick of the usual suspects. I have gone here three times and it still never disappoints.

I called back a week before we went to make sure they didn't screw up our reservation. They assured me that the reservation was still there.Well, it wasn't. They screwed up our reservation, and we had to wait till 9:10 pm to be seated. The group ahead of us, who DIDN'T make a reservation, got a table before us. I asked if there's a point at all to make a reservation, and the owner stuttered. The owner then attempted to seat 5 of us at a small table meant for 4 at most which I thought was a little ridiculous. Being a server myself, I could've found a better spot ESPECIALLY when there's an empty 2-person table that could easily be joined to my table. FYI, the place was busy, but it was NOT packed since it's 8:30 pm on a Sunday night. The also had a special graduation menu which is almost identical to the regular menu but pricier. Food was good, but not great. We got 2 appetizers and 5 dishes, and we all sampled each other's. I liked the duck and the tilapia entree the most. I don't think anyone liked the chicken with mole sauce at all, but at least it was tenderly cooked. I got the red sangria which I didn't really like, but my dad did.This place didn't blow me away like I hoped it would. I've had better food in Champaign.",

We shared the guacamole appetizer, I had spinach salad with mango Chile dressing, strawberries and candied walnuts and for my entree, mushroom ravioli with saffron cream sauce.  Daughter had the beef kabobs and mango/rum cheesecake for dessert, and hubby had the roasted chicken with mole sauce.  They have a nice selection of beer and wine by the glass.  Waiter was attentive, but not intrusive, presentations were nice.  We all enjoyed our meals and will definitely go back.",

The menu seems to be well-balanced; can't go horribly wrong with any choice.Foods I thought stood out: the Spanish rice (not too dry and nicely spiced) and the Mango-Rum cheesecake (a fluffy cheesecake! tricks you into thinking it's healthier? i'll succumb...).",

The chef poured the corn cream sauce on half of the talapia. A simple and wonderful idea that let us enjoy the dinner in different ways. The side vegetable mix was great too. Obviously cut and cooked right before the meal. The better half had a steak with a port reduction sauce. Same fresh vegetable mix. Note, I mentioned to the waitress I do not like peppers. Without asking she made sure there were none in my dinner vegetables. Good, thoughtful service. Wine menu was OK, but would not stop us from coming back. Easy parking. Outside seating.",

They also own Milo's in bufu, Urbana but as Escobar is the chef, Escobar's is his place.I always have a good time with their wine staff, especially the lovely salty gal that has only been tending a short while but swigs wine like a sailor, which is to say she doesn't take a dainty white-glove approach. She's a no-nonsense, straight-up pro that can take in a mouthful of wine and nail the flavor notes without all the swirling and sniffing and sloshing. It's the only time I've been able to say, \"this one tastes like a chewy, sweaty S&M jock strap\" and have someone know exactly what I mean without further explanation. And despite the fact that she's a beer girl, her vino recommendations (granted the list is not as extensive as other places downtown) are excellent.I've done a few different things on the menu but I always go back to their duck a l'orange. The meat is always cooked to succulent perfection and maybe it's because everything on the plate is a shade of orange but the entire dish tastes juicy, earthy, bright and warm. Like 6pm sunshine! Like it's made from Care Bears! I want to liquify it, put it in an IV and jack the whole tasty lot right into my veins!The mussels are excellent as well and my friend scarfed the ceviche on our last visit (I had my face in the mussels - so much for sharing).The bread is baked in house and they have a bombin' spicy corn focaccia so it's easy to load up on table bread guilt-free because you can't nosh on Escobar bread anywhere else but Escobar's.Most importantly I like this place because the food is so good and the staff is so nice that it doesn't need all the flash and glam of other restaurants to earn five stars on yelp! The closest comparison I have is the cluster of restaurants out in Napa: sun-drenched, family-owned, friendly and in an epic love affair with food. Outdoor seating means gazing into a parking lot as cars zoom by but it is still the only place in Champaign where I am a little saddened at the end of my meal because I don't have four stomachs, four wads of cash and four hours to sit and eat four more servings of Escobar's duck a l'orange.",

She was clearly on a diverse mix of prescription meds, because she had a hard time communicating with us.  The food was cold, because she brought it out one plate at a time for a group of 6, and proceeded to talk our face off as we were about to leave, despite being cold and indifferent during the rest of the meal. A little training might be in order here. Maybe you had the B-team on staff for Easter - but y'all need to check yourself before you wreck yourself.",

The waiter was very personable and helpful with suggestions and descriptions of dishes.  I started with a limeade, and my mom and sister had coffee -- a fantastic blend developed at the Columbia Street Roastery (which is next door).  We were served cornbread with orange zest mixed into the batter.  It was a little bit sweet for my taste (but I tend to prefer more savory cornbread in general).  We ordered platanos fritos, which were subtly spiced with cinnamon, and served with black beans on the side -- they went together surprisingly well.For brunch, I ordered the California Benedict -- avocado, asparagus, and a poached egg atop an english muffin, covered with a chile-spiced hollandaise sauce.  It was quite good -- I thought the little zip in the sauce complimented the eggs nicely, and helped to engage the palate more.  I was told that the crab cake sandwich and the salad with egg were delicious as well.  All told, we had a great meal -- the only complaint I have was that they did not serve all of the entrees at the same time (although the delay was not long, it did serve to make the eggs Benedict a little lukewarm by the time we all started eating).Anyway, to sum up, the atmosphere was nice, the prices reasonable, the service generally good (and always pleasant), and the food delicious -- I will definitely return here when I come to Champaign again!",

The chefs do a terrific job incorporating fresh ingredients with a Latin theme throughout their menu. The brunch is AWESOME. I recommend the eggs Benedict. For lunch, you can't go wrong with the Cuban sandwich. It's been a staple in my diet the past 4 years. The fish tacos are the bees knees and when they have the seafood paella on the menu it's arguably the best dish in town. I highly encourage you all to try the calamari as an appetizer- it's a huge appetizer. I'm craving a Cuban sandwich now, hats off to you Escobar's",

My favorite is a shrimp and scallop lemon cream sauce dish. The merlot braised short ribs are also pretty awesome. Their white sangria is pretty tasty but maybe even a bit too sweet for my tastes. This place is a bit more expensive than your standard restaurant in Champaign, but it is definitely worth it, if only for a treat every now and then. This place has excellent food and the amount is usually more than I can eat in one meal anyway. I love the way the inside is decorated - it feels very festive without being too obtrusive.Also, Escobars is just fun to say.",

The place was recommended to me by a friend as being one of the better restaurants in Champaign, and the menu online looked interesting, so I decided to give it a try for dinner. The restaurant is really big and was pretty empty when I went (around 8pm on a Tuesday night). After pigging out on the complimentary bread and drinking a mango margarita (tasty if a bit too sweet maybe), I started with an appetizer of fried calamari. I should better than to order seafood in the middle of Illinois: it was certainly not terrible, but it wasn't great either... a letdown for the calamari lover that I am. I then ordered the duck breast: the duck itself was not very good (not very tender and slightly overcooked), and it came with steamed vegetables (boring), mashed sweet potatoes (not bad but a little plain), fried plantain chips (good), and roasted pears (definitely the highlight of the dish: these were actually quite delicious). Overall... not a terrible entree but still quite disappointing and a little overpriced. To their defense, the portions were very large and I was completely stuffed by the time I left the restaurant. Friendly service.",

The duck taquitos were dry, like frozen ones that were microwaved a little too long. (And they still sold for around $10 for two taquitos.) And the seafood in the paella ($21) was overcooked, and in a sauce that tasted a lot like Chef Boyardee sauce.My colleagues enjoyed the fish filet dishes, though, so perhaps it may be best to just avoid the dishes mentioned above.Besides that, friendly service and a good beer selection.",

My boyfriend and I went here for our belated Valentine's Day dinner on Saturday and I had never been there before.  When I walked in, I was pleasantly surprised with the warmness of the decor.  It was very cute.However, when we were seated, it took a very long time for our waiter to get to us.  The busboy also kind of tossed/threw the bread bowl on the table which was weird and definitely made me raise an eyebrow.We ordered the guacamole appetizer and a caesar salad to start; my boyfriend ordered the hanger steak and I got the mushroom enchilada.  The guacamole was pretty good and both of us really enjoyed our entrees.  However, the salad failed to come and our waiter only noticed it once he brought over the entrees.  We still got the salad but it was pretty bland and unexciting, despite the enticing description on the menu.The worst part of the evening was the service.  Even though our food was good, we could never find the waiter to refill our water or order dessert.  He took so long we ended up deciding not to get dessert at all.  Even though the interior of the restaurant is cute, I would not go back.  Compared to other places in Chambana, the prices are high and I can also get really good food elsewhere.",

Usually we order wine or beer, but this time got our mixed drink on. She had a super strong sangria that was good once you had a couple of sips and I had a Capirinha (sp?), which tastes like a Mojito w/o the mint, but with tequilla instead of rum (I know its not tequilla, but that is what it tastes like). Anyway, that was really strong, too but was not as tasty as their spicy Bloody Maria that followed.Service was spotty for us. Our server probably should not have been assigned our table, as she was busy with a private party in a special room they have. She did not make it up to us in the al fresco dining section as much as I would have liked. However, she made up for it with a comp on the Bloody Maria, so its all good in this hood.The food was great. We had an app of their stuffed pupusas, a great vegetarian dish that is bready goodness just bursting with latin flavors. I had the enchiladas and she had the pork tenderloin. Both were fantastic and big enough for lunches the day after. Since we were on bikes, they were able to wrap the dishes up extra careful for my backpack, and they made the trip back to Urbana no worse for the wear.BTW- There was an obnoxious 40-something biatch next to us getting all nasty with her server about the (extremely moderate) amount of spice in the food. Its not too spicy. If you are think Escobar's is too spicy, then you will never know the joys you are depriving yourself.",

Escobar's is a gem. I consider it one of the finest restaurants in the area. Escobar is extremely knowledgable and creative in his presentations of Central American cuisine, and the prices are half of what you would expect to pay if you read the menu without the prices.I've eaten here dozens of times, both lunch and dinner. I've never had a bad experience with either the food or the service. House baked rolls or muffins, sometimes sweet, sometimes savory are delivered to your table first off. Then there are several specials of the day. The service has always been prompt and attentive, whether I have eaten alone or in a group of up to twenty people. The first time I had the roast chicken with mole, I was floored. It's very difficult to roast a chicken and have the light and dark meat be perfectly cooked. Escobar's does this, and the mole sauce is spectacular.For lunch I tend toward the sandwiches. The shrimp po' boy (which I order on Cuban bread) is excellent, with black bean corn relish and herb aioli. The Guatemalan Torta is a perfect blend of ingredients. I can't recommend this restaurant highly enough. Better hurry, though...Escobar's lease is up in January 2017, and he's decided to end the business unless he gets a sale offer. That's a pity.",

It's on the higher end of the restaurants for Chambana, and it's nicely done without being too overdone.  I ordered the tilapia, which came in a delicious mixed sauce with sauteed vegetables.  YES.  'Twas wondrous.After a great time chatting with fellow graduate students, professors, and a prospective student, it came time for dessert.  And they had bananas flambe.  Now two of my favourite things in life are desserts and unnecessary applications of fire.  And this bananas flambe was absolutely marvelous.  I was filled with happiness.  And BANANAS.All in all, the service was extraordinarily friendly, the food was well-plated, nicely prepared, and delicious; and the ambiance was pitch perfect.  NICE.",

This was near the top of their list of must-go's.The food was good, but not great, and certainly not amazing.  At our table, we had:- Hanger steak asada - Phyllo-wrapped lamb loin (got the best reviews, but they still weren't enthusiastic)- Sesame-crusted salmon- Sauted shrimp and scallopsThe service was fine, though we were kept waiting for our food for a LONG time.  Plus, all entres but one came out at the same time, and it took more than five minutes for the last to show up.  I hate when they do that... everyone who has their food wants to eat it but feels they need to wait, and the one person who doesn't have their food is left feeling guilty and telling everyone to start.  No thanks.Also worth noting:18% gratuity for parties of 5 or more, \"for our convenience. \" Really?  I've never seen this for under 6, and usually under 8.  This is so they're more sure to get a good-ish tip because they're planning on the party being difficult because of its size.  5 people is not difficult, suck it up.$4 Split plate charge.  Really?  This is not a hoity-toity enough place to pull this off, even in Champaign.  Thanks for putting it on the menu, though, instead of trying to sneak it in... at least you're broadcasting your shortcomings.-Overall, given the weird choices they make, the good-but-not-great food, balanced with the meal prices (most hovering in the $20 entre range), it's solidly a two-star experience.  I wouldn't return.",

I was impressed that everyone found a dish.  Well done Escobar.  Oh, and I recommend a mojito if the weather is warm or maybe if you just are wishin warm breezy thoughts.

Although the dipping sauce sounds hot, it wasn't. It was more of a citrus and jalapeo flavor and it complimented the coconut shrimp quite nicely.  We tried the hanger steak fajitas for our entree.  It's a good thing we were able to split the entree as it would have been way too much for one person.  The steak had a wonderful mole sauce with a little kick. And the vegetables were not typical for fajitas.  Asparagus, carrots, onions, red & green peppers.  Also had a side of black beans and rice with black beans.  The regular margarita was one of the best I have had in a restaurant.  The menu is seasonal and changes quarterly, so you may or may not be able try something that is suggested in the reviews.  Timing is everything! I would definitely go back when I'm visiting Champaign.",

The calamari wasn't the traditional type you'd get at mainstream American restaurants but it was thicker pieces of squid with panko breading. This non-traditional set-up was quite good although the sauce that came with it could be a little bit more tangy. The Moroccan beef soup was very good, beefy but not overbearing. For the entrees, I ordered the Phyllo wrapped lamb and she the duck roast. The lamb was excellent, it came wrapped in a flaky Phyllo pastry and a succulent sauce. The sides were also superb, although I could use a little less garlic in the mashed potatoes. The duck was cooked to perfection, although the plantains and mashed sweet potatoes were left a lot to be desired.We shared dessert, which was the banana flambeed with vanilla bean ice cream. It was amazing, although it is quite hard to mess up something so innately satisfying. Overall, the presentation was superb and the waitress courteous. The atmosphere was fine for the occasion, although my girlfriend did complain about the \"orangy\" walls... haha. In any case, I highly recommend Escobar's for a good meal.",

A basic principle of good resto services is to avoid gratuitous meanness, even during ebertfest. I'm a local, love their food and won't go back. People deserve to be treated with basic civility, esp when they are civil to you. The second waiter's apology later sounded a bit more genuine, but not enough. Goodbye Escobar's.

I was in the mood for Latin-type food and found Escobar's. The boyfriend and I left work around five and arrived at the restaurant around 5:30. I was expecting to be one of the first tables being that it was early. When we arrived there were already 5 or 6 tables seated, I took that as a good sign. We were promptly greeted and shown to a table. We were brought water and bread (delicious, by the way) and within a minute our waiter was at the table greeting us. As we looked over the menu our waiter described the special of the day and gave information on the many delicious sounding menu options. My boyfriend loves calamari so that was a no-brainer for the appetizer. He is pescatarian but the wild mushroom enchilada struck his fancy. His review: The enchiladas were delicious. Most places give you three smaller ones, here you get one large enchilada with a generous amount of filling. The sauce that covers the enchilada has a nice (not overpowering) bite to it. My food: AMAZING. I had the seafood paella, half a lobster, shrimp, and mussels. The lobster and shrimp were perfectly cooked and seasoned well. Some of the mussels were a tad overcooked but based on the rest of the meal I was willing to overlook this tiny misstep. The waiter was well on his game, eyeing our water glasses from across the room and bringing more before we even emptied the glass. We will definitely be coming back!",

                "review": "Escobar's might be the best restaurant in Champaign. The atmosphere is cozy and comfortable. The wait staff has always been pleasant and attentive. And the food is almost always impressive. I'll acknowledge other reviewers who gripe about the time it can take to receive your food. Going to a fine restaurant should be an event, not something you rush through. It's an experience. I've never found a meal here to take longer than similar fine restaurants. A typical meal at Escobar's might last roughly 70 - 90 minutes if you get an appetizer, entree and dessert. Not unreasonable at all, but maybe a little longer than a meal at Chili's, for instance. ;-)As for the food, you'll be served a small basket of assorted breads once seated. These are always fresh, delicious and unique. Some sweet, some savory. I never know what kinds we'll get, and I always get a little bit excited to see what will be in there. Please excuse my nerdiness. Below is a rundown of some of the dishes I've had at Escobar's. Appetizers: Coconut crusted shrimp - fantastic. The shrimp are enormous and perfectly fried. Served with a delicious orange-jalapeno dipping sauce.Duck confit taquitos - a taste sensation, but at $10 for just 2 taquitos, it's a bit of a splurge. Almost an amuse-bouche than a true appetizer. If there were 4 in an order, getting this would be a no-brainer every time. House made guacamole - a huge portion of freshly-made guacamole, served with a heaping pile of warm, roasted tortilla chips. This is a favorite when I come here. Entrees:Filet mignon and andouille sausage kebobs - my new favorite dish. I have never had such tender, melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon in my life. The andouille sausage was a nice, spicy accompaniment. Huge portion. Absolutely delicious. Phyllo wrapped lamb loin - a bit overrated. The phyllo was a little burnt when I ordered this, and there wasn't much of a sauce. Crab cakes with guajillo cream sauce - O.M.G. The crab cakes are light, flaky, fresh, and this guajillo cream sauce - a bright orange sauce, takes this dish to a whole new level. Spicy, smokey - it's a heaping forkful of warm love going in your mouth every few seconds. Love. Sauteed shrimp and scallops - a forgettable, bland dish - and the scallops were gritty (my worst nightmare whenever eating scallops). One of the few disappointments I had when dining here. They do have a small dessert menu. Mango rum cheesecake, lemon curd pie with berries, flan (I never knew I liked flan until I tried it here!). Dessert portions aren't too big, nor too small. The perfect way to end a fantastic meal. Again, service has always been friendly and attentive. Once, we were not waited on for about 10 minutes after being seated. When our waitress realized her mistake, she offered us free soup to make up for it, and gave us excellent service during the rest of our meal. She went out of her way to make it up to us, and we appreciated her enthusiasm. One of my favorite restaurants in the C-U area!",

Last time I went with my lady friend on Saturday before Valentines Day.  Made a reservation which they screwed up and stuck us in a corner four-top while several other more cozy two person tables sat vacant during our whole meal.  Menu was special for valentines day and had several options.  I chose tilapia and my girlfriend got the filet.  Being a wine couple but not familiar with many wines from outside the U.S. I asked for a rec from the server who admitted to having no idea on wine pairing and left to go ask someone.  Even at biaggis their servers are trained in that.  Very disappointing at a higher dollar establishment.  Remainder of meal not impressive.  Tilapia was average and would agree with some of the other posts in that it was too much food and not enough contrast in flavors.  I forgot to mention the coconut shrimp app we got that was also disappointing.  No coconut flavor at all.  Too full for dessert.  Filet that I tried nothing special either.  For my money- Radio Maria, Milos when it was in Lincoln Square(haven't tried new location), even Jim Goulds.  Just so much better service, ambience, and food selection and quality to come back here again.",

Spoiled me forever on a taste that... you just couldn't get _anywhere_.  As a matter of fact, my next trip to Miami, I actually hunted down as many Cuban sandwiches as I could find.  Sure, there were some more authentic, and sure, there were some a little cheaper (you know the nature of street food), but Escobar's did the thing proud, man!Now, I can say that I've not always had the best service in this place, especially when it comes to getting served.  I also found things a little dingy!  The place could use a facelift (or two). =))All-together, though, a nice place to enjoy a little cultural infusion and ham! =D",

It was pretty empty in there, but it was sort of after the lunch rush and it was during the week.  We promptly were served ice cold water and some delicious banana bread muffins with butter for free.  I ordered a freshly squeezed limeade, a nice twist on lemonade.  My friend and I both agreed on getting the Cuban sandwich.  So many different flavors playing into this sandwich.  Sliced ham, a deliciously marinated shredded pork, Monterey-Jack cheese, pickles and a whole seed mustard topped off the sandwich served on baguette bread.  My friend commented on how he doesn't usually enjoy mustard but really enjoyed it on this sandwich.  The sandwich was accompanied by a side of mixed greens in a vinaigrette and some sweet potato fries.  Sweet potato fries are always an A+ in my book and the mixed greens were a good add too.  The fries and salad weren't anything to get super excited about, but definitely yummy and helped fill me up for sure.  Left there with a whole other half of my sandwich and one of the muffins. Lunch is extremely reasonably priced and although I understand it to be a little more expensive for dinner, I can't imagine being disappointed from what I saw from this meal.",

I was down visiting my daughter and she chose a winner!Escobar's has a very inventive menu with a fusion of many latin tastes with its own Ol added to the mixture.  We had the fried calamari for our app, something I would not expect in a Latin restaurant but it was delicious with one heck of a tasty sauce.  I had the Cuban sandwich for my main course and it was crunchy with all the distinct flavors you expect in a Cuban sandwich but with their own version of it.My favorite two beverages in the world are freshly brewed iced tea and bottled Mexican coke and they had both.  Hard choices that are great either way are part of what makes this such a great place.It's more expensive than your typical Mexican restaurant because it is so much more and quite frankly, aren't you worth it?",

(We tasted each other's dishes to verify the deliciousness.) Portabella burger, veggie burger, American Kobe burger, chipotle shrimp skewers, & chorizo stuffed dates wrapped in bacon were their choices. We had two appetizers - cheese curds & tempura-fried asparagus. Yum, yum.One of our dessertw was the highly-promoted banana cream pie. Good, but the bananas were over caramelized.

I'd like to think someone over there read my posts ;) I'm still not a fan of the price points but the food is far more consistent and seems to be better quality. Also really enjoy their coffee and fresh cream after any meal there. Still nothing terribly interesting however everything seems fresh and well executed. Also I am trying to tone down on being such a food snob so... 4 stars!! (throws confetti sarcastically)",

My group of 12 was immediately seated and drink orders were quickly taken. Service was interesting. Although our waiter was excellent, there seemed to be several uncertainties when drinks and food were brought to the table. Things got to where they needed to be, but I was surprised there seemed to be so much trouble just getting the orders to the correct guests.The food was wonderful! We had some excellent shared appetizers -- beer-battered asparagus, stone oven pretzels and beer-battered bacon. I had the Greekish salad and the cedar plank salmon. My wife had bacon & brussels and roasted beet salad. Others had a variety of chicken, seafood and meat entrees. For dessert my wife and I shared the chocolate cake.I tried a few of the four ounce beer samples and had a bloody mary. The beer was very good, the bloody mary excellent in presentation but only average in taste.We were not expecting to spend almost three hours having a leisurely dinner, but the evening was very nice. I was impressed with the general vibe for a Saturday night.All in all, I was impressed with Destihl and will definitely come back to try lunch or perhaps dinner with my wife or a smaller group.",

The restaurant decor is very modern and the menu is impressive - often offering delectable-sounding dishes and impressive combinations. That said, you may be disappointed upon arrival of your meal. The presentation is beautiful, but the taste is so bland. The first time I had a featured soup and sandwich - both just okay. The second time, I had their Rancher burger, which was wayyy overcooked (I asked for medium-rare and got very well done) and the fries were pretty bland. Some words about leftovers from Destihl: you don't want them. They are terrible as next-day meals. Overall, you'll have better luck for your taste buds and wallet by making a trip down the street to Dublin's.",

I don't have very much in the way of complaints about Destihl, but I don't exactly have much that makes me love the place either, especially since it is downtown and it has a lot of competition in the restaurant scene that does a better job. Let's start with the beer. To me, being a \"brewpub\", the quality of the beer is pretty sub par. I've had some good brews, but definitely some bad ones. I was here just last week and got a red ale that tasted more or less like fizzy cough syrup. Not the total end of the world, and beer taste is very subjective, but the beer here isn't exactly cheap and I feel like it's one of their main draws as a brewpub. On the other hand, I don't think I've ever had a bad experience with the food. They have great pizzas with a pretty neat variety of toppings and some pretty killer appetizers, the thai wings and the pretzels are a pretty normal addition to my dinners here. They will consistently cook a cheeseburger medium rare (sad that's something I have to even say) and the other entrees are usually pretty quality. They have a number of specials usually every week too. All in all, this place is certainly not bad, and I would feel a little more comfortable with giving it a 3.5 instead of a 3, but I would rather round down than up. If you haven't visited I definitely would check it out but after you've been here a couple of times I don't think you will get excited to go back.",

                "review": "I have never been more disappointed in my gastronomic experience in Urbana-Champaign then this past weekend at Destihl \"Brewery\" (who knows if they even brew beer at this place). Having been to Destihl a handful of times before the abominable brunch I suffered through this past weekend I expected an experience somewhat similar to what most people describe here on Yelp. That being a friendly staff, and decent (perhaps even good) food at reasonable prices. Unfortunately, Destihl has suffered a complete drain of quality over the last few years. When it opened, Destihl offered hot, quality food served my intellectual and friendly servers who were happy to be working in one of Champaign's better restaurants. Each time I dined at Destihl I noticed the quality of the food, the quality of the service, and the quality of the dining experience was eroding away. This erosion culminated with the brunch a group of friends and I endured this past Sunday. I say endured because our meal lasted from 12:30p.m. until 2p.m. The absurd elongation of our meal was not caused by entrancing, deep conversation amongst old friends, or by laggard mastication of our fantastic food. The epoch that was our brunch at Destihl was caused solely by the complete ineptitude and incompetence of our server, the manager, and Destihl as an establishment. To begin, our waiter spoke to our group at a volume slightly above \"whisper\". He seemed to not care at all that our decently sized group would likely give him his biggest tip of the day. One could almost assume our waiter was indentured to Destihl and taking our orders, suggesting menu items, and assuring that we were taken care of was a reminder of the chains that confined him. After taking our orders, three of which were simply \"eggs, bacon, and potatoes\" (not worth the $10), our group set off on the marathon that ninety minutes later would end in us getting our food. In total our group would watch at least seven other parties wait for a table, be placed near us, taken care of by the same subjugated waiter, eat, pay their bill, and depart. After the fourth group who had arrived after us was served before us, a member of our group called the manager over. At this point we had spent 45 minutes ordering and waiting. By this point the waiter had been unable to provide any information about our meal besides, \"they are still working on it, should be out soon.\" This information was decrypted by the members of our group through the reading of his lips and not by any sort of audible understanding between him and ourselves. We hoped the manger could provide us with additional information, this would prove to be a fool hearted assumption.The manager assured us he would check on our order and would return shortly. After three more groups consumed their meals, paid their tabs and departed, and another half an hour passed, the manager had not returned. At this point our group decided that if our food did not arrive by 1:45 PM. we would simply stand up, leave, and eat fast food. Finally, at 1:43p.m., 1 hour 13 minutes after arriving our meal was served. Destihl was relatively empty when we arrived and continued to be throughout our meal. Yet, our food took longer to cook than the run time of the original 1931 version of Frankenstein. If you have been to Destihl for brunch you know none of the menu items are difficult to cook, they are largely egg dishes accompanied by breakfast meats, french toasts, or a hot sandwich. Since this experience ended I have wondered what took so long for our food to be cooked and leave the kitchen. I have surmised that the reasons for our hour and a half endeavor are a product of the poor quality that now defines Destihl. First, our waiter did not care about us nor did he serve as our representative in the kitchen. Second, the cooks clearly lost track of our order because some food came out steaming hot, some came out only partially complete, and the rest came out lukewarm (presumably having spent an hour under a heat lamp). Finally, the manager who never returned to our table and only after being called over again offered excuse after excuse before finally saying, \"Well, I am sorry.\"To anyone who has invested the time to read my review, thank you. To anyone who has spent the time to read my review and still intends to go to Destihl even after I have made clear my utter frustration and disappointment, I wish you the best of luck. To conclude, my friends and I will never eat at Destihl again and I look forward to the restaurant that will soon replace it.",

For a Monday night, business was okay, but waiting 40 minutes for food is inexcusable. I had the Beer Battered Bacon Burger with an Egg, and it was below average. It would have been your average burger if the patty had any flavor.. But the meat was simply tasteless. The beer battered bacon is quite tasty, but the nothing I would crave for. The only reason I give this place two stars is for the Strawberry Ale that I got to try. The beer was light and smooth, it complimented my meal.

The pretzel was also good - a little burnt in places but nothing too aggravating. It came with nacho cheese and mustard. Our server had the chef chop it up into bite size so we could share easily. Very thoughtful. For my lunch entree, I ordered the Dijon chicken. It came with two asparagus and mashed sweet potatoes with sausage chopped up in it. for about $10, i would order this over and over again.

After finding a list of top restaurants online, we ended up settling on Destihl due to the large menu with seemingly lots of tasty options.We made a reservation for a Monday night and we were seated right away. Parking can be a bit difficult mid-evening. We had to circle around the nearby city lot to finally find a spot. My order: Chorizo stuffed dates to share and Thai steak salad.Other orders: Clam chowder (the soup of the day), House salad, Spicy Thai shrimp, and Pesto Chicken (recommended by the waiter).The dates came out first. I didn't realize they were going to be wrapped in bacon. But score, I love it that way. The bacon needed to be cooked a bit more though. They had a nice kick to them. They were enjoyed for the most part, but these are much better in Atlanta.As for main meal, the accidentally brought my mom a Caesar salad instead of the House salad. She was going to order it but changed her mind. The waiter forgot to write down the change. He came out quickly to apologize after it was delivered. The salad is a wedge salad with a crispy toast in place of croutons and a fried egg. My mom wasn't excited about the fried egg and gave it to us. I tasted it but didn't like it so passed it on to my brother. How do you mess up a fried egg?My Thai steak salad was not very good. The steak was cooked more medium than medium well. There was not much of it. The greens were kinda soggy. The peanuts were way too salty. Much better in Atlanta, again.Overall, portion sizes were adequate and we got our fill. We signed up for a rewards card that evening and were able to apply the purchase that we had just made to our rewards card. That was great. Even though I may not be back. There were plenty of other options that seemed great on the menu, but hesitant after this experience. Plus there are other places to try in the city.Everyone else liked their food. So that's something. I was going to give them 3 stars given everyone else's satisfaction. But then I realized that I had noted in our reservation that we were celebrating my dad's birthday. They didn't do anything to signify that. Not even a happy birthday. Nothing! So 2 stars it is.",

                "review": "I'm so disappointed. I'm in champaign visiting my sister, and a friend of ours recommended we go to Destihl. He touted it as a gift from the gods. Like so good hat he went there for lunch and dinner one day and then came back for brunch the next morning. After looking at the menu, how could I resist??So we went today for a late lunch (around 2:30) and found the place pretty much deserted. There were some people working in the bar who made eye contact with us but didn't come up to the host stand to seat us. So we waited. And waited. And finally a hostess came and brought us to a cavernous booth in the bar. Where we waited. And waited. And listened to awful terrible music (read: Dave Matthews Band)A female server came to get our drink orders and informed us that Michael would be our server. Ok, so the do team service, I'm on board with that. But Michael didn't come with our drinks. Someone dressed like a manager did. And Michael didn't take our food order. A woman who we later learned was a manager did. I think Michael maybe refilled our drinks? The first manager looking guy dropped off our apps. Here's the skinny on what we had:Beer battered bacon: this is worth a star. It was greasy but oddly delicious. Brussels sprouts: flavor was good but they were still pretty hard in the middle. Bacon Egg and Cheese Deviled Eggs: nothing to write home about. They were small and pretty smoky tasting.  For entrees, I ordered the fried egg BLT and my sister ordered the bison burger. My BLT was fine. Again, nothing to write home about. There was some sort of mustardy vinaigrette on the greens that was overpowering. And the egg could have been runnier. But another star goes to the fries which were hot and crispy and delicious. My sister ordered her burger medium and it came out completely well done. Like \"we think this bison is dead but let's burn it at the stake just to make sure it's really really dead.\" She decided to send it back and so we waited. And waited. And a brand new server (still not Michael) came by to check on us. She went back to the kitchen to have them make a new burger and left the old one so my sis could nibble on the fries. Her friendly attitude and apologies would have garnered another star, but I was SO put off when she came back to tell us that her manager wanted to let us know that she put the order in correctly and that the cooks are the ones who screwed up. Umm... Why wouldn't the manager come over herself to apologize? Or at least to check on us after the replacement came? And also, it is so not cool to throw your kitchen staff under the bus like that. All in all, Destihl has good bacon, inattentive staff, poor leadership, and too much desire to be \"cool.\" And where is Michael? My receipt says he was my server but I don't even know if I saw him, and I fear my tip went to someone who didn't do any work! I won't be back.",

Omg, I just realized that delish is almost an anagram for Destihl.  So shall I say it was delisht*?Too many other things were off about the meal for me to want to return.  Too bad because those desserts sound alluring (pumpkin bread pudding!).- It took way too long for the waiter (who said he was new) to come back for our order.  Another waitress actually came by to ask how we were doing because she saw us looking around. - Long wait for the appetizers.  How long does it take to send over some cheese curds, bacon wrapped dates, and nachos?  The nachos arrived last.  I didn't time it, but the meal was a solid hour and 45 minutes.  I wasn't crazy about the nachos, but the cheese curds were my second fave after the dates.- My bison burger was extra dry (and I've had juicy bison before), and the bun it came on was too crumbly and dry as well.  I took 2 bites and ditched the rest of the bun.And the last and final straw:- My colleague clearly ordered the Carolina pork two ways (the entree is actually like 5 or 6 words on the menu, and he read off every word), but what was served to him was the Carolina wings.  He ended up just eating it because it would've taken forever for the correct entree to come out, based on our experience with the apps and entrees.  Also, rather than bringing out a free dessert or comp'ing the entree off the bill, we were still charged for the incorrect order, and waiter just kept saying thanks for understanding, and \"the wings tasting good?\"  That is actually the first time in life that I've seen an entree get messed up, and it's still charged on the final bill.  Wth?  I spoke to a manager, who removed the item from the bill.*the t is silent.  Duh!",

We had a big group, 16 people, and it didn't take nearly as long as I thought it would for our food to get to us. I also have a baby and a stroller and the host was great about getting her a high chair before we even asked, and was very chill about finding a place for the stroller and just having the baby around in general. The food was delicious. I had a Thai steak salad, and the steak came on its own next to the salad so you can cut it yourself and get the full delicious steak experience and not lose any juiciness. The steak was tender and cooked wonderfully, and the salad was nicely spicy, with some spicy peanuts that I think they make in-house. Good deal for $12, in my opinion, or at least not overpriced compared to restaurants with similar food. My husband had the fish and chips, which I thought were pretty nice too. Potato wedges were a bit salty, but I love salt, so I was happy. Beer-wise, I had a house IPA that was good but not great. Would go again for a nice meal out. It seems like a good place to go on a date or celebrate an event, and they seem to handle large groups well.",

Their heffeweissen is really excellent. The apricot brew actually tastes like apricot; I tend to like fruity beers, and this one stood out to me. Their cocktails are also really, really good. I had the sake lemon drop and was not disappointed. Appetizers: Hands down, no contest, their beer-battered asparagus takes the gold. Its a lighter batter, more like a very gentle tempura than a \"fried chicken\" type fry. The honey-whatever sauce they serve with it is incredible, and they serve a grilled lemon with it that you probably aren't supposed to eat but tastes like candy so do it anyways. The shrimp ceviche is nothing to write home about. The shrimp skewers entree was tasty and well seasoned, but if you came with a big appetite, it might not be the choice for you. Their portions (one of the things I like most about Desthil) are reasonable and not out of this world for most of the main dishes. My boyfriend wasn't totally full when he left, but comfortable. The thai steak salad is incredible! I like a little spice, and this definitely had that! It's not big, but its delicious. Their pizzas are also fabulous, if a little salty. You can't complain that they underseason like some places in downtown Champaign. The seabass dish (I think it was a special) was definitely worth it. They do their cubans right; their mustard is homemade I think and really rounds it out. Overall, loved it. Decently priced for what you get, and you get a great night out!",

I noticed some people complained about the prices, but for the quality of food, this is really much cheaper than something comparable in the Chicago suburbs although the portions aren't exactly huge. But it's pretty in line with prices and portion sizes at other restaurants in downtown. The menu is quite unique for the area and similar to what you'd find in a lot of Milwaukee restaurants.I really enjoyed everything from the American Kobe burger to the Beer-battered cod. The textures and variety of flavors were great and not too salty. The sandwiches and soups were also pretty light and refreshing. I particularly enjoyed the tomato soup and corn & chicken chowder soups. The dessert choices were quite varied but i was so full I didn't have room for more than one. The stout ice cream sandwiches had a really nice stout ice cream between brownie circles. It was a perfect way to end the meal.Given the quality of cooking and good prices, I'll definitely be back here soon.Update: Upon visiting a few more times, I still think this is a good restaurants but there are a couple notes.The price complaints I see from some reviews may be due to the varying sizes of some dishes. For example, the thai mussels appetizer is quite a bit smaller than some other items although the prices are similar. Also, the chocolate cake is a giant portion compared to the bread pudding.I'm not a big fan of anything Asian themed I tried here as I found the flavors to be too strong. I prefer it to be more delicate although some patrons may appreciate the bold flavors. I wasn't a big fan of the pizzas either. They were large in size but the dough was too moist for me and I didn't like the flavor combinations I tried.I did like the teas I tried as they were high quality organic tea bags. The coffee is a mix of two Kenyan coffees with a full bodied flavor from their supplier in Bloomington served with fresh cream. The shrimp frittata comes with a generous amount of shrimp flavored with shrimp stock, probably the best frittata I've ever eaten. The cuban style pork sandwich was done well but not as legendary as other reviewers make it out to be. The Potts roast was also done well but not worth a special note. The potato crusted rainbow trout was done well with good presentation but I wish the portion size could have been a little larger. The dijon chicken was moist and flavored well but, the real star of the dish was the asparagus that was cooked and flavored excellently.The apple fritters dessert had crispy fritters but the toughness of the peel wasn't that appealing. If it were substituted with something like apple chips or churros, I probably would have enjoyed it more. If the goal is to keep an apple-like look, possibly fried colored dough is a better substitute. The chocolate cake is a whole pound with chocolate layering instead of cream. This was done well and not overly sweet, a very good choice for chocolate lovers.  The sour cherry bread pudding was done well, a little too sour for me but a solid choice. I would've preferred a couple elements to vary the texture inside but that might not fit the overall theme of the dish.",

Not only were we waiting 30 minutes, four parties similar in size were seated within 5 minutes.  She was rude and if she were our only interaction with the restaurant, I'd never want to come back.The food was not bad, the ancho chip crusted pork loin was huge and delicious, fish and chips had a great batter on it, both top notch. However, the spicy chipotle chicken sandwiches was well seasoned, but could use a little more substance than just chicken and arugula.  There was too much bread for the sandwich. As for sides, the potato wedges were not bad, french fries were soggy and floppy.Four stars for the food, three for the hostess.",

I was really pleased.I ordered an iced tea and I think it's my own fault for not looking at it on the menu, but I expected a regular iced tea.  Their iced tea is an orange tea that has a pretty strong orange flavor.  I wasn't a fan.

Maybe it iwas the fact that we checked it out 4 days after it opened, but of the 5 beer styles we got, 4 of them were \"off\".  One was clearly oxidized (badly), one was infected to lacto and tasted very funy and the other two mildly oxidized.  We hoped the manager would come visit with us, but no luck.  The bartender indicated that depending on the time of day, the beer tastes different from the yeast.  First time I have heard of that.  Food was decent, but I have had better pub grub.  Maybe the beer just ruined my taste buds.  (Positive) The pizza is HUGE .  .enough for two to share or one very hungry person.Hopefully they figure things out.  Have been frequently brewpubs throughout the US in the last 12 years and can honestly say it was the oxidized beer and infect beer were the worse I have ever had.  Even my earliest botched homebrews were not that \"off\".  Gave it two stars since it was the first week it was open and the possibilities it was growing pains.",

Our booth was large and comfy.  Our waiter was knowledgeable and just friendly enough.  Can quickly become pricey if you stay a while and dive into the small plates and drinks.I was overwhelmed by the drink menu and ended up going with my old standby, the dirty Martini.  My first one with organic corn vodka, which made for a smooth sipping drink.  Loved it.  J tried two different drinks (so I got to try them too) over the course of our dinner, both of which were delicious and pleasantly spiked with liquor.We tried two different apps - the Beer Battered Bacon and the House Olives (our 2nd choice when we were told they'd just run out of the deviled eggs).  The bacon was not greasy at all, and the maple chipotle drizzle was the perfect topper.  The olives were meh, just not necessary - and I don't think my opinion was swayed too much by the fact that I really, really wanted those deviled eggs!Next up, a la carte soup.  I went with the Beer & Cheddar soup, which was close to great with discernible beer and cheese flavors.  J chose the soup du jour, Cream of Asparagus - excellent fresh asparagus flavor here.  Both soups were wonderfully creamy.  Bowls were decent-sized for $5.My entree was a Thai shrimp and noodle dish (I'm a sucker for coconut curry sauces).  Nice amount of shrimp, but no noticeable spice to the dish.  A bit of a disappointment.  J's beer-brined double pork chop was an amazing dish, not to mention huge.  Perfectly pink pork.We parked in a nearby parking garage as the lot across the street was full.  I would return and try everything new (other than my Martini).",

It's often the gathering point for business events or company dinners, which brings a lot of patrons to this restaurant. There's a good selection of beer that's, judging by the brewing equipment in the restaurant, presumably brewed in-house (and maybe some off-site) as well as a decent menu showcasing modern American fare.  Usually, a drinking establishment that decides to start cooking ends up making subpar food, while a restaurant that makes good food has a lackluster beer selection. Of course, this isn't always the case, but I usually don't go to bars for their food, and restaurants for their beer. Destihl, however, strikes a good balance between the two camps.  I had a chicken pot pie when I went there, while my dining companion had stuffed peppers. Both were perfectly fine, but nothing to write home about. The menu is made up of conventional American dishes, but unfortunately nothing too unique. You'll find everything you want here for a great meal, but nothing that truly catches your eye.  Overall, the service was excellent, our waiter had insightful knowledge on the beer selections, and the atmosphere here was just right. I feel like their menu is a bit too unoriginal to justify the price, but regardless, I'm sure you'll enjoy your meal here anyways.",

Luckily for me I had not been highly anticipating the opening of Destihl. The beers were good enough. There were about a dozen to choose from so if you drink beer at all, you should be able to find one you like. The night we went in we were given free 2oz samples of as many of the beers  as we wanted to try. I tried the Belgian, Strawberry Blonde and Raspberry Wheat, Champaign Blond and Frankengluten - good flavors, but none will be appearing on my all-time favorites list. The Frankengluten was interesting and worth a try if you are adventurous. Our waiter was nice and attentive enough but could not properly give drink recommendations since he was not old enough to drink. I thought this strange since, clearly, patrons are going to want to know about the beer. The food... I had the brie and portabello sandwich with chips. The chips were average and the sandwich was bland. That's honestly about the best I can say. My dinner partner said his steak salad was excellent and it looked fresh and crisp, but I can't vouch for the taste. We split the beer battered asparagus and that was by far my favorite item. I will probably go back at some point for another try. The pizza and a desserts sounded like they may have potential.Second visit 8/27/11: Finally tried the pizza (pesto and goat cheese) and still really no change in my review. Nice wait staff but the food does not overly impress. You do receive a large quantity of food for the price. Although, for me, quantity does not trump quality.",

We ordered our drinks and food and all was well.  However, an hour later our server explained that there were a number of large parties who were getting their food before us so it was taking this long.  He delivered our food and never came back to the table. My order was correct and fairly tasty but my wife's order was wrong and there was never anyone to ask about correcting it.  Very long wait for the wrong food and very disappointed in our experience.  There are quite a few restaurants downtown, this will not be on our short list for another visit.",

Service was very slow, but since it's the first weekend of operation, I'm not going to take any points off. The decor was really nice, cosy, and even a little cosmopolitan. I got the pesto chicken pasta which I thought was good, but nothing to get excited about. I tried the fried cheese appertiser, and while good, they also weren't anything to write home about. Overall, food was good, but not great. There are better restaurants elsewhere.The drinks, on the other hand, were good AND also reasonably priced which I did not expect. They had a big beer, wine, cocktail, and martini menu. I tried a couple of different beers, and they were all really good for the most part. They also had 4 oz portion which was a great way to try different beers, and the 4 oz portion is surprisingly not priced proportionally any higher than its 12 oz counter part. Destihl seems like the ideal place to get dinner before a night downtown. Great ambient, great location, great drinks, and good food. Even though it's not anywhere near there yet, I'm sure that it has the potential to be the best place in a couple of months.",

The wagyu burger is advertised as coming with a \"golden brioche bun\", but the bun we received looked like the average bun you get at Walmart for a picnic; thin, flat and crumbling. We asked the waitress if there was some mistake but she confirmed that, indeed the bun we received was the \"golden brioche bun\". Either the waitress was mistaken, or this restaurant does not know what a brioche bun is. I guess it's also possible that I have no idea what a brioche bun should look like. I uploaded a photo of the bun if you guys want to see for yourself.",

They're not quite there yet, BUT this four stars is partially based on potential. I don't know if that's acceptable for Yelp, but whatever.I will admit I got a little gluttonous this evening. Ideally, I wouldn't have eaten as much as I did, but it was what it was. I started off with some of the home brews. I did the the little 4 oz guys and out of the four I tried, I liked three enough to drink again (the Belgian ale was a bit too hoppy for my liking). At $1.25 each (or $5 for the 4), I don't mind one I didn't like.Next I went with the beer-cheese soup. WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT. It was amazingly good. Also, at my table were some cheese curds and I will dare say that these curds were the finest curds I have ever eaten (and I've had them in Wisconsin too). For my entree, I went with the bison burger which was flavorful - although I will echo the review who noted that their meat was overcooked - and I appreciated that fries were included. The fries were awesome - shoestring style and were not oversalted, but weren't seasoned improperly either (just right!).For dessert it was baked apples with butter pecan ice cream. It was wildly decadent and irresponsibly delicious. The service is not awful but you can tell that the servers are still getting their feet wet. No worries though. The food was totes worth the wait. I'll be back no doubt and I'm pretty sure I'll be updating with 5 stars.",

They also have a rotating drink list that always seems to offer something new and unique.  They take reservations and it usually a good idea, especially on a weekend.

Why can't the 4th largest city in the US have a brewpub? I digress.There is a sterile and industrial atmosphere here. One that I am seeing in more in more bars, and I am not a fan. The style does not work here looks like the pub and owners are being cheep.  Seems cold to me. The bar is to the left with some tables and booths. To the right on the Neil St side is another dinning area. The brewing equipment can be seen from the Church St side. A few TV's above the bar, but unintrusive. Relaxed, but sterile and pretty much the exact opposite of the Blind Pig. Which oozes uniqueness from every wood poor.The service is fast, but they are not very interested in much. I want someone working at a brewpub to at least show interest in their products. Here it seems they want to shuffle you in and out with a ticket and some tips. Unimpressed on this front. The food is fairly bland and generic. Some pizzas, some steaks, some chicken, some seafood. A little of everything. They do nothing good, but nothing bad either.There is a wide variety of beers available. Including a cask mild, which I would have jumped at if I had seen it before leaving. The rest is about 14 taps in all styles. A blonde, hefeweizen, a scotch ale, a few stouts and IPAs (some imperial), lots of Belgian styles.  Though nothing is really that good, and some have obvious flaws.Overall, clearly the second best brewpub on the block. Almost the definition of average to me. The food does not really excite me either. I really can't see myself coming here to often over the many other great beer destinations and restaurants within walking distance. Though cheers for at least another brewpub option in town.",

I enjoyed, on separate occasions, the chipotle chicken sandwich (good sweet potato fries) and the grilled and stuffed. I also sampled my teammate's meat loaf; that tasted incredible as well. I loved my cocktails, which include the Vanilla and Mint, Dark and Stormy, and the Aztec Chocolate. The last one was amazing - it had a spicy kick to it. The atmosphere and service were incredible as well. If in town again I would make it a point to return here.",

My BF thinks that this is \"a great place for women who shop at Chicos to meet up with each other and discuss the braided leather belts they bought for their husbands.\"  Which is to say, he thinks they overdo atmosphere to keep the rif raff out.  In my experience, I will sacrifice dim lighting for a chile that is actually spicy.  Oh, midwestern restaurants.  Are you using bell peppers to make Chile Rellenos?  My littlest brother really liked it, though.  He devoured some friend bacon appetizer.",

For dinner I had the Swordfish dinner. It has a very nice and spicy glaze and is served on a bed of arugula and other spiced veggies. Very impressive, very tasty, but it was a little small which the server told me ahead of time. Not the best choice if you are looking for a big meal, but a very good dish overall. My friend had the Pork rib and pulled pork dish with cole slaw and potatoes. I was very good, had a nice kick to it. Everything is served with a modern flair and a unique flavor profile. This is not your typical boring brew pub food. Very stylish. The atmosphere is nicer that most brew pubs and is great for a nice dinner out with friends. I am never disappointed at Destihl!!",

Tons of good things to say about the place, but I'll start with the two negatives so we can get that out of the way.The waitress heard me say cheese pizza instead of goat cheese pizza.  Probably my fault actually, because it was loud and I am a self-proclaimed mumbler.  This mistake was fixed promptly and the pesto goat cheese pizza was awesome.  Second problem was that the fried asparagus was somewhat whelming.  It was really big, so if you're going for size great, but smaller spears aren't woody textured like the big spears.  I assume that since they specify they use local when they can, that this problem will remedy itself once asparagus comes into season in a few weeks around here.Now for the mega good stuff:Deadhead double red is probably THE BEST red ale I've ever had.  It is strong, spicy, flavorful and full bodied.  Just wonderful!  Everyone at my table liked their other flavors (and we went with some beer snobs ;)  The hubby loved, loved, loved the coffee glazed rib-eye.  Service was surprisingly good granted that it was the first weekend they were open.  The people getting bad service in the other review...sorry, we must've been hogging all the attention ;).  We actually liked the place so much we went back for brunch on the next day.  Which was even. more. amazing.Ordered the swordfish tacos (see pics) and Cuban sandwich, and the french toast (see pics) for the munchkin.  The kids French toast was ridiculously awesome.  Here's the most awesome kicker- we were with a big group with 4 kids and the back room was open, so they gave it to us to have our brunch back there so the kids wouldn't bother anyone else.  It was an awesome experience and the whole staff was soooo super nice.  Make sure to check out my food pics- the kids meal was 1/3 eaten when I took the pic, but you can imagine the thrill in junior's eyes when he saw what he got for breakfast! :)Awesome place guys!  Keep up the good work!",

Fortunately, I was able to get a reservation through OpenTable via Yelp, so getting in was no problem.When we arrived, we were seated within 30 seconds.  I appreciate that efficiency - we also saw several groups that tried the walk-in route - Lesson Learned - use the Yelp reservation system for fast seating!We ordered the home-made chips for an appetizer, and they were great.  Very tasty, and a malt vinegar sauce, as well as a spicy sauce.This place makes and serves it's own beer.  if you want a Bud Light, you'll have to go elsewhere.  If you want to try their beer, the prices are quite honestly, very low for good beer.  We tried their 4 ounce beers (I know, so small, but since you're trying a store brew, do I really want 16 ounces I don't like after one sip?) and for $1 and $1.50 (the price range of a 4 ounce beer), we got 2 beers that were very palatable and very good.On to dinner. The menu ranges from sandwiches to steaks to pizza.I ordered the 8 ounce Sirloin, medium rare.  The steak was cooked properly, more importantly, it was seasoned properly, and tasted great.  It was more tender than some fillets I have had recently.  A+!My wife ordered a pork roast dish, that had pork so tender you didn't need a knife.  She really liked the dish.My daughter went with the 8 ounce burger, and was very impressed.  She ordered it medium rare, and it was cooked to order.  She loved it.My son ordered one of the pizzas, and was a little surprised when a large, thin crust pizza arrived (pleasantly surprised - he was expecting a lot less.)  The pizza was great.We ordered desert, which included carrot cake (we ordered 1 piece for 2 people, and it was the right choice - very heavy, very good), along with S'mores and a Neopolitan fruit dish, all of which were very good.The only reason this isn't getting 5 stars is the noise level - the interior is nicely appointed, and very well done, but the acoustics are not very good.  Lots of hard surfaces result in a loud restaurant, where it was hard to hear our server.We'll be back.  The entire ticket with tip was less than $110 for four adults.",

I went it's opening weekend and let me be clear when I say this rating is based on beers alone, I didn't get a chance to try the food yet!I'll start by saying that the atmosphere is really cool. It reminds me of a Blind Pig Brewery meets Seven Saints or something like that. They call themselves a gastro-brewery instead of a gastro-pub, which I think fits the bill pretty well. The place is divided up nicely with the bar being it's own area and a nicer looking restaurant on the other side. I have to say though, I was a bit surprised to hear that it's only open until 11, that doesn't seem wise for an area of town that's so reliant on the nightlife.As far as the beer goes, they had 18 on tap that were freshly made on the spot and they were pretty amazing. I was surprised to hear that they didn't have anything but their own brews available, and I worried about how my non-fancy beer fans felt, but then when I tasted their Champaign Blonde Ale, it was EXACTLY like a Bud Light. I think my favorite that I sampled was the Downstate Pale Ale, and the Raspberry Wheat Ale was a bit too much for me. But overall, I think they covered their bases pretty well.I definitely can't wait to come back and try the food (which I hear is truuuuly delicious) and give this place it's 5th and final star!UPDATE!So I went back and finally got to try the food. I believe I ordered the Swordfish, my boyfriend got the jambalaya and we both split some of the beer battered asparagus. I'll say right away the asparagus was the best part, which didn't surprise me because everyone raved about their appetizers, but I never heard much about the main dishes. My swordfish wasn't that great, to be honest, and I'm pretty easy to please. My boyfriend's jambalaya wasn't superb either, but then again, that's probably not the best thing to order at a place like this.All in all, everything was good, and a nice change from what's available downtown, but if I had one piece of advice, it would be stick to the beer and small plates!",

                "review": "We've been to Destihl maybe six times now, for brunch, lunch, and dinner. Most of the food is very good, better conceived and made than a lot of other area restaurants offer. Portions are fairly generous (not so much with brunch items), and the price fits the quality of ingredients and preparation. The staffing is good, service is timely, and the decor is charming. The craft beers made on site are wonderful. Try a series of 4 ouncers to build your own tasting. The flavor profiles given on the brew menu seem so far to have been accurate.For appetizers, I recommend the shrimp ceviche (technically a \"small plate\") and the stone oven pretzels (you get two, with cheese and spicy honey mustard dips). I've tried one soup, the corn and chicken chowder, which was very good, nice SW pepper flavor without overwhelming the chicken. We've had sandwiches and entrees, from burgers to steak, and it's all been really delicious. The food is in the American Contemporary Casual style -- better than Houlihan's at the i-Hotel in our opinion.The only bad experience we've had with the food has been the cedar plank brie dessert. It was badly prepared (the brie wasn't even room temperature) and either the recipe was off or the honey-chili sauce was made incorrectly, because it was completely unbalanced and unpalatable. The smoke flavor reacted poorly with what was on the plank, too. We took the brie home (a big piece) and cut off the rind to eat the middle later, but it still tasted of rank sauce and smoke. We did not go back to the restaurant for a couple of months because of just how bad this was.  I wrote the general manager and he was good about it, offering to review the recipe and preparation with the lead chef. Since returning to Destihl, we've had good experiences again -- the place is consistent, a fun place to socialize, and a nice addition to CU's restaurant scene.",

It's not your typical quesadilla- it comes deconstructed and has components like bleu cheese and roasted garlic vinaigrette.  At the risk of sounding like a total weirdo, I have to confess that I have been thinking about this quesadilla A LOT and cannot wait to go back and have it again! :)The beer is good and the atmosphere is very modern and chill.

Not one of the entrees are even vegetarian (they have a few vegetarian burgers and such, however). They have exactly one vegan dish: vegetables cooked in cashew cream. That's all folks. The dish was distinctly unremarkable, but most of the menu appears that way (this applies to even the animal products dishes; Destihl is only good for a select few dishes: salmon, mac and cheese, and burgers). I also ordered potato croquettes because from the description, there's no cheese in it (the other descriptions listed cheese, so I mistakenly assumed that these were cheese-free). In fact, the potato croquettes do have cheese in them. Just a note.I can't give 5 stars to a restaurant that I don't personally enjoy. But I think if you like beer and American food, you'd like this place.Just a note: I received a Compliment from another Yelper who seems to have misinterpreted my review. I would never take stars off because a restaurant is not vegan friendly especially when it never claimed to be. If you read my review, you can see my comments on the taste of the food. I even specifically wrote that my criticisms applied to animal product dishes LOL! I have tried many, many dishes at Destihl, both vegan and non-vegan. Destihl is two stars because the food is poor, not because it's not vegan (I almost want to laugh writing this because I can't believe someone would actually gloss over my whole review just to leave me a negative comment. It's pretty funny how willfully thick people insist on being). Yes, at one point I hated Destihl but I grew to love it...but that was because I was settling and I was naive. After trying many other restaurants, my opinion is that Destihl, overall, is an average to below average restaurant that may appeal to some people. I write about both sides to help veg*ns make eating out choices. They are never reasons to take stars off. I even explicitly noted which meat and cheese dishes were good so that I could highlight the good stuff about Destihl. People are really funny. This Yelper also asked me why I don't just exclusively visit vegan restaurants (even if you're not vegan, I think you can see how funny this comment is). Cheers.",

Well, anything is possible it was a tarter beer but still a very light ale. They didn't have their dunkelweizen here which was disappointing. I got hungry waiting for my friend so I ordered the Ancho chips and dip. The chips were just okay but the vinegar and the dressings were really quite good. The habanero vinegar wasn't overpoweringly hot but had a nice kick and the ranch was more than just a ranch dressing. I had the bison burger because I haven't had bison meat in a while and it was just as good. The burger though, was all right the bison, slightly sweeter and less greasy than ground beef was good. The dressing on it though took away from the flavor of the meat  but the fries were actually quite tasty.  Overall, it's still an okay place",

You can tell just by looking at the extravagant descriptions on their menu. I give them credit for trying new things (hence the 2 stars instead of 1), but when it comes to food sometimes it's better to stick with something proven.",

The food is okay, I can't say that it is amazing or that I crave coming here for dinner. It is also not cheap by any imagination, but this is one of the hot spots for dinner with the gastropub concept and microbrewery on site. The first time I came during a work function. I had the bavarian style pretzel. Nothing really exciting. Pretzel with cheese sauce or the IPA mustard. It sort of reminded me of the pretzels you would get at the amusement park. I ended up trying the most expensive item on the menu which was the espresso rubber ribeye 18 oz with bone in, chiptole espress bbq sauce, asparagus, and bacon truffle mashed potatoes for 30 dollars. Somehow the meat just does not match steak hour quality meat. You are expecting an angus quality steak, but somehow my ribeye had a huge chunk of fat in the middle. Good ribeye is marbled with fat to give it that amazing tenderness and flavor, this was not that. The espresso rubbed gave it sort of a burnt flavor. I can't say that I was impressed. The second time I came went with the beer battered bacon egg burger 14.50 that had angus beef, beer battered jalapeno bacon, bacon jam, along with a fried egg topped with smoked white cheddar cheese and a brioche bun. Somehow the batter of the bacon was super thick so you ended up having chicken tender size bacon on top of the burger. The blend of angus beef patty with bacon jam and fried egg is an amazing combo, but somehow the oil must have not been changed for the beer batter bacon. It was a very dark color and had a strong not so pleasant oil taste. If you like gastro-pub food you can give this place a try, but once again for the price you pay the food just falls short of that bar.Pros: gastro-pub, lots of beer selection, quick serviceCons: not top quality protein, the oil may have not been changed for a while given the overused oil taste, expensiveHidden deals:Join the desthil guest reward program. I did not get offered this at my visit.You get 25 dollars back after spending 500 dollars. Double points at lunch time during the week.",

It is the only place in town with cheese curds!  I absolutely love the baked apple dessert! In the evenings, the sun is in just the right place to give a nice shade for the outdoor seating. All in all, I have always enjoyed my visits to Destihl.",

When we did not have a reservation we were simply turned away even though we could see tons of empty tables.Recently we left the game early and called them from the parking lot at 2:45 and made a reservation for 3:15. We were promptly escorted to a roomy booth which really worked out because other people ended up joining us. We had to wait for a while for the other people to show up and the staff was very amenable to it, acted like that was just fine. They even held back our entree order until they got there.We liked the deviled eggs for the appetizer, they were really good. I had the chili which was very disappointing, I wouldn't get it again. My wife and I split the Cubano sandwich which was Okay.Nice big space, great staff and if you have a reservation, great place.  But the food is kindof college town fare which the space is not. Too bad as last time we were here the food was better.",

I actually was so certain our waiter was an awkward engineer that I asked him if he was a student at U of I.  Imagine my surprise when he said he studied library sciences.

The dipping sauces that come with it, one cheddar cheese sauce and one honey mustard type sauce are both great too.The charred broccolini salad is delicious. I also recommend the herbivore burger if you like veggie burgers. It is huge though so be prepared to share with someone or take half home. The cedar plank salmon is also very good and comes with grilled vegetables and a nice arugula salad. The salad was a bit too overdressed for my taste so request it to be lightly dressed if you don't like a lot of dressing.As far as dessert goes I've tried the cherry bread pudding, s'mores, chocolate cake, and the wild sour berry tart and out of all of those I would recommend the tart and the chocolate cake. They give you a pound of chocolate cake so only order it if you are not already stuffed from your meal or if you want to take it home. Half of it was more than enough for 4 of us.",

If you get a chance, check out the weekend brunch. They have a killer strawberry french toast entree that is to die for. Prices are a little on the higher end, relative to a college student's budget but overall, not too expensive. Staff is friendly, accommodating, and fast.

The burger is bland and if you're lucky (note my sarcasm), you'll get a few nice, chewy chunks of fat in there. I got some kind of s'mores dessert and it was a cheap mess. How can you make a bad s'mores dessert??? It's cruel! Their menu is so awesome, but they're SUCH a tease! They cannot execute anything well. I gave them two stars: one, for the selection in the menu and the other, because I haven't had any beer here and it is kind of a brewery I guess so I can't judge them there. Also, people seem to like their deep-fried bacon, but I personally cannot bring myself to put something like that in my body, but then again I did eat at Destihl TWICE *facepalm*Oh, Destihl.

My husband and I have been here a few times, and we both really like the potato croquettes (mmm, chimichurri) and the marinated cucumber salad. Both have a spicy bite -- definitely recommended. The rest of the food is okay. Pizzas are decent, the salads seem to rely a lot on the dressings, similarly so with the sandwiches. Service is good and friendly, although can come down a little on the overwhelmingly chatty side. Still, in a place as big as this one, it's nice to not feel like you've gotten lost or abandoned.Unfortunately, I can't recommend much else. The design and marketing of Destihl gives off a very artisanal vibe, particularly in their choice of \"craft beer,\" but their beers are at best uneven and at worst anemic shadows of what they could be. Most recently, I was disappointed in the pumpkin porter, which sounds like it should be layered and spicy and complex. Mostly, it was bitter and I could only taste the pumpkin if I really thought about it. I've felt similarly about all of their beers that I have tried, although a few are okay (the Hefeweizen, the Tripel). I want to be seduced by the delicious descriptions (and oh, they DO have a good writer), but I just can't.This place reads to me as a large chain that wants to be a small, careful, art-and-ingredient-driven restaurant, but it doesn't get there. It's confusing. 2 1/2 stars, rounding down.",

I had very hard time deciding on what to order on my two visits here. Be careful when they ask what kind of salad you want when you order - because they're going to charge you ~$8 for it if you bite. The food has been sensational, but they tend to overseason some dishes. Several people in our party ordered Caesar salads (which is half a head of romaine topped with a fried egg) and they were grossly over peppered. The pulled pork from my Carolina pork two ways was the spiciest pulled pork I've ever tasted in my life, so much so that I couldn't take more than two bites in a row. It wasn't a problem ubiquitous throughout our group or between visits, though.The atmosphere is very nice. It's dark and clean. The service has always been good.",

Got a pizza this time, which was pleasantly adequate for a one person dinner. It was thin and crispy, but not crunchy...just the way I like it! We sat at a window near the bar and watched downtown during sunset, which was really nice.

We were impressed with ALL of it.  Flat bread was good if you're in the mood for starchy foods--the pizza had a very thin crust, which I loved, so you could eat more of the toppings...and the salad was HUGE for its small price.We tasted several of the beers and ended up getting a growler to go because we loved it so much.Decor was a bit industrial, and very contemporary, especially for the Midwest.

I asked to see the manager waited another ten minutes so got up and left.  Only as I was walking out the door was the manager able to find me.",

Honestly, my biggest pet peeve with Destihl is their attempt at trying to create elevated food that just come off as tacky. For instance when I split their quesadilla appetizer they proudly touted it was deconstructed. That meant the appetizer consisted of some tortillas with melted cheese and a side of so-so grilled steak. Give me a break- I've had some cleverly deconstructed items before and that was not the case here. They do a similar thing with smores (e.g. the marshmallows come pre-melted). Tacky might be a strong word but to serve things in ways that are poorly executed and actually make eating your meal less enjoyable and more complicated in an attempt to seem high-end is pretty tacky.",

I personally love the beer-battered asparagus and beer-battered fish and chips. My husband has ordered the fish tacos on one occasion and pizza on another. The fish tacos were okay. The pizza is good. They also have a gluten-free menu and a kids' menu. Even though we have never taken our 2.5 year old to a kids' restaurant, and she is used to dining with grown-ups in grown-up restaurants, it's nice that they accommodate young diners with crayons to color on the kids' menu. Even the most patient young foodie could use a quiet distraction while they wait. Glad we have this restaurant in the C-U. I highly recommend it.",

It took less than 5 minutes to get seated and less than 10 minutes to have our order taken. Within 2 minutes of having our order taken, the soup we ordered came out. The main entree came out in a timely fashion as well.Items I ordered were:Three Cheese & Ale SoupStuffed Poblano PepperCajun-Style Shrimp Po' BoyThe soup was overall very delicious. It was a bit salty but the creamy consistency was amazing and the bacon and green onions really gave the dish some nice texture and crunch. The soup also had a slight bitterness which was good as well. I highly recommend this dish. The stuffed pepper had great flavor but lacked texture. The potato and cheese filling was a bit mushy and the pepper being mushy as well didn't help. I wish the pepper had a bit more crunchy texture to accompany the creaminess of the potato and cheese. The sauce was great and had a nice flavor with some heat. The rice and corn was delicious as well. I probably wouldn't recommend this dish. The po' boy was pretty good. The bread was toasted well and gave the sandwich a nice crunch. Shrimp was a bit overcooked and the veggies were kind of just slammed together in some sauce. However, flavor was there. I took a risk in ordering a Louisiana style dish here and it didn't really hit the mark. I would still recommend this dish nonetheless. I was going to give this place 3 stars but the service is what made this place shine. Therefore, 4 stars it is! Overall, not a bad experience and would come back.",

There was not much of the cheese sauce that was supposed to be on the sandwich, either.  Did it taste good?  Sure, when I managed to get a bite that actually had all the ingredients of the sandwich in it.  Also, the top piece of bread was hard, probably because it'd been under the warmer for a while.I feel like they charge high prices for mediocre food; I do like having a spendy meal every now and then, but Destihl is not where I would go when I do.",

It was fairly fast service as well for being as many of us as there were.  I liked the menu selection here to.  Lots of gourmet and different food items to choose from, not the same old stuff you see at most restaurants.  They have a unique twist to your average or popular dishes.  Pretty cool.Now on to the food.... They had me at beer battered jalapeo bacon! Omg it was delicious! We also tried the beer battered asparagus which was equally as good.  For my meal I got the green chile mac and cheese with pork.  It was good, I wish I would've ordered something with a bit more substance (not much meat in it) but I guess that was my own fault! The flavor of what I had was great though.  I also tried my moms stuffed pablano pepper which was great! I wish I would've gotten that.  Everyone seemed to love their food here.  Oh, and the carrot cake is TO DIE FOR! I highly recommend it, the pieces are as big, if not bigger, than my head! The prices were also fair.  I really enjoyed this place!

They're also a brewery, if you're into that sort of thing, and my experience has been that the waitstaff are very helpful and knowledgeable when it comes to the stuff on tap.So if you like the idea of a flight of carefully-selected brews and tasty (if not slightly overpriced) appetizers appeals, stop by.Don't bother with sitting down for dinner. I've limped out of dinner here maybe five times in the past several years. Some reviewers described the food as 'delicious' (they are wrong); a few others as 'inconsistent' or 'not great' (correct). As a purveyor of hastily-prepared American slow food, Destihl is unremarkable, and the breadth of their menu probably suffices to describe the care that each dish has received. Some dishes are actually quite nice, if still too expensive, but you're unlikely to know which are worth your time unless you've got a secret decoder ring or something.If you're looking to blow some cash on food downtown, think about what kind of food you really want. You're likely to get the same (or a similar) dish done better somewhere else. It's like a rich man's Applebees -- the food is better dressed and the ambience is less \"shopping mall,\" but your wallet hurts more than it should and your tongue is left just as wanting.Oh, and if you ignore the rest of my advice, don't ignore this: don't get the big chocolate cake for dessert. It is the most over-sized lump of grocery store crap I've ever tasted. Its spot on the dessert menu is downright insulting.",

We ordered the cheese curds to share (nothing great) and I had the Chimi Chicken Torta; which was actually pretty bland. The second time I went, I ordered the Tomato and Bread salad with chicken. By the name of the salad, you would think it would have tomatoes on it right? I had two little pieces of a tomato, wilted greens, and a couple little tiny balls of mozzarella. Not acceptable. I asked the waitress for more tomatoes and mozzarella and after looking annoyed, she returned with more of each. I don't know what others are having that's so great, but I am very unimpressed with this place and will not be returning.",

I had dijon chicken the last time I was there and it was burnt and over cooked but the sides were underdone. My boyfriend got a steak which came out a bit too rare and was just a bad cut- riddled with lines of fat. On a previous visit I had fish dish that was so over-seasoned with peppercorn I could hardly eat it. I know several people who swear by their food but it seems to be inconsistent at best.",

His only complaint was there could've been more fish in the taco.  I had the jambalaya.  A perfect combination of spice with a generous mix of sausage and shrimp.  The corn muffin was moist and flavorful.Recommend reservation for a Friday or Saturday night.",

We had the potato croquettes as the appetizer, and they were amazing!!  I had a soup and half sandwich for lunch.  The soup was the corn & chicken chowder.  Now, normally I am not a fan of any type of corn chowder, but it sounded good that day, and so I gave it a whirl.  DELICIOUS!!  The sandwich was the pastrami reuben, and every bite of it was amazing.  My only regret is that we didn't save room for dessert!  We're dining there today, and I'll be saving room for dessert.  If it turns out to be as good as my meal was the other day, I'll change this to a 5 star review.",

It has become the go-to place whenever my parents visit (I am in law school).The first time we went there, I was pleasantly surprised to see how many options were available for myself because I am an ovo-lacto vegetarian.  Usually I have to settle for something bland or uninteresting, but Destihl has lots of imaginative and delicious options.  We started with the beer-battered asparagus which was pretty tasty.  I ordered the stuffed pablano which was absolutely amazing.  It was spicy and had a really interesting mix of flavors.  My mom got the Thai fried chicken and my dad got the ribeye, which they both loved.  My boyfriend got the bison burger which he thought was good but not as amazing as our dishes.  The second time we went was for lunch.  I got the lunch combo with the portabella and brie sandwich and the beer and cheddar soup.  The sandwich was yummy but the soup was really very delicious.  Definitely comfort food and really hit the spot.  My mom got the Thai fried chicken again and my dad got the Thai steak which he said was even better than the ribeye.  My boyfriend ordered the Dijon chicken which he really enjoyed.You should probably make a reservation for dinner but likely do not need one for lunch.  They also serve brunch on the weekends until 2:00 and those items looked pretty delicious as well.  We have had great servers at Destihl and the restaurant has a nice ambiance.  Plus, they don't have a corkage fee!  The first time we went, we brought our own bottle of wine and there was no charge!  All in all we have had really great meals here and will definitely be returning!",

The ambiance was nice, and it was quiet enough to make it easy to talk with the rest of the table, even though a world series game was on and it was pretty crowded. The food was just mediocre. The fries (which were recommended as a side) were tasty, but a bit soggy. I had a chicken sandwich that was tasty, but the amount of meat was pretty small - it was a thin cut (probably half a breast pounded flat) and I ended up peeling away half the bun, which was twice as big as the cut.My friends seemed to like their food (burger, bacon-wrapped dates), but I don't think they would give it more than 2.5 or 3 stars either. I gave it 3 stars because the prices were OK, but I'm used to California prices - so this might be more the norm for Champaign.",

A brew-pub has to have great beer-cheese soup, right?  WRONG!!!!  The soup was like a creamy caraway broth with some green onion garnish.  No taste of cheese or beer, just gross.  The Pastrami Reuben, described as served on Cranberry Nut bread, looked interesting on the menu.  However, what I received was essentially a large cranberry nut scone (about 4\" tall) sliced in half with three small pieces of pastrami, a few shreds of sauerkraut, and invisible swiss cheese.  I normally do not send things back in a restaurant, but this showing was so horrible, I sent it back.  I tried the $13 American Kobe burger instead.  Eh.  It was an average - but by no means worth $13 - burger (think akin to the pre-made patties you find at Sam's Club) and, once again, the bread-to-meat ratio was WAY off.   Anyway, $40 later, we walked out very disappointed.  I can think of several places in town I could go and spend much less for a much higher quality experience.",

Our waitress was very helpful and friendly.I was happy to see that they have the same menu as the one in Bloomington-Normal with only their beer selection being different.  We started with the Beer Battered Asparagus which was delicious!  I was tempted to get my usual, the White Cheddar Stuffed Poblano Peppers but decided to change it up a bit.  I went with the Potato Crusted Rainbow Trout.  It had wonderful flavor!  My co-worker got my usual and she loved them too.  We decided to go for dessert as well.  I ordered the Creme Brulee.  I was not very impressed by this.  It was a bit on the runny side and I am used to creme brulee being smooth and creamy.Overall, great food and service!  Love this place!",

It was a MUCH bigger place than I anticipated, and I would love to see it on a day when it was busy. We were there about 3pm on a Monday. I was immediately impressed with the vibe of the place - very hip, and something you would expect to find in any major city's downtown. The beer list was posted on a board above the bar and was HUGE for a local microbrewery. Where I expected to find 8-10 local beers supported by a smattering of other regional brews, the list of beers brewed in house was closer to 20-25. As I had never been to Destihl, I asked the bartender to select 4 beers for me to sample (this is typical practice for me -- a good bartender will ask the right questions and figure out what you like). He started by asking if I wanted darker or lighter beer, and then asked me about some different flavor profiles.  After a few questions, he came back with four delicious beers.  I tried the Roadblock British Red Ale, Black Angel Stout, Deadhead Double Red, and Antiquity Rye Wine.  All were really awesome.I was very pleased with the bartenders knowledge of the beer, the fast friendly service, and the atmosphere in general.Next time I'm in town this is DEFINITELY a place I plan to return, and hopefully next time I'll get to order some food as well.",

                "review": "Couldn't be better for lunch. Service was on point and friendly (word on the street is they hijacked 80% of Houlihan's staff). Their beers were solid, too. I couldn't get the Yelp App to check me in so I could upload my pic of the tastiest stout I've ever had, so you are just going to have to trust me on its delicousity. I tried a taster (4oz for $1.50) of their berry weiss beer and it was a little too much berry for me, but if you like that kind of thing, you will love Destihl's take on it: the flavors of sweet and tart bounce back and forth dynamically as you sip. A companion loved their IPA, lauding the freshness and the spicyness of the hops.The food is as good as anywhere else downtown. My table ordered the portabello sandwich which was really hearty and came with kettle chips with a touch of seasoning and Destihl's Kobe burger, which is served on a fancy bun I did non recognize and stacked with thick jalepeno bacon, bleu and white chedar cheeses, pickles, and comes with the best steak fries I've ever tasted. That burger is about the same price as Farren's and the verdict was it was just as good, if not better, owing to the extra special toppings. Destihl's fries are thick badasses with the skin on and huge flecks of kosher or sea salt and were both perfectly crispy and cooked the whole way thru. Those are served with their balsamic vinegar (and expresso bean?) barbecue sauce that is unlike any I've ever had. As good as the kettle chips are, I highly recommend you sub in for the steak fries (though I saw some gorgeous piles of sexy shoestring fries served with other dishes, giving me one more reason for a quick return).Another reason for a quick return is the very impressive menu. Vegetarian will have no problem here, nor will the health-concious. They have a wide and deep menu spanning from American classic pub fare to trendy fusion dishes usually found only in more expensive restaurants. Prices were not exceedingly low, however value is good. I did not see their spirits or wine menus, but the lineup behind the bar bodes well for those not in the mood for beer.This place takes the best of Boltini's, Seven Saints, the Pigs, Radio, and Bacaro and serves it up in a killer setting with great  modern ambiance. I will never pass up an invite to eat here.",

The salad was good, which is maybe not what you'd expect from a place that labels itself a brew pub.  The pizza's a little boring, but that's probably just the vegetarian ones I'm limited to.  They serve continuously, they have a large cocktail list, they take my American Express... it's everything a burgeoning yuppie alcoholic could want in a brew pub.Except that's not really me so here's what I don't like.The atmosphere.  As I read through the descriptions they say \"oh the atmosphere is great!\" and I say... are you at the same restaurant?  It's what a corporate design team thinks of as good atmosphere.  Large, airy, and completely devoid of personality.  It matches Jim Gould's across the street very well actually.The whole place really just reeks of chain, and I don't think that bothers most people at all but if I want to go in by myself and have a late lunch I feel very awkward.  I'm happy to go in with friends and have cocktails and split a pound of cake.

                "review": "Despite the lack of love for Destihl on Yelp, I have to say: I am besotted.besotted/bistid/ - Adjective: 1. Strongly infatuated: \"he became besotted with his best friend's sister\".2. Intoxicated; drunk.Now, I am currently the first definition of besotted, with Destihl. I LOVED my visit. I went with Mr. Husband and a Very Close Friend (VCF) before seeing a movie at the Art Theater. Upon leaving, I may have been the second definition of besotted. (Just kidding, I only had one beer. I swear, my Yelp reviews make me sound like an alcoholic sometimes.)We went on a Monday evening around 6. We were seated right away. Mr. Husband and I had never been there, and we were surprised how big the restaurant actually is - it doesn't look that big from the outside. Our waiter came over right away and gave us a nice little menu introduction. I don't know why they've made a restaurant based on the things I personally like, but they did - I wanted EVERYTHING on the menu. Seriously. I haven't had such a hard time deciding on what to order for quite some time. VCF and I decided to split a small plate and an appetizer, so we got the 'House Olives' and the Bacon, Egg & Cheese deviled eggs. For my meal, I got the beer & cheddar soup and the spinach salad. VCF got the bison burger, and Mr. Husband got a special item, a bacon cheeseburger with sweet potato fries.Food: Very good, but to be honest, it *could* have been better. If Yelp let me give 4.5 stars, I would've. Everything was solid, but there were a couple things that might just push it over the top. For instance, the house olives small plate? It was agreed that it could be improved by serving the olives pre-chopped, not whole - sort of a mix between an olive salad and a tapenade. The deviled eggs were good, but the yolk was just a bit stiffer than I would've liked. The beer & cheddar soup was yum, but the scallions would have been a little better more finely sliced. The spinach salad was good, but the maple in the maple jalapeno bacon dressing was a little too sweet, and overpowered the other good stuff (grilled portabella mushroom? hell yes.) Another reason I'm torn: I love that they use ingredients from local places when possible, and have put an emphasis on sustainable farming. I'm all for buying locally and supporting small farms and businesses. On the other hand, the way it's flaunted just strikes me as a tad pretentious. Personal bias, but still.Service - Another ALMOST 5 stars. My only issue with our waiter was that he was TOO attentive. Really friendly, very knowledgeable about the menu, gave good recommendations, was able to tell us what HIS favorites are (it drives me crazy when waiters have no idea what's good on the menu.) However, he came by every 5 minutes or so. I always have mixed feelings about that. I like a server who is *there* when I need a water refill or a new fork, etc, but coming by too often just breaks up the conversation. Ambiance - Very cool. Very big-city. I like it. I also like that it's BIG. Ample room between tables. We chose a booth, and it was perfect. The noise level is ideal - quiet enough to talk at a normal level, loud enough that it doesn't feel like everyone in the area can hear what you're saying. Dessert - I can't tell you the last time I ordered dessert after dinner! That NEVER happens! (I actually can tell you, it was at my mom-in-law's birthday dinner in early October.) But VCF knows how to sweet-talk me into sweets (heh), and our waiter was VERY convincing when telling us about the stout ice cream sandwiches, which feature a housemade chocolate ice cream made with their own stout, served on chocolate brownies. Oh. Mah. Gah. SO GOOD. The stout ice cream was phenomenal. The dessert consists of two sandwiches, so you get four brownies and two scoops of ice cream. This would be great to  5 out of 5 stars for the dessert!! Price - Another 5 out of 5 stars. I was expecting that I'd have one entree and a beer. We ended up with a ton of food! For $38.77 before tip (I saved my receipt!), we got: -A soda-A 12 oz. beer - the Malius Apple Blonde Ale - so good!-House Olives app-Spinach salad-Soup-Bacon cheeseburger special-1/2 of the stout ice cream sandwichesSo while I can't yet give Destihl a 'best of the best' rating, I'm definitely a fan, and certainly willing to give it another few tries. I don't want to deter anyone from going here, because my visit was truly enjoyable. I'm already planning to permanently take Jim Gould out of my date-night lineup and replace it with Destihl. I just want to acknowledge that there is some room for improvement. I think with a tiny bit of tweaking, Destihl could easily be one of the top restaurants in C-U.",

There are always some really interesting flavors going on and Destihl really does distinguish itself above its competitors, the other sort of new american or gastropub restaurants.Destihl does brew its own beer and it's generally pretty good, always a very reasonable price. You can also get growlers for like $20. Great deal. They generally have one of each type of brew and they're generally pretty solid brews. I got the Bela - Imperial Pilsner - which was great. Good, strong beer but very drinkable.This time I started with the Corn & Chicken chowder which has a bit of chipotle espresso BBQ sauce on top. Wonderful flavors, really was. Very delicate corn flavor mixed with the hint of bbq and given some weight from the just marginally creamy chowder. The soup was nothing short of phenomenal. Must Have.I then had the Farm & Field burger. Really interesting combination of flavors between the lamb and the bison within the patty and then it's topped with just a wonderful combination of delicious ingredients. Who would've thought that combining pesto, sun dried tomato aioli, havarti cheese, soy onions, etc on a burger would produce such an intriguing concoction of flavors!! My bun did come out quite burnt, but the rest of the burger made up for it.I'd get it again in a heartbeat.Only downside, no room for dessert.Can't wait to go back.",

The croquettes were run-of-the-mill, but good nonetheless.  The bacon was interesting, but certainly not a taste sensation.The main course were pretty variable.  My wife ordered the shrimp and grits - which was far too overpriced for such a meager portion.  Though, it was fairly tasty.  I ordered a Brewmaster's pizza which was very good.The main reason Destihl loses a star is the speed with which we received our drinks order.  It must have taken about 15 minutes after ordering for us to receive our drinks.  Eventually, we were informed of the backup at the bar.  I expect better though.Also, unrelated to my rating, there appeared to be a large number of employees standing around at the greeting station watching other employees working.  This could be training, then again, it could be the reason some of the food items are so expensive for the product!",

                "review": "If there were an option for negative stars, DESTIHL Champaign would have a rating of -5 stars.  What a complete failure this restaurant is.  This place reminds me too much of the Jim Gould success failure story.  It's a tale of how a restaurant owner and chef become to sure of themselves and stop trying only to discover complete failure.  I pride myself in knowing good food and good restaurants.  I have studied cullinary technique and have a passion for fresh, quality ingredients that produces a meal that leaves you longing for more.  I write this review, having visited DESTIHL three times spread out over the course of a year.  I sent my food back two out of the three times.  The second time, I ordered the veggie burger which was hands down the WORST veggie burger I've ever sampled.  I did not send this back because it was not the way the burger was cooked, it was a pure and simple failure on the design.  My first experience I ordered swordfish.  It was overcooked, returned and cooked perfectly.  My husband ordered the Bison burger, medium rare and it came out well done.  While waiting for the food to return, the manager apologized and brought us free appetizers.  The meal ticket was reduced due to the error in the kitchen.  I was optimistic about this restaurant and the situation was handled perfectly.Last night, I returned for what I was hoping to be a perfect swordfish.  My husband's and I's order was the same.  Bison burger and swordfish.  First try at our order lended the same results.  Both dishes overcooked and returned.  Second try at our order, my husbands burger was cooked perfectly, my swordfish was raw.  Third try at the swordfish, still raw!  I changed my order to salmon at the waiter's recommendation.  Finally a manager appears and delivers the Salmon stating \"this is cooked to the chef's perfection.\"  The manager slither's off like a snake before I even touch the salmon.  Without cutting into the salmon, It was obvious that this fish was too raw.  My family had finished eating and after an hour and a half wait with no food, no appetizers, and a chef that I was now convinced can not cook at all, I ordered a Greek Salad.  This salad looked like someone threw the ingredients on my plate.  No order, presentation was horrible.  The dressing was red oil.  This dressing did not taste like greek dressing at all.  I ate the salad in disbelief that this place can not even prepare a good salad.  Our ticket was once again adjusted but this experience left a sour taste in my mouth.  I e-mailed the general manager and COO for the company and am awaiting a reply.  I would recommend no one go to this restaurant.  Seated across the street is Ko Fusion, an amazing restaurant.  This restaurant is too close for comfort for DESTIHL as this is where I will be seated watching DESTIHL's doors close for good if they do not find a chef that can cook the menu that was created.EDIT:  Less than 12 hours after my e-mail, I received a phone call from the general manager.  He was very kind and appologized.  More than this he listened.  He was kind and acknowledged that my concerns were valid.  He stated over and over again that there are no good excuses.  Humiliy allows for growth and I hope that this general managers humility induces change that produces solid growth.In March 2013, My husband and I used compensation cards to return.  The following is my email to the manager of destihl.I e-mailed back in October regarding a disappointing dinner and service that my family I experienced at Destihl Champaign.  We received compensation cards and returned tonight in order to assess if the service and food improved.  Our server was once again phenomenal, but the food was less than stellar.  My husband and I both ordered the swordfish, which were once again not cooked properly.  The swordfish were dry and over cooked, even upon reorder.  I guessed by the drying of the fish that a meat thermometer was used to assess if they were cooked properly, which in my opinion is an amateur error.  I then ordered a small portion Greek salad due to my hunger, my husband did not order one and we were charged for both.  I then ordered a gluten free Mediterranean pizza and my husband, a bone in ribeye.  My pizza could not possibly have been gluten free because within seconds, I felt sick and bloated and my husband's ribeye was cooked unevenly and dried out!  Most likely another piece of meat fallen victim to the meat thermometer.  With a history in restaurant service and cooking, I was appalled that we were charged for the salads and the pizza and were virtually comped nothing for the less than stellar food that we received.  Please do not send us any more compensation cards as we will not be returning, but I wanted to let you know that we are completely dissatisfied with ALL of our experiences at Destihl Champaign.",

The dessert menu is also fantastic- try the chocolate cake that's the size of your head if you're looking for diabetes. The Smores plate is also fun.All that said, the food here is a bit more expensive than it's worth. Burgers are cheaper (and better) at Farren's, Radio Maria has better Cubans for the price and the entrees are nothing too impressive- good, but not great. I've also found service to be a bit hit or miss- we've had waiters that have been remarkably friendly and courteous, but last time they substituted a more expensive glass of wine for one they apparently didn't have without telling us. I like going here, and it's a nice change of pace every once in a while, but rarely do I go \"Boy, we need to go to Desthil.\"",

For my main course, I ordered the Brewmaster's Pizza, which was served with chicken, andouille sausage, ale onions, and an espresso-chipotle barbecue sauce. The pizza was nothing to rave about, but it probably would have been quite a bit better if a) the pizza had been served hot instead of lukewarm and rapidly cooling, and b) the crust had been cooked all the way through. My brother's pizza was also apparently cold and undercooked, and reading through the other reviews, this seems to be common for diners at Destihl who order pizza. I think I've probably accumulated enough evidence at this point--Destihl is not worth the high prices. There are so many better restaurants in Champaign.",

I enjoyed my food and drink, but since I was traveling, I just got a sampler of the Altercation (a good compromise between light and dark), and the spinach salad (enjoyed the maple bacon dressing) and the Cuban Pork.  Recommended stop in downtown Champaign - in the large condo tower on Neil in downtown.  There's a gigantic parking deck behind it, or metered parking in the city lot across the street, where there are 2 Zipcars stationed.  Good move, Champaign.",

My date ordered the dijon chicken and it was incredibly dry and also came with TWO HAIRS in it!  My kobe burger was also very dry and unexciting. The bun was stale and the beef was extremely dry and tasteless. For dessert we ordered  a large chocolate cake that was $11. It was okay, but nothing exciting.I'm not a food snob but for the money I would expect a lot more. Sorry to say that this was my first and last experience at Destihl.

In this case it's warranted because it's their own beer and they're responsible for the quality.  It was just a very thin beer, it didn't have enough flavor to stand up to the food.  I had their meatloaf dish, and I appreciate the idea of creating a blend of beef, bison, and lamb the loaf itself was over mixed and too dense.  The mashed potatoes seemed like they were made from a box, or they were over whipped, almost to a paste but there was enough butter to make them creamy.  The roasted vegetables were pretty good.  Ended with the bread pudding, which was a drier than I like, but the caramel sauce was good.

Best part?  Small (4oz) tasting portions $1-2.  GREAT service.-Every time I visit my parents in good ol' Chambana they have a \"new restaurant in town\" that hubby and I MUST try.  Or five.  This time, Destihl was first on their list... and they are so crazy about it, they took us twice.  In ONE DAY.First, for lunch.  No beer this visit (hence the second), just lunch.  I had the Portabella Sandwich with Shoestring Fries, and it was 100% delish.  Also on the table:- Stuffed poblano pepper- Cuban sandwich- Salad with ahi tuna- Clam chowder I heard nothing but raves from the group.Late that evening we stopped in for post-dinner drinks \"and maybe a little to munch on.\"  We got three appetizers for the table:- Chorizo & Potato Flautas- Marinated Cucumbers (there's some BITE to those suckers!)- Brewmaster's Pizza (yuuuuuumm)... and all got a few 4oz tasting pours.  The beer was fantastic, some of the best I've had.  Our waiters both times were friendly and went out of their way to make sure we had a good time.One of my favorite things about this restaurant is the story my dad told (more than once) about his friend's first visit.  They were a big group, 12 I think, and stopping in before seeing a show in downtown.  They ordered food, drinks, then dessert.  There was a delay in the kitchen and they were kept waiting on their dessert for quite while... they were now running short on time, so one of the guys flagged down their waiter and told him, maybe a touch rudely, that they \"needed either dessert or the check, because we gotta get out of here.\"  The manager came back a couple of minutes later, apologized profusely, and served their dessert.  Dessert or check, and Destihl chose dessert.  Their meal and drinks for 12 were on the house.It's those kinds of stories that spread your business' name in the best possible way - you chose wisely, Destihl.  The guy's been sending over everyone he knows, always prompting with \"you gotta hear how amazingly this restaurant treated me!\"",

I was mentally writing my review all throughout dinner, and it was a solid 4 stars--until the bill came. Don't get me wrong, I am happy to pay for amazing food, but it's gotta be spot-on. Our dinner for 2 was $120, after tip. We had 2 drinks each, an appetizer, two entrees, and a dessert. I've definitely paid this much before for a comparable amount of food, but that was at some of my favorite restaurants that make sure every detail is perfect. And everything at Destihl was good, but not perfect.Here's what we had:--Stuffed dates - These had a great sweet/salty/spicy balance, but the barbecue sauce was a bit too much and a little detracting.--Mustard-glazed chicken - The chicken itself was delicious, but there was too much mustard sauce. The fingerling potatoes and green beans were both good, but not well-seasoned. The dish also didn't come out super hot.--Espresso-rubbed steak - The steak was huge and cooked well, and it had great flavor. Not my favorite steak, but still good. --Bruleed banana pudding - They made this gluten-free for me by not having pie crust, and it was phenomenal. It was the star of the show! I am still dreaming of this.The interior of Destihl is very nice--what you'd expect at an upscale gastropub. Our server was also very nice, but he was a bit new and didn't quite know the menu well yet.While I'm not head over heals for this place, I do think it's a great addition to the downtown Champaign scene! I would definitely come back the next time I'm in the city... especially for that banana pudding.",

I finally came back a year or so later and the food has definitely gotten better.This time I went for lunch and had the swordfish tacos with rice and beans on the side.   This was pretty good.  Maybe just a bit heavy on the sauce which masked a lot of the fish but the chimichurri sauce itself was good.  My wife had the chimichurri shrimp pizza and hers was excellent!  I also have to mention the last time I was here I had the beer-brined double bone in pork chop and that was easily the best dish I had here.After a few early lackluster visits this place is slowly becoming one of the better restaurants in the area.",

Also, the fried green tomatoes appetizer with the crab/avocado salad on top. So delicious! Swordfish tacos were enjoyed.The bad: the bacon wrapped dates. The bacon wasn't crispy so it was tough to chew. The sauce was so spicy we were practically crying. Salmon sandwich special was not as good as anticipated, and the bacon on the bacon cheeseburger was also not crispy. The service was so-so. While our waiter at the beginning was friendly, he repeatedly forgot things so we would spend time sitting there staring at our food because we didn't have plates or silverware. They also ran out of wine glasses so we were left sitting through our entrees without drinks that were ordered before entrees arrived, and he didn't tell us until we were finished eating.Overall, it'd be worth a shot to visit again but if the 2nd experience was similar or worse, I wouldn't try a 3rd time.",

The waiter was fairly attentive,  but the food was BLAND. People often recommend this place,  and for the life of me,  I cannot figure out what the attraction is.

The menu is quite large and has a lot of variety from small tapas style plates, to salads, pizzas, burgers, steaks, entrees, and even some thai-fusion style dishes.  Because of the variety, I think this is a great place to bring a group or a date if you're not sure what type of food they prefer.  The beer is all brewed at Destihl and is decent, but I've never been blown away by any of their brews.  I have been here several times and my favorite dish so far was the Cedar Plank Salmon. On my most recent trip I ordered the Kobe Burger and when I ran out of sauce, the server asked if I would like more.   I am not a dessert person, but I LOVE their dessert menu.  So, do yourself a favor and save room for dessert!Be warned, if you sit in the bar area be prepared to wait. I have actually left a few times when I haven't been given water or a menu 15 minutes after arriving.  If you sit in the main dining room however, the service is superb.",

I have to say that I found it very amusing that the priciest restaurant I went to on this trip was also the worst meal of the trip by far.I ordered the goat-cheese pesto pizza, shared the battered asparagus appetizer, and had pint of the brown ale. The battered asparagus was alright but EXTREMELY greasy, the pizza was soggy and surprisingly didn't really taste like basil or goat cheese, and the brown ale was flat out bad (trust me, I drink a lot of microbrew beer, I know what good beer tastes like). Plus, most other people at my table agreed that their food and drinks were also mediocre. Needless to say, since this is an pricier restaurant, I doubt I'd be willing to give Destihl another shot.",

We shared the Beer Batter Asparagus for an appetizer and really enjoyed it (Trent encouraged us to squeeze the grilled lemon over the Asparagus and glad that we did).  We ordered the Lunch Combos.  The soup and sandwiches were top notch.   I know there are a lot of restaurants in the C/U area, but you can't go wrong here.

The steak was overcooked in chunks & there were only a few slices of steak. The dressing was sour & just OK. The rest of my family ordered the beer battered bacon app which they loved.

We also ordered an appetizer sampler that included fried asparagus, bacon deviled eggs and some kind of egg roll.

I actually altered my business travel plans to come to Destihl based on Yelp reviews, and am super glad I did. I drove through Illinois on a day trip and passed the Destihl sister location in Normal early in the morning before they had opened, so I decided to stay overnight in Champaign to visit the other Destihl location. I ordered the Red Chili Pork entree and it was, quite simply, remarkable. [note: I posted a tryptich Instagram photo of my dining experience here on Yelp] I also sampled several of their beer offerings, conveniently (and affordably) sold in 4 oz. taster glasses. All were more than satisfactory as compared to other microbreweries, of which I have been to many. The interior is also pleasant, being situated in a newly constructed building. There is outdoor seating, which was in high demand on the warm early evening I was here in late June. As one who travels a lot for work, I can strongly recommend this restaurant.",

A friend ordered the stuffed poblano, which was really nicely done, and ha some serious stuffing!The swordfish tacos are amazing; just look at the line up of flavours on the menu!I avoid eating pastas in most places, but the orrechhiette and fennel sausage one is great.

Great flavors and cooked the way we ordered.Best part is probably dessert. The smores are a fun, gooey mess and the cherry bread pudding was tasty.We dined on a Saturday night, which was also prom night in the area and a busy sports night (we were seated in the bar area), so it was a bit noisy.

Overall, I would never consider going back. I can find a better steak sandwich for a lot less at a number of different area restaurants. Coincidentally, I spoke to a friend about my experience weeks later when Destihl came up in conversation, only to find out that she had the exact situation happen to her when she visited Destihl. Her steak sandwich was extremely undercooked as well. Must be a common trend with this place. Just another common chain restaurant, as far as I'm concerned!",

I have never tried these and I thought that These were amazing. The perfect blend of spicy, savory and sweet. I got the Weissenheimer Chicken. I have to compliment the chef on how juicy the chicken was. It was a big piece of chicken and not one bit dry.

I liked that it was a personal pizza and they also offer gluten free bread. It's nice that this restaurant is conscious about that.The service was awesome too. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and attentive.I felt like some foods had a spicy twist on them which I think is a nice flavor to pair with IPAs.I didn't get to try any desserts because the kitchen closed.

The chicken on the other hand was far under spiced and seasoned. I will say their beer battered jalepeno bacon is delicious but deep fried food is pretty hard to screw up. Overall the prospect of having a modern american restaurant with an eclectic menu in the CU area is a great one, but a bit more attention to detail would greatly help Destihl.",

The decor is surprisingly upscale - really cool use of natural stone and wood. HUGE shame they didn't open with their patio ready to go, but when I inquired they said it was in the plans to open the patio soon.The beers (I tried 5, yup 5) were decent - not world-class, but decent. My favorite purely for summer drinkability was the Champaign Blonde, but I am admittedly not into dark beers at all, and there are PLENTY of dark ones and heavier Begian-style ales which I didn't try.The menu looked surprisingly interesting, (I was expecting burgers and pretzels), and between us we tried the pickled cucumber salad, the tuna carpaccio, the strawberry salad and the warm salmon and potato salad. All four dishes were winners, although the small plates ARE really small (which is exactly what we wanted). The entrees are MASSIVE for the price, and look like they are high quality meals, but I'm glad we saw how big they were before we ordered one!Service was excellent from beginning to end.The desserts also looks amazing, but I was too full to try. As a gay couple it was nice to feel comfortable and that there was a real mix of clientele - I was scared it was going to be exclusively Olive Garden-goers, but there were some hipsters, some queens, and some students as well as your typical 'casual-dining' crowd.Can't wait for the patio to open, but believe me, there will be a serious wait time on those tables - be prepared!",

I suggested we try Destihl after having a pretty good experience there with my family last time. This visit was equally as good!We opted to sit at the bar and watch the Bulls game due to the dining room wait being around 35 minutes which was much too long for two very hungry college kids.We started with a few 4oz beer samples which are very convenient and not too expensive, I dislike having to commit to a roughly $5 16oz beer not knowing much beforehand. I particularly enjoyed the oatmeal nitro but didn't much care for the Champaign blonde.The beer-battered bacon was a must-try for us since I didn't get it last time and it gets a lot of attention here on Yelp. We also opted for the cheese curds, both of these appetizers were so artery-cloggingly delicious.The Bulls started to seriously disappoint us and when our food arrived we were glad to have something else to focus on, rather than the demise of Chicago basketball this season. I ordered the meatloaf and my roommate got the rancher burger. He said his was really tasty, right up there with the burger we had at Farren's a few weaks earlier. I went with the meatloaf to try something different and when it came out I was initially a little taken aback, but after trying it that all changed. This was not your grandmother's meatloaf! It was rolled up and wrapped in prosciutto sitting on a mountain of mashed potatoes adorned with some thinly sliced vegetables all inside a cast iron skillet. The meatloaf itself was well seasoned and actually had a little spice to it. What really made this dish though was the prosciutto, it added that nice smoky pork flavor to the meatloaf. I highly recommend this dish!The service was a little different because we were at the bar. The bar staff was extremely busy due to having a packed dining room and fairly full bar as well. There were about two people taking care of us and they made sure we always had beer and were quick to clear our plates as well as check in frequently. Service: great!Overall, another great experience at Destihl. Though, like I mentioned last time, it comes a bit of a steeper price than some other potential options nearby. Either way, we really liked our food.",

The decor looks like the contractor went to Lowe's or Home Depot and bought all the \"fancy\" materials from the discontinued materials section (and just a note here to the management: really?  bathroom stall doors that go all the way to the floor?  Western civilization pivots on the ability to look down and see if there are feet under the door and thus realize that you have to wait a minute instead of jiggling the door handle like some pee-filled serial killer).  The service was equally uninspired -- my least favorite combination of ingratiatingly peppy and incompetent, and the food was mediocre when it got there. It took so long to appear at the table that I was sort of hoping that the cook had sent out for it from another restaurant, but no such luck.  And I only thought this might be the case because the menu says that the kitchen likes to get food from local sources. This might be technically true -- they might like it -- but there's not much evidence that they actually do it.  I think I can honestly say that the last time I experienced this kind of ambience I was in an airport restaurant.",

                "review": "Honestly, I'm a little surprised that Destihl's Yelp rating isn't higher. Two of my friends and I wandered in on a weekday night while looking for a place to eat at in downtown Champaign. The restaurant was relatively full for 7pm on Thursday, so I'd imagine there may be a wait on weekend nights. Beers = good. I think we tried 4? The strawberry blonde ale on tap was a clear favorite for us. Both their beer and dinner menus took awhile for us to look at. I was expecting traditional pub-style food, but their offerings far exceeded that.We started off with the deviled egg appetizer and the beer battered bacon appetizer. Both were very good- the beer battered bacon is a MUST. Jalapeno bacon in a tempura-like beer batter coating topped with a drizzle of maple chipotle glaze?! Yes please! When it came to our table, we slowly stopped talking and watched our plate of bacon descend in front of us. Like it came down straight from heaven. We didn't even realize we stopped talking and didn't remember what we were talking about until the bacon was gone..My friends got the jambalaya and the prosciutto-wrapped meatloaf. I really only tried part of the super tasty andouille sausage corn muffin that came with the jambalaya, as I was working on my full slab of beer-braised ribs (I gave one rib each to my friends to try though). They were perfect. Orders of magnitude better than Black Dog's ribs. I'm not sure whether or not that's a fair comparison since it's different cooking styles, but the texture of Destihl's ribs was absolutely perfect- tender, falling off the bone, but not annoyingly so.. The flavor was great also, as it tasted lovely by itself and did not need to be hidden behind sauce although the chipotle espresso bbq sauce it came with was also very tasty. My friends and I agreed that I \"won\" dinner since I ordered the best dish. My only qualm was that my shoestring fries were a little soggy and not as crispy as I would have preferred. But that's very minor.We were all pretty full, but could not pass up dessert. Like the rest of their menus, the dessert menu had a lot of tasty-sounding options. After some rock/paper/scissors, we ended up ordering the stout ice cream sandwiches which is more like four round brownie patties a la mode. But by all means, if you really wanted to, I guess you could try to eat it ice cream sandwich style. The alcohol in the chocolate stout ice cream wasn't very strong. Both the ice cream and the brownies were stellar. My friends especially loved the brownies. I was wondering what they did with the remaining brownie part after cutting out the rounds (to, you know, save waste if need be), and our waitress told us that the remainder is used for their chocolate martini? Maybe I'll check that out next time. Oh, and also, our waitress was very nice and friendly too. Overall, good service, clean place, nice decor.. everything was great. After tips, came out to ~$30/person, but actually filling up me + two guys  does require a bit of food and drink. I'm already trying to think of when I will return to try the kobe burger..",

This place is off the charts when it comes to liquor.  Just don't buy booze here.  That's my honest feedback.  We had a party of 8, once, and only a few drinks were ordered (a couple waters, two ordered pop) and the bill was something astronomical (like $180!).  The other thing about Destihl is that it's a microbrewery (and,-cough-, gastropub) that's trying to be a microbrewery and a -cough- gastropub, if you catch my drift?  If not, here's the thing-- it's pretentious as all get out.  And for who knows what reason, really.  It's kind of a dimly lit restaurant/bar that's just as non-descript as any other.  It tries too hard to be what it thinks it is, and doesn't try hard enough to be a good restaurant.With that said, though, some of their food is just out-of-the-ballpark, OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD awesome.  All of their soups (3 cheese and ale, or the tomato basil).  The Havarti and Turkey is lovely, as is the Cuban style pork (tho, I did find a very unappetizing piece of fat in it the very last time I had it, so it kind of put me off it for a while).You can't go wrong with a burger. =)  But, then again, it's a burger, they're not reinventing the airplane.I say... if you want to spend a mint for the possibility of some good food, and then an outrageous bar tab, pick Destihl.  But if you're looking for beer and semi-comparable food, check out Hooters or Buffalo Wild Wings. The same in theory, just a different point-of-view.",

My daughter who lives there is moving to Spain so we are letting her choose whenever we go down for football games and she has been picking some winners.This is a sleek, clean, modern space.  There are beer vats as you enter which add a nice vibe of authenticity.  We were seated right away at a very comfortable table for the four of us.  We tried the deviled eggs app and some gingery egg rolls, we all split them and liked them.  Both had a bit of a kick, the egg roll sauce had the most kick and I found this out after I had drizzled it all over mine but I still enjoyed it immensely, I just drank some extra water.Everyone tried a cup of soup because hey, soup is good food.  I gobbled up every bit of my beer cheese soup, so light and flavorful.  I loved it!  With my swordfish tacos I had an amazing iced tea, it was just a lovely flavorful tea with an orange slice.  The swordfish tacos were divine but if you are a bit of a spice wimp (like me) you might want the guac on the side, that is where the heat was for sure!  I ended up just eating the fish out of the taco, it was just too picante for me!  I adored the rice, bean, corn side dish.  Just delicious!For dessert, we all split a sour cherry bread pudding and I really liked it.  It came with ice cream and it was just smooth, sweet and a bit of tangy with that nice cold creamy spot of the ice cream.  I am not a huge bread pudding fan but I think I could become one!This was a very enjoyable meal.  The team had played lousy, my daughter is moving, I needed a culinary hug and this was it!  I would definitely come back but sadly it won't be with my youngest!  Why don't you meet us so I won't miss her?",

                "review": "I was really excited to try Destihl, but unfortunately the experience fell a little flat. My friend and I arrived a little after 7 on a Friday night and was told the wait would be about 40 minutes since we didn't have reservations. No problem. After only about 20-25 minutes our pager buzzed, so score! So far so good. Our server was really nice and attentive, nothing negative to say about him. However, the food is another story.We started with the cheese curds for an appetizer. And these were awesome, plus they give you a lot. The only part of the meal that really stood out, sadly. I'd had my eye on the strawberry goat cheese salad, so I got that and split the pesto goat cheese pizza. The salad had a lot of potential with all the seemingly good ingredients, but was just off. The spinach tasted wrong and it would have been much better with mixed greens. The \"strawberry\" part of the salad consisted of maybe three tiny pieces and the goat cheese wasn't even very good. It mainly was made up of mandarin oranges and ill-tasting spinach.I'm not a huge fan of wood-fired pizza (I prefer almost any other type of crust). My friend and I split a pizza, but I saw plenty of people putting one away all by themselves. It is very thin. The toppings were ok, but I didn't like how the goat cheese was in big globs instead of spread over the whole pizza.We left without getting dessert, but I saw a few and they are possibly the biggest desserts I've ever seen anywhere. This isn't a good thing. Probably 3-4 people should be splitting on dessert, but I'm guessing that doesn't happen that often. So just be aware if you do order that piece of cake.Besides the service, the other positive is the price. Everything is fairly cheap. But that coincides with the quality, so just beware.",

The price is really good, the portions generous, the grease level and everything is actually very low and the catfish and hush puppies are to die for. My mom, who ate the chicken, said it was very good too and we both enjoyed the coleslaw and fries as well. Overall, no complaints, only compliments to the owners and cooks here. I will be going back when I feel like fast, fried but high quality down to earth food.",

The wings are massive and meaty, dripping with the sauce of your choice (or on the side, if you prefer). The mild sauce isn't too hot, and has a hint of sweetness.I called my order in and walked out of the establishment in 15 minutes with a huge bag of wings! 10/10 will devour again.",

The fried chicken is pretty good and crispy as well. The desserts are cheap and pretty decent. The guy behind the counter has always been really friendly. All in all it's been a wonderful experience everytime.",

Tasty fish, a tad on the thin side though, covered in a cornmeal batter.  Everything was right about it.  I'd for sure come back when cravings for fried chick'n or fish overwhelm me.They have a decent list of sides, and since I somehow didn't notice fries came included in sandwich price; ordered the fried okra.  Yum!  Can't go wrong there.  Had enough leftover fries n' okra to share pre-dinner \"apps\" with some housemates.Prices here are super reasonable.  It seems mostly a take-out business, as there is very little seating.  It's a tad shabby 'round the edges, as a good you-buy-we-fry shop should be.  Counter guy super nice and friendly.",

A paper bag filled with a mess of fries and sandwich that are so greasy they leak right through, leaving a dark stain on the bag.When I came into JJ Fish the first time, I felt like I was back at home in Chicago.  The people inside waiting for their food were talkative and friendly, the guy behind the counter was a bit of a jokester with a sly smirk and a warmth to his demeanor.  The air was thick with fried chicken, fish, and grease.For $2.99, I got a freshly-cooked fish sandwich served up hot with cheese, tartar sauce, and a whole mess of fries.  The food was very tasty, but wasn't anything terribly special outside the context.  Given the price, though, and the fact that I got to have a humorous conversation with the cashier, it made it worth coming back a week later to do the same.  Later, I'd like to give the chicken a shot, since it seems to be what most everyone else in there orders.  They must know something I haven't yet discovered.A slice of local Chicago culture a hundred miles outside the city limits.",

He took a moment to get to us, but because he was obviously finishing making others food. He makes sure all of the food is fresh. Between the gyro and the fish sandwich, and our piles of fries, my friend and I were totally satisfied with our food.The place was clean. The proprietor obviously takes pride in his work. Highly recommend. Will return if in Champaign again.",

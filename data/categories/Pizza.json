My experience this time was much better than the first.I had a coupon for a free small appetizer. Our waitress told us that the amount could be used toward a large size appetizer, which was helpful.Service was very good. Our appetizer was the Cheesy Bread Florentine, which was very good. We followed with the Chopped Antipasto Salad, which was also very good. Our past dish was the Chicken and Sausage Zita, which was heavily spiced and a winner in our book. We had a few drinks which zoomed up the total bill.I was happy that the evening went so well. Although the food was much better this visit, I believe this chain is a tad too pricey for what you get. It would not rate nearly as high as a chain like The Old Spaghetti Factory for value.",

They were hand made and probably the best fried mozzarella I've ever eaten. However, it's $13.99 for 8 of them. That's double the price of most mozzarella appetizers and we could have eaten 2-3 orders of these. But it was delicious.So we ordered another appetizer - the mini meatballs. I was under the impression that they were stuffed with cheese but they weren't. They were pretty decent but we thought they tasted a little odd. We weren't crazy about them.  The portion was small and again, this tiny appetizer was also $13.99, which I find expensive for an appetizer.The house bread with oil and Parmesan was good and we ate a lot of bread. The servers were friendly but were never in a hurry. It wasn't busy at all but we had to wait 15 minutes to get our check once we were done eating. Most of the meal operated at that pace, which I find frustrating. I mean, if my drink is empty, please fill it up now, rather than 15 minutes later!Ok, so onto the main entree: we ordered chicken parmigiana. We ate the smaller order which had 3 big pieces of chicken and was about $20. It was good, although my wife and I weren't crazy about it because it had little onions all over as well as little tomato chunks all over (as opposed to a nice tomato-like sauce that other places typically serve).  All in all, food was pretty good, arguably much more authentic than other Italian places, and it was a good experience. I think this place can be amazing if you find the dishes you really prefer to eat. One other thing: I wanted the usual salad that I had ordered in the past from Bucas and was told by the server that they didn't carry it, although \"all the other Bucas carry it.\" I found that to be a little odd. Anyway, we will return but I'd like to see some improvements.",

I ordered a large for $32 so it was meant to serve 4 or more but it was 1.5 servings for me. There were 3 small stacks of eggplant. Maybe my senses of portion size is severely skewed? On another occasion, I ordered the large calamari for 2 people ($30, though meant for 4). It came out on a 6\" oval plate & was overcooked to little crisps. Totally not worth it. While some of the food is good, it is totally overpriced with small portions.",

The pasta is always al dente and tastes good. My children are in love with the fettuccine alfredo, but I think it's a little lackluster. I have tried the eggplant parmesan and it was far too chewy and tough to manage. The chicken dishes have always been pleasing and satisfying. Adult beverage selections are limited and pricey compared to other restaurants.Make sure you get the house bread with the balsamic/oil mix. That's the best part of the meal!",

I said, WOULD YOU LIKE A GLASS OF WATER?!\" Not only were we one placement may short, we had to repeatedly ask for silverware. I proceeded to order a Shirley temple, my classic go-to when I'm trying to lose weight. But alas, the sweet concoction came without a cherry. I tried to move past that, but I have to admit the rest of my meal was quite scarred from the experience. Onto the food. One should we warned that if one would like one's own meal, this is not the place to go. Almost everything is served family style. The six of us decided to order the Caprese Salad, Spicy Chicken Rigatoni, Baked Ziti, and Eggplant Parmesan. the Caprese salad was the most cleanly cut mozzarella I have ever seen. Bravo. As for the pasta, I cannot complain, however the seasonings could have been a bit more present. One of the most dissapointing parts of the meal was when we were given the check with no dessert menu. I didn't order the Shirley temple for nothing, sweet pea. I cannot complain, but next time, I could've used a cherry.",

I usually sit in the bar area and have noticed that other customers have the same experience. The waiters are pretty friendly, which makes up for your initial impression. I've experienced both attentive and not so attentive waiters, but again, overall pleasant customer service. Food is pretty satisfying. You get a good serving size and if you're not too hungry, you can save half of an entree for later. I've had their tomato,basil soup (yum!) and their ziti (double yum!) I definitely crave their ziti every time I go. My boyfriend has had their Spicy Chicken Rigatoni and Chicken Parmesan.  I always try a bit of his food and both of us agree, it's pretty freaking delicious. Only disappointment is their garlic bread (who screws up garlic bread?!) It's really dry and I'm used to really buttery garlic bread. I've also tried the mozzarella garlic bread, which is better, but not the best I've had. Again, I've only been at lunch so I'm not sure how it is when it's busier. You'll have a good experience though.",

One of the best things I have experienced is the celebratory dinning, another great aspect is the family style eating experience, and finally the atmosphere is true and authentic. We went here with a large party, and we all split a numerous amount of dishes. We had plenty of left overs, and all left satisfied. The entire staff was extremely grateful and helpful. We loved our service. Having family style options is great because everyone communicates about each dish and the party really stays lively. This establishment really nailed it when it comes to aesthetics. The restaurant really looks like an authentic Italian restaurant. Also, what a top end liquor selection. They had every wine imaginable and a full bar. We really like Buca and hope everyone makes a visit in. IT'S WORTH IT. Go in to Buca in Champaign for a great experience.",

But staff are usually friendly. For a place to get a chill dinner downtown, I'm a fan regardless of its shortcomings.",

The original location in downtown Champaign is a lot of fun, complete with a well-stocked bar, a few pool tables, and a CD juke box which all adds to the low-key atmosphere. My hubby and I went there on our first date and have been back many times since then.  It's not a dive bar, it's not super ritzy, it's always clean and to me, being there feels kind of like you've just gone over to your best friend's house to hang out for awhile.  It's never too loud, never too crazy, they have great service and they do a fantastic thin crust pizza.  My personal faves lie in a dead heat between their \"margherita\" and \"fajita\" pizza.  Though this isn't the only place to offer these selections, they blow away the competition.  Jup's isn't even in the same class with anyone else, it just is what it is (awesome) and I love that about the place.  They just get it perfect every time.",

To each their own I suppose, but quite frankly, it's probably my least favorite pizza around.  Pizza is way overpriced. A small personal 9\" pizza costs about $8, and I equate the taste to that of your microwaveable pizza bites. If you like pizza bites, well heck, then dig in. Their pizza to me is just like saltine crackers with mediocre sauce and stale cheese. Not only that, but food takes forever to come out.I get drug to this place with co-workers every now and then, and our small 9\" pizzas take 45 minutes to come out... That's ridiculous considering a pizza like this should cook in about 6 minutes.... On a plus note though, the servers are great and the atmosphere is nice, but ultimately I go out to eat for good food, and Jupiter's does not deliver.",

There is not a lot of sitting area if you come at peak hours.  So be warned.  Great billiard tables that go the length of this great old building, and people are serious about their pool here.  There is even a patio out back.  The building itself is ancient, and tons of character.The servers work hard, and are very friendly.  Though can get swamped during peak hours.  Just a couple of decent beers on tap.  Usually an offering from Bells, or Summit, and just recently I noticed Lagunitas.  The pizzas are great.  Crispy, thin crust that is awesome.  The specialty pizzas like Pizza Pesto is great.  Can't go wrong making your own as well.  They come in personal, 14\", and 16.\"  Always a good stop downtown for pizza, beer, and fun.",

My friend and I ordered 2 personal pizzas, the Pesto and the Buffalo chicken. The toppings were fine (buffalo chicken was pretty tasty), BUT the crust was terrible. Someone from Brooklyn a few reviews down has it spot on--tasted like a cracker. This not thin crust pizza. Any random pizzeria in NYC would have had infinitely better thin crust than what these pizzas had. This was cardboard crust pizza. I know this ain't exactly NYC, but for a 4-star joint, I had higher hopes. I would have given it 2 stars, but I added an extra one because it was open late night.",

She seemed annoyed I brought this up.  Check that bill, people.It's pretty loud, people are playing pool and I saw a man so drunk in the men's room, he was stumbling and slamming into the walls face-first.  So that's your atmosphere.I'd go back if I were looking for a late night bite, but there are probably better options out there.",

                "review": "I'm probably just a fatass but I think the pizzas are way, way, way too small for the price (about $10 for a 9-inch thin crust depending on the number of toppings you get). Especially since they don't have any specialty ingredients (though they do have a variety). Anyway there is nothing wrong flavor wise with the pizzas and I really appreciate how bone thin their crusts are (it's so hard to find crunchy crusts in Chambana). The atmosphere is also very nice. Relaxed. Mostly old people, townies. It's clean as well. But the pizza is much too small for the price. Maybe someone with a normal sized appetite can chime in.Update: I think I found out why I thought it was overpriced. I saw that the pizza was $7 on the menu (I just confirmed it). But was charged over $9. Why? I understand $7 is pre-tax but then, to be conservative, $9 flat would still go over the total. It's not a big difference but it's not acceptable to steal from customers, on purpose or accidentally. Here's the link to their menu with the prices: http://www.jupiterspizza.com/downtown/menu.htmlI got a custom 4-topping personal which should have been about $8 tops. Something that really bugs me about restaurants, as it should, is when they don't care what price they put on the menu and the servers will throw some extra on there because they're careless. Just not cool. Bombay Grill did this but their food is actually good enough that, fine, I'm okay with being stolen from-- take it as a tip. But Jupiter's food is not good enough to justify capricious pricing.",

While it might not sound like a great combination, this pizza was fantastic.  I expected skimpy or shredded salmon, but received fairly large pieces strewn across the pizza generously.  Drinks weren't expensive, and overall there was a good selection.  A $4.50 Lindeman's Framboise is about $1.50 cheaper than the equivalent size at the Blind Pig, if that gives you an idea of the pricing.  I can't wait to go again, fantastic pizza and reasonable drinks.",

I went to the other one back in my college days, but this one I didn't even know existed. Walked in and it's seat yourself tables to the left, a bunch of pool tables to the front, and a long bar in the middle. Very limited seating, but it wasn't packed at all so that wasn't a problem. There was a weird draft hitting our table though, so we moved to one deeper in the corner since we thought it was the door, but the draft was there too. We just had to wear our coats throughout dinner.For 6 people, we ordered 2 large pizzas, one buffalo chicken, and one prosciutto. I didn't care much for the prosciutto, but the buffalo was pretty bomb. Ordered some small ranches (50 cents per though, what a rip) and it was delicious. It's deceptive that they cut their pizzas into smaller squares because you feel like you can eat so much more. We had 6 slices left over and it was about 42-ish dollars with tax and tip. So a large probably feeds 4 people comfortably, 3 uncomfortably.Weird thing though is when we asked for a box, the waitress asked if we wanted anything else. We said no and assumed she would bring us the check. But didn't and we sat there for like 10 more minutes. Had to grab her attention and then ask for the check. We weren't drinking or anything so I'm not sure why she thought we would want to just hang out. Minor inconvenience though so it's whatever.",

A place where you can swap your favorite pizza toppings with friends, enjoy your go-to beer on the side, chat with friends, and watch the basketball game on their large TVs. They also have pool tables and arcade games. My favorite night to go is Tuesday because they have half off large pizzas and it's a popular night to go. Warning to Chicago-native-deep-dish lovers: these pizzas are thin-crust pizzas and I'm from St. Louis, so we love thin crust pizzas, but this place does not rip you off on toppings. Jupiter's specialty pizzas are great!  There's no need to stress about perfecting your pizzas toppings since they already have specialty pizzas with your already-favorite toppings. If you want to make your own crazy masterpiece, you can customize your pizza with four toppings maximum (meat toppings count as two). More importantly, the price is very reasonable. Also this place has a clean, friendly, fun atmosphere. It's definitely one of my favorite places to go in downtown champaign. I recommend every U of I student to check this place out with friends there before graduation .",

I have no idea what's good about this. Oh, doesn't Lunchables do a a pizza lunch? There you go, it's kind of like that.So, really what I'm saying is, I guess a lot of people like crunchy pizza, but if you're not one of those people, don't bother.",

I also love the atmosphere; I don't play pool, but the building is gorgeous (I'm a sucker for the tin roof) and the place is lively. The garlic bread isn't really worth it, and the beer selection is kind of lame (all the domestic Big Three bottles you can drink!), which keeps it from five stars, but I like Jupiter's a lot.",

The big-screen TVs are prevalent and made watching the game easy. There are plenty of billiards tables in the summer when the students are gone. The pizza however was only okay. Thin crust, w a passable amount of toppings but no discernible signature taste or style. We also had a salad which was supposed to be Greek but didn't really measure up (no cucumbers, no onions). We'd go back but mostly due to the lack of quality pizza places in town.",

You can watch the kids in the arcade while you sit and eat and drink. There are several large tvs throughout, with every single sports event you can think of. The pool rates are inexpensive at only $6 per hour. The only sketchy issue I had was that there was a back entrance which led into a room where horse race betting is going on, and it's close to the arcade.",

I reckon it would be cooler if there was more of an outside 'vibe' there, especially being a block out of the way from the other downtown restaurants... I am still a fan.",

The music is usually good (maybe more trendy for my tastes, but that doesn't take away from it, obsly).  What does, though, is their service.  Super slow.  It's usually _okay_ (the service that is), but I've had a rude bartender or two!  I suppose that comes with the rush of a fast paced and crowded bar on a Saturday night.All in all, I wouldn't say Jupiter is extremely outstanding, or extremely poor.  It's just a run of the mill bar in downtown Champaign (though, it could pretty much be places anywhere).  It offers some great entertainment, with some good refreshment (albeit expensive!!), with the option of a thin crust pizza!  Totally a three-starer!",

With pizza I normally dislike thin crust very much but at this place I'll choose it over almost anything else ever had. The BBQ is awesome as well and when they have the jalapeo poppers they are also best ever had.Now the bad.. The place looks wise is run down and also very random.. Also a place with a bar that closes at 8pm even on weekends in a college town at that? Just makes you wonder what they are doing. Also while it has only ever happened once in about 25-30 visits I did once on a totally dead Sunday afternoon sit down for 20 mins before being talked to and my wife and I just left. But other then that one time the place was amazing every other so 4/5 definitely.",

As much as the hype surrounds it, I thought it was as good as it was gonna get. But I was wrong. Po'Boys isn't really too fancy in terms of appearance. It is quite plain but the interior is extremely clean and well kept. The staff are really nice and knowledgeable. I tried the BBQ platter and everything was delicious and tasted homemade - including the sauces - Amazing! The italian beef was nice and tender without being too watery as it often is when its not done properly but this one was perfect; the pulled pork was nice and flaky but still had that bite to it. And the best part was the polish sausage, nice and juicy, brimming with flavor. (The sausage was much better than Black Dog's by the way)....there were also three 'mini ribs', which were a bit firm but still delicious. And the best part? Almost half the price of any competition. If you're in the Urbana area, and need a quick, delicious, and good value meal, DO NOT MISS THIS PLACE!!!!",

The other big seller for me...homemade PIE...amazing.  We were too full to actually eat the pie in the restaurant so we took 3 slices home, yes 3, and all were amazing.Service:I went on a Friday afternoon for lunch.I was seated quickly and had a water and drink from the bar in a few minutes.  My order was taken quickly and our food came out soon after.  Support a family-owned small business over a chain restaurant.",

I have been only once since they changed ownership.I hear that they have good food, mostly reminiscent of the apparently hallowed former Chambana institution of the same name. The word is the current owners bought recipes from the family that ran the old Po' Boys. Next time, I'll try the BBQ.When I went (in winter), I had beers and a fried cheesecake with jelly syrup and ice cream dessert in a martini glass. It was really good. Service was also good. Beer selection was pretty good, about a half-dozen of the usual suspects on tap with a better selection in bottles, although the prices were kinda high.The room on the right seems perfect to rent out for a medium to large size gathering. I have been a over the summer to watch folks play sports (when it was still the OTB), and it is pretty good for that. Decent prices on light beer in bottles.All in all, this place is merely average at best, with prices a little higher than I would expect. If you live out in the country and this is the closest place to you, I can see it being your go-to place, especially to watch sports. If you live in central Chambana, dont have a softball or volleyball game there, and are not a BBQophile, you have no reason to go to Po' Boys.",

We don't like spicy food so went with the sweet BBQ. The fries were basic but good. Service was pretty fast and friendly. Did not try out the pies but maybe next time? :)",

Menu is regular with good choices for barbecue and pizza. I enjoyed their fresh fries with some jalapeno-cheese sauce. They have nice thin crust pizza for reasonable price and its really delicious. I would strongly recommend this place for thin-crust pizza. Nothing extraordinary, just the regular menu prepared right.",

He swore they were from Aldi's.  He then had a bbq sandwich, while I tried out the shrimp po'boy.  My bread was super chewy and unedible.  I think it was microwaved, it was warm but dried out.  Also, the shrimp were cut up into smaller pieces, so I had 3 whole shrimp at max on my sandwich.  It was ridiculous.  They also charge for extra sauces.  That's only annoying because it's not spelled out on the menu.They have a full bar, but not specials.  Well that's gonna attract customers.

The sauce is lovely and not too sweet, the toppings are wonderful (see: fresh portabello mushrooms), and the crust makes me think of home.The price is also right and the sampling of non-pizza plates is good. Please please please support Amano's. It's deserving of the attentionI will be returning many times I can promise that",

I always heard rumors of their amazing pizza, but I never made it over to that part of Urbana to find out for myself.  Now, we order it probably a little too often for it to be healthy for us.  My husband and I just think it is fantastic.  I find myself craving it at least once a week.  We usually get the Chicago Style with pepperoni, mushrooms and green peppers.  It is amazing.  The ingredients taste really fresh.  The dough is thick, but not too chewy.  The sauce is so good.  I think everyone should give them a try.",

That said every now and again i have a hankering for chicago style and this one didn't disappoint.  What i don't like about chicago style is its often too doughy.  when i eat papa dels its like chewing on an undercooked dough ball and a lot of it.  not good.  Amano's crust however was fantastic, i ate every bite, not doughy at all with a nice \"pull\" you get from well crafted pizza dough. Nothing is more important than a great crust and they nailed it. Yes, sauce is important too and they have Great sauce, spice, great sausage (though papa dels sausage is hard to beat), just a really well balance pizza which isn't easy on a chicago style.  Family run, very clean, super friendly and fairly priced, go ahead eat great pizza!  As this was my first visit i'll have to update when i get a chance to try their thin crust.  cant wait!",

I was a bit thrown off by seeing a huge rack full of what I thing was canned sauce but that may have been the best thing ever to come out of a can this side of beer!  I ordered a 14' pepperoni, sausage, bacon, onion, and black olive deep dish pie and wasn't disappointed.  I could have done some cheap weight lifting with how heavy this monstrosity of deciduousness.  All of the toppings tasted fresh and the sausage was especially amazing.  I think my taste buds got pleasures to the point where it might have been sexual...I may have issues too but who knows?  Why 4 stars?  Well the first slight problem I had was that they offer free spices such as garlic, salt, pepper, and a whole host of others that I wish they would have told me about over the phone as I would have liked said spices to be heated with the pizza for better integration.  The other slight slip is that my pizza came unsliced.  This meant that I was made to suffer from unbearable hunger until I was able to squire a pizza slicer.  It was as if the pizza was playing with my emotions.  Both small issues but combined they cost a star because 5 stars are awarded for complete perfection.  Awesome grub though and I love to support mom and pop businesses!",

I'd pick it up, the drivers will go just about anywhere but you're adding on delivery time that you could be spending eating fresh hot pizza. This is not a sit down place, its counter only, but the owners are pleasant and chatty, the place spotless, and the pizza is awesome. Try the dessert pizza too.",

Well, mission: accomplished!Delivery time was less than an hour from ordering and I do believe it cost less than Papa Del's for a similar sized pie.We got sausage and pepperoni on ours and my only complaint was that there wasn't very much of either of these on the pizza, especially pepperoni. Although they were definitely not omitted, I'm not subtracting stars for that reason because I usually like my pizza very plain (cheese only) so it didn't matter to me.We thought the sauce was a bit more liquidy than most Chicago style pizzas but actually realized this was a good thing because it dripped into the crust and cheese making it more flavorful.It was loaded with wonderful cheese! Stringly, hot, gooey and awesome cheese! Yum!Also noteworthy was the crust, it was not too thick and not too thin, as sometimes deep dish can be. Overall we were pretty satisfied with our second deep dish delivery in the C-U area and I would definitely like to try some of Amano's other items as well.Just because Amano's isn't right in Campustown doesn't mean it isn't worth getting!I will order again!",

The Family Pleaser is what we always get.  Which just adds an iceburg lettuce salad and soft drinks to a pizza order.  Nothing bad, but nothing great either.",

I think the pizza here is better than at the other one (if you have read my review of the other Monicals you would understand).  I typically get carry out and lately they have had coupons for a $4 or $5  individual pizza which is the perfect size for lunch. Yesterday, I ate in with a friend and I must say this place is loud.  Over the top loud.  I had a very hard time hearing anything my friend said.  We finished our food and got out of there so we could visit.  Our waitress seem pissed off about something so we were very careful not to ask her for anything.  She never smiled in fact, I am not even sure she said 2 words to us.  It took 10 minutes for her to come and take our drink order.  She also slammed down our salads, the dressing and our drinks and flew off in huff.  I swear we did not do anything to make her mad.  However, I do believe if I had to work in such a loud place I would be pissed off too.  We heard a bunch of plates fall back in the kitchen and we knew what had happened.  And that really made her madder.  Oh dear!  So, we ate our food, paid our bill (yes, we left her a tip) and ran out the door.  We agreed that we would not eat in again but we will get the take out.The salad was cold and fresh and the dressing was really good.  The pizza was cooked just right and I asked for light green pepper and I got 7 pieces.  Bottom line is the food is good but I would advise carry out or delivery if at all possible.",

Might not be enough food for someone used to eating a whole pizza in one sitting from a chain place but then that itself is just no way to live. About 45 minutes after I left I could still smell a nice pizza smell on the outside of my drink cup.",

The man on the phone informed me that their pizzas take a mere 2 minutes and 20 to cook & that I would be much better off coming in to order it so it would be fresh. \"How precise!\" I initially thought which changed to the realization, that they might be making their pizza in a microwave! When I walked in, the smell reminded me of subway which made me a little anxious about my decision to try this place. I went with ranch sauce and chicken. I like that they list the farms that provide their meat. That's a nice touch if you care about where your meat is sourced. When you walk up to the counter, you basically find yourself at a sandwich line but instead of loaves of bread, there are two sizes of pizzas. I saw a girl busily rolling out crust so that's a good sign that it's made fresh in store and there's also a real oven. When the woman at the line started assembling my pizza, it soon became painfully obvious that it was probably her first job ever in food service. She was soooooo sloooow and needed instruction from some of her more seasoned coworkers. I went down to the cash register to pay. The employees there also didn't seem to have much experience ever working jobs. The girl on the register didn't really know how to use it and she busily chatted with the girl who boxes and serves the pizza. What felt like way more than 2 minutes and 20 seconds later, I finally was walking down the street with my pizza. In the end the pizza was definitely bursting with flavor but Azzip Pizza is just another fast casual chain and I'm not sure it's worth going out of my way for it. There are only two sizes and they're both pretty small and designed for one person so don't expect to come here with a large group of friends to socialize or anything.",

I had no interest in coming here until I found out that they make VEGAN PIZZA FOR THE SAME PRICE AS NON-VEGAN PIZZA. Do you even understand how rare that is in these backwoods? You don't even understand (unless you're vegan): vegan drunk/junk food in this town is limited to garlic breadsticks and water (Yeah, that's right. Fries aren't always vegan. Not at McDonald's, anyway). There is no stumbling to a kiosk down the block for vegan cheese-laden heart-attack-on-a-stick like we're in NYC. We are not in NYC, son. True, it'd be cool if vegan pizza cost less than non-vegan pizza considering the fact that vegan pizza doesn't require the cost of raising ACTUAL ANIMALS, but that's the USDA for you. I'm just happy that it doesn't cost MORE than non-vegan pizza like other vegan specialty foods do.When I found out about the vegan options here, I blew my phone the fuck up texting people who might be interested. I had to go try it. The food looked amazing in the Yelp photos. All right. The pizza did not taste as good as what the photos looked like. It was not tasty, period. The sauce was weak and not flavorful. The dough-- the base, the mother of the pizza-- was not good. It tasted like how play-doh smells, you know what I mean? It had the consistency of play-doh as well. I wanted to run away when I saw that they had pre-rolled a sad, flat looking piece of dough out, but I stayed to give it a chance. I only like thin crust pizza but this wasn't a crust at all. It was just unyummmy, undercooked flatbread. Good pizza should have everything on point from the bottom up. There was no artistry in the ingredients either. At Chipotle, they have creative, proprietary blends of even their most basic ingredients. Azzip was nearly grocery store-to-pizza level of involvement. The sauces, the toppings, the spices were just meager and uninteresting. The vegan chicken was also really bad... I've tried a lot of meat alternatives and have made my own seitan, so I can tell you that this chicken was subpar. It tasted like cleaning chemicals. The consistency was good though. The good part of the pizza was that the vegan cheese was fantastic. Daiya is known for making great melting cheeses, and they delivered. This has nothing to do with Azzip's performance, but at least they carry it. All in all, I would come back only because they can make vegan pizza. Not because their pizzas are made well. I added another star for this. Otherwise, Azzip would definitely be a two-star place. The food is not worth the cost, considering how basic and untasty it is.",

I've been to Pie Five back in the chicago suburbs, so this is pretty much the same thing. You get to pick your own toppings and they make your pizza in front of you. Pretty neat, and it does only take about 5-6 minutes for it to cook.I ended up making a buffalo ranch chicken pizza while the wife made a pesto chicken one. They were pretty good, and wasn't overly priced. Though I remember being a college kid and a penny pincher, and if I were still a broke and in school I don't see my self coming back here too often with some other cheaper choices around. Though give it a try, it wasn't too bad.",

This fast casual eatery was pretty quiet and I was impressed by how clean the restaurant was. (I hope that when this place becomes more busy, they keep up with the cleanliness!) I ordered a \"big zip\" and my friend ordered a \"little zip\". The staff makes the pizza in front of you and adds as much or as little of specific ingredients as you'd like. They are very friendly and will add as many veggies as you want with no extra charge! The big zip was easily enough food for two girls and costed only $7.50 before tax (with no meat added). The staff was VERY friendly and seemed to be excited about having customers come in. The pizza was pretty good, typical thin crust pizza. As a veggie fan, I really enjoyed the limitless veggies on my pizza! It only took a few minutes to make, which was awesome. My only 2 complaints- the cheese wasn't completely melted. It could've probably used another minute in the oven. Second, I was disappointed that there was no option for whole wheat crust.Regardless, I was very pleased with the atmosphere, service, and food. I will definitely be back and would recommend you try it too!",

I was pretty hungry after class that day so I decided to give it a try.The line was nearly out of the door and it wasn't even 5pm yet, but seemed to be moving so I figured I'd wait it out.I got to the front of the line and tried my best to recite a very specific order. I had a big zip which was half just red sauce and sausage, the other half was a chicken pesto with literally every topping.Since I had two different meats, there was an upcharge and my 11'' pie still only came out to about $5.50, which was a pretty good deal, I'd say.My more \"traditional\" red sauce and sausage half of the pizza wasn't bad. I thought it needed a little more sauce, and the sausage wasn't anything special but still alright. I feel like coming from the suburbs/Chicago my pizza standards may be a little high in general.The other \"everything\" half was better, I'd say. The pesto sauce was pretty good and most of the toppings tasted fresh. The chicken was kind of buried but it seemed to be tender and blend well with the other toppings.Overall it was great for $5.50 and definitely a unique concept as far as the build-your-own pizza goes, but I think I'd prefer a more traditional style pizza place if I had to pay full price at Azzip.",

This is the place I turn to around this area to replace my cravings for pizza, more specifically the Lou Malnati's deep dish.I only order on Mondays for the 50% off pizzas which makes it pretty legit. If you're not looking for high end taste but just a generally good pizza experience, it's the place to go.SO my story is that I go on Mondays, get a large pizza for 50% off, and just eat it for all my meals which last me til Wednesday. ~12-18$ for 3 days of meals isn't so bad. . . especially if I get sick of it by the last slice.Promptness is average. sometimes it runs longer though. I'd give it an extra 10-15 min after the estimated time.",

The sauce is nice and thick and garlicky which I loved as well.

However, I'm always in search of other great Chicago-style pizza in the Chambana area as well, so I decided to give Rosati's a try after reading some decent reviews and seeing a few pictures of their deep-dish pizzas online.  Unfortunately, my Rosati's experience was mostly disappointing.  First, my friend and I arrived at the restaurant and ordered a medium deep dish pizza and two drinks for dine in (about $20 in total).  We were then given cheap Styrofoam cups, paper/plastic plates, and plastic utensils.  I'm sorry, but if Rosati's is going to offer a dine in service, they should at least provide better quality utensils, glasses, plates, etc. (especially since deep dish pizza is very messy and can be hard to cut- even with proper silverwear).About 40 minutes later, our pizza was brought out to our table.  The wait time wasn't really an issue- I'm used to that from Papa Del's.  Great Chicago style pizza takes time to make... unfortunately the pizza we received from Rosati's was less than great.  In fact, it was probably the greasiest pizza I have ever attempted to eat.  Also, the cheese and sauce both had an artificial taste (reminded me a bit of Pizza Hut- aka far from 'natural'-tasting ingredients).  The best thing the pizza had going for it was the crust- which was comparable to Papa Del's and traditional Chicago-style pizza in general.  However, that wasn't enough to save it from the grease overload and artificial taste that made my friend and I give up after eating one piece each.So yeah, Rosati's was not for me.  If you decide to give it a try, I wouldn't recommend dining in due to the poor quality utensils (though the dining environment itself is alright).  When it comes to the pizza itself, expect A LOT of grease and a taste that doesn't quite match real Chicago-style pizza (though the crust is close).",

With consistently tasty and (pay attention here, Papa Del's) perfectly cooked pizza, Rosati's is the new C-U standard for za. The calzones are awesome as well. I order the italian beef and onion and haven't been disappointed - generous ingredients with melted mozz oozing out. Their marinara is tasty, albeit just a little thin. My daughter ordered boneless chicken and it was also good. Maybe fried just a bit too hot since the breading is on the crunchy side, but real blue cheese dressing on the side  (nice chunks of b.c.), instead of cheap salad dressing like a lot of places. There are many other menu offerings - burgers, salads, bbq beef, spaghetti, etc. - but as far as pizza goes, Rosati's is second to none in C-U.",

I'm 99% positive they buy it frozen from a box. The employees had no idea that the cannoli was even on the menu and had to ask a bunch of other employees about it. Then they had to ask about where they kept it. I believe it was the manager who responded. She looked very confused like she hadn't had anyone order a cannoli at this Italian restaurant in decades. They finally found it and microwaved it for me and it tasted like freezer burn. I don't know why I was under the impression that they had a bakery case from which to pull out a lovely, fresh cannoli. Pizza is just whatever.",

This should go without saying but I've started using EatCU lately and they've got some pretty good deals for the food here. I got The EatCU daily steal with ten bucks of food for $5.. I was planning on getting something delivered but the gift card had to be used in-store so I decided to get lunch there with a friend today and I'm so glad I did. The ambience is great! I ordered a lasagna which, as the others commenters all agree, is more than good enough for one serving. The salad sucked and the breadsticks were ok but the lasagna made up for more than the flaws. My friend got a vegan pizza and they were more than accommodating with the preparation and it looked great. I would warn you that it seems like the workers like to leave right on time though because I came here at 10:59 last night and they said they were closed. Fortunately Merry Ann's on the corner is open 24/7!",

I realize it's a new place, but the pizza by the slice is greasy enough to detract from any deliciousness. I thought I'd try their other dishes to give them another chance, but they weren't much better. Salads are made of the cheapest greens, the marinara sauce was watery and over-acidic...and horrors of horrors the garlic bread was both devoid of garlic and had a lovely microwave-petrified texture. I won't go here again.",

I am only speaking to the thin crust though, I've never had the deep dish.  I have had it delvered and picked up and it is always a pleasure to deal with the people there.  The last time they had a mix up and I had to wait an extra five minutes for my pizza.  The manager came out and apologized profusely, offered to have it delivered to me and gave me a coupon for a free pizza.  On top of that, the guy who messed up the order came out and personally apologized.  You can't beat the service in my mind. The pizza is true Chicago thin crust, cracker crust, good sweet sauce, and tons of cheese. Some of the other reviews didn't like the amount of cheese, but I think its perfect.Definitely give the place a try, you won't be disappointed.",

Their slice special (different type of pizza every day of the week.  For example Tuesdays and Fridays are Meatza).  You get a slice of pizza and a drink for $5.2. Their stuffed pizza.  Don't make the mistake of getting the \"Chicago Style Deep Dish\" pizza.  It's not the slice of heaven that you are looking for.   \"Stuffed\" is the name they give to their real Chicago style delight.I think it is hands down the best in this town.  The only downside is that it is almost twice as expensive as Amano's, but if you are trying to impress someone, Amano's just won't do.The other stuff on the menu is ok.  Some of it is interesting (their stuffed cheeseburgers are rather unique), but it's all standard fare things.For those who have visited other Rosati's, this place is probably different than the others.  For example, the one in Bloomington, IL is a sit-down restaurant, where you tip the server.  The one in Normal, IL is a to go only shop.  This is squarely in the middle.  They have a fairly large seating area, but there's no service provided.  They give you paper cups/plates, and you get your own drinks.  If you need anything else, you have to go up to the counter and ask for it.The TVs at this place aren't huge, but if you go during a Cubs game or Bears game, they're always tuned to that station, and the sound is turned on.  It's a pretty nice spot to watch part of a game and eat a bit of pizza.  The pictures on the walls are mostly Chicago landmarks, and really add to the feel.  I've never lived in the Chicago area, but for those who are from that area, this will definitely make you feel a bit like you are home.",

                "review": "Saturday night pizza craving + my calorie-based diet cheat day + a little drinking = ordering way too much delivery food than I should have.I didn't feel like getting a Papa John's or Pizza Hut-esque pie despite how cheap they are, so I checked out Rosati's website for coupons and what kind of 'za I could get for myself.I settled on a 12'' half cheese and half pepperoni/sausage with the \"double dough\" crust, plus a half pound of boneless wings, and a coupon for free delivery. Yes, this was way too much grub for 1 sane person, but I was hungry and had leftovers for the next day.Delivery took a very long and hunger-stricken hour and 15 minutes from the time of order, which even for a Saturday seemed a bit long, especially considering the place is less than a mile from my place. I probably should have just walked there and picked it up.....The pizza wasn't bad! It is really thick though and I was wishing I would have gotten the classic thin crust (oops!). Thick cheese on the other hand, is always good in my book! But I felt that there could have been more sauce, too. As you can tell from the picture, Rosati's puts the toppings underneath the cheese, which is honestly kind of a pet peeve of mine because you can't really tell how much meat is on there, or where it is on the pizza in some cases! Either way, not bad compared to Domino's/Papa John's whose \"meats\" are of questionable substance and taste. Overall not a bad pie but probably not the best or my favorite on campus, either.Strangely enough, I actually really enjoyed the boneless wings! Who would have thought that a decent place to get wings on campus was Rosati's? Not me! They come by the weight and I ordered 1/2 pound which was about 5 giant boneless wings. I got them with the chipotle sauce which was flavorful and adequately spicy. A lot of pizza place wings can be really dry on the inside and be the size of Ping-Pong balls, but these were pretty moist, had a nice breading on them and were nearly the size of billiard balls! I would order these again!What really made this only a 3/5 experience was the price. Rosati's is comparably expensive to some of the local pizza spots, my whole order was ~$21 including free delivery but excluding tip. Most of the coupons on the website don't give you more than $1 or $2 off, so this was without question a pricey pie and wings night.",

I've always had good customer service when I've been there, so it may be a hit or miss situation! The last time I went I got a thin crust pizza and cheesy garlic bread--the garlic bread was a sub roll with baked cheese on top, so my advice is to stick with pizza or other simple apps like fries. Definitely coming back!",

Super fast and super cheap is the name of Antonio's game. Not to mention the very interesting pizzas you can try by the slice. Make no mistake, this place is NOT fancy (e.g. patrons can get water out of a big orange cooler). But it doesn't need to be. Antonio's is great for a quick lunch/dinner and it is really, really great for as post-bar food stop.The bottom line here is: If you are interested in weird shit on your pizza, if you want a quick meal with zero frills or if you are more than a little tipsy, check this place out.",

True the Sicilian that everyone loves is greasy, but the normal crust vegetarian pizzas are rarely greasy at all.  The average price for a slice in 2.50 to 3.50 I think, I usually ate there for $5.

Only downside was that one of our pizzas was barely cooked.  We threw it in the oven for a few minutes though once we got home and it was as good as ever.  All and all, really delicious pizza for very cheap prices!",

We talk about how we can't wait to go to Antonio's in the afternoon before we get ready, as we're walking to the bars, and while we're at the bars.I recommend the barbecue steak and bacon, although the steak has been tough for me once. There's also a steak and bacon ranch, subbing ranch for BBQ, obviously. Buffalo chicken bleu is spectacular, with lots of blue cheese and good vinegar hot sauce. The tortellini is good, but I've had the shells be undercooked before, and if they have the gyro pizza, you should not miss it. SOOOOO good. And it's $3 a slice for a massive slice. At 2am, I'm usually pretty hungry, but even then two slices is a lot for me. This never stops me from getting two, though.OK - it's not ultra gourmet, wood oven pizza. and yes, it's kinda greasy. But guess what. It's in freaking Champaign, IL - not even the cultural flower of the C-U area. And I don't eat pizza as a health food.Fight the post bar crowd, and do it. Or, even better, go every day for lunch, and accelerate their inevitable domination of this planet.",

Za's offers nearly infinite permutations of toppings, but Antonios offers other forms of diversity in the form of quirky crusts and toppings. There is tortellini pizza covered with surprise!-oodles of tortellini or the chicken blue pizza, which is basically a chicken wing on a crust. Personally, I like the sicilian cheese pizza, which has a buttery flaky crust that beats out any other pizza in the area. However, I do think freshness and ingredient quality is a problem here, as well as typical American-pizza greasiness. It's better than many of the pizza places on Green st., but still suffers from college-pizza syndrome.",

I am EXTREMELY picky about my pizza and as far as I'm concerned pizza sucks outside of New York and I really don't eat it in other states because it is so far from what pizza is supposed to be, most of the time. But this place is one of the few exceptions I'll make. So many places call themselves New York pizza and claim to be New York pizza, and many of them succeed fooling the tourists or locals who don't know any better. In fact there is a pizza place 2 doors down from here that sucks so bad, but it's always packed with drunk idiots. Granted, this place is tiny and there may be a wait, but it is so worth it. REAL New York pizza in a pizza parlor with New York attitude, the way it's supposed to be! And for pete's sake, by the slice the way it's supposed to be! When you want a quick lunch, who wants to wait around for a whole pizza to be cooked at \"personal\" small size which means more dry lousy crust and less good middle pizza? Everyone in NY learned that a century ago and somehow the rest of the country hasn't caught up? I love that the kids working there blast metal music and just don't care because they know they've got the best pizza and people will come regardless. Arinell's: Keep on keepin' on! I Love You.

They have so many different kinds of pizzas with combinations you would never even think of - from putting pasta tortellini on there, Mexican pizzas with actual tortilla chips, baked potatoes, and they all taste awesome! My all time favorite though is the Chicken Bacon Ranch SICILIAN slices, I could seriously have that be the only thing I eat for the rest of my life. Great place to come for the drunken munchies after the bars or at any other time of the day. Be warned though, if you go after the bars close or near that time you will be standing around for quite a while...but so worth it!",

I would recommend going only after drinking, because you're really only coming here for the toppings and not the actual pizza part.I really need to switch it up though, I always get the mac and cheese and then some form of meat pizza, chicken buffalo, meat lovers, etc. Though delicious, maybe i'm just missing out on the other choices.

There are a lot of types of pizza, which is cool. Service was great, and they gave me a handy rundown when I informed them that I was new to the place.Food was cheap, at $3.90 for a slice of mushroom and a medium soda, which is just about perfect.However, I found myself disappointed by the pizza. Having lived in the area for years, I've simply had better. Not enough sauce, not enough cheese - it was just off. New York style pizza should be gooey and messy and very saucy. The other reason that I left a 2-star review is because the bathroom was appallingly gross. There was water next to the floor drain, and no soap in the soap dispenser - especially unfortunate because the bathroom itself was just gross. I don't usually say this about restaurants because I can usually pick pretty well, but I won't be back.",

It is close to the main quad (as opposed to many places that are past  6th or 5th street) and it is convenient if you need a quick bitePizza quality is \"meh\", pretty oily, crust is lacking with regard to flavor. They have daily specials such as \"buy 2 slices get a free drink\" and \"buy 2 slices and get a 3rd slice free\", but I have not had good experience with these.  The first time I went, I bought 2 slices and as the person was ringing me up, I saw the sign on the side and inquired about my free drink (it was during the free drink time), she responded, with much attitude \"you could have told me!\", but she did give me my drink.  Another time I went during the \"buy 2 get a 3rd free\" time, and asked for 2 slices of cheese pizza.  As they were being reheated, I was asked to pay, so I did.  Still waiting for my pizza to be reheated, I noticed the sign.  I inquired about the 3rd slice but was told that I had to have asked before paying.  I asked if I could be refunded and then they could reprocess my order, but the guy said he couldn't do that.  He said he had to \"keep track\" of the pizzas, otherwise he would get fired (mind you I have seen them throw away old pizza slices when they are running out of room for their new pizzas).  He then went on about the various signs everywhere displaying the deals (which by the way are small) and how his outdoor sign kept falling over.   I didn't feel the need to argue any further, so I waited for my pizza.  The guy then stepped back and whispered to the other guys behind the counter, after which they \"just happened\" to say the same things he did, pointing out the same outdoor sign and all.  I took my pizza and left, and don't really feel like going there again.",

They always have a big selection of classic/veg/weird toppings on the slices to pick from and the crust is way way better than any of the standard cardboard chain stuff you might find down the street.  I wish I knew when the slices were freshest, like a krispy kreme hot light or something.  Either way it's still an extremely cheap, pretty yummy Green St option.  It's not really the kind of place people stay for more than 15 min and I sometimes wonder if part of it is that they always have a really cheesy 80's/pop station playing loudly in the background.",

Can't top that.   I stick to the traditional Italian toppings.   Antonio's comes very close to the Brooklyn pizza I grew up with and I like stopping by for a slice or two or three.  Staff is very friendly, too.  Fun guys who seem to enjoy their work.  My only complaint is its location and the lack of parking.  I work nearby, so it's not a problem during the week, but over the weekend, when I'd really like some slices, it's not very convenient.  Open another in Urbana!!!

Antonio's sells thin New York style slices and whole pies if you want them and their menu is very expansive from tex-mex to chicken-pesto. They always have a something different everyday.For me, I usually stick to a slice of mushroom and a slice of Sicilian pizza. The Sicilian is a thick crust pizza with a sweet sauce, it's really delicious. The are vegetarian options galore from artichoke pizza to pasta pizza. The food overall is definitely food on the go I'd say catering to the student lunch and drunk 1am crowd. Antonio's would definitely hit the spot to satisfy that hunger while you're drunk. Prepare for some clogged arteries because their pizza is pretty greasy, but I don't complain. The flavors aren't complex, but we're talking pizza here folks.  2 slices of pizza will probably run you from $4 to $6 so you definitely get full.Note: Their water is free, but the temperature in the sports looking water cooler is usually tepid. Pop is $1 and refills are 50 cents.I've never ordered delivery, but I image that would be a nightmare (I've only seen one Antonio's car in their lot) so stick to dine in or carry out.Looking for cheap, greasy, satisfying food? Look no further than Antonio's.",

Antonio's is a tiny space of joy in a world that can be excessively painful.  I imagine it as an island of tranquility, if that tranquility comes equipped with some of the most ridiculous pizza ideas ever and a host of smooth nineties slow jams.  And that is what I need every Monday afternoon, when Antonio's has a buy one slice get one free special.  So I pay about $3 for two huge slices of pizza and a half hour of belting out Toni Braxton, Babyface, maybe if I'm lucky a little Alicia Keys?  Hell yes.The slices themselves range from inspired to bizarre to terrifying, but they generally mange to pull of the crazy flavour combinations.  They have gyro, nachos, fresh mozzarella with pesto, potato wedges and bacon, and any number of other combinations.So on a Monday afternoon, you can find me sitting over a double slice of heaven, singing \"You'll Always Be My Baby.\"  And I wouldn't have it any other way, Antonio's.",

The first time I ordered pizza, the second time I ordered wings.  Antonio's carries several interesting special pizzas. Being a by-the-slice place, it's understandable that the pizza isn't exactly fresh out of the oven. But here, the pizza goes through an intricate reheating process that makes you wonder how long it's been out. The machine is good at what it does, and I wish i had my own, as I don't typically eat leftover pizza. Still, makes me wonder.Wing wise, the chicken was really good quality, but lacked a on the sauce. To put this in perspective, I enjoyed 57 North wings more. Bottom line, Antonio's isn't bad, but with Pizza Hut and Wing-n-Out down the street, there are better options out there.",

It's tasty, with good amount of sauce, cheese, and toppings.One night when I was on my way home from a late night at work, I stopped at Jets and ordered a small pizza. By the time I got it home, it was after midnight, but I realized that they'd forgotten to put sauce on it. Having worked in the service industry for a long time, I understand that mistakes happen, especially late on a Saturday night. I called, and the owner spoke to me, and asked if I could bring the pizza back in, which I did. Obviously it was obnoxious to have to go back out, but he was extremely helpful. He refunded my money, and gave me a large remade pizza for free, along with a soda. He was also genuinely apologetic -- in fact, you could tell he was mortified. He used it as a training opportunity with his staff, which is constructive.Although I try not to eat pizza with too much frequency, I'd highly recommend this place for not only the flavor, but also their business ethic, and the convenience of their hours.",

                "review": "As another review said, this place really deserves more of a 3.5 than a 3, but that's the only option. On a late night, I decided to take the deal on the ad: 10.99 for 1 large 1 topping pizza and 1 small deep dish pizza for free. I went with pepperoniIt was a fantastic deal really. In 20 minutes, I went out to pick up the pizza and brought it home to try for the first time. The pizza actually tastes pretty fine, but my one gripe is how greasy it is. I guess that's how they achieve the crunchy crust and it does have great texture, but the greasiness can get overwhelming after a few bites. Actually, the oil is itself a flavor of the pizza it seems. The way I figured around it was to put a piece of paper towel on the bottom and let the paper towel soak it up. You have an opportunity to be friendly to the environment by reusing by squeezing out  said oil from the paper towels and pan frying other items in your refrigerator. I suggest eggs. For my small pizza, I got anchovies on them. Now I've never tried that before, so here's where I don't know whether it's a matter of custom or Jet's, but I got about one anchovy each slice. I don't know if that's how it's suppose to be, or Jet's might have been a little skimpy on it. All I can say is that I felt like I was just eating cheese pizza and at one point, it turns into an anchovy pizza and vanishes soon after. Despite these things, finished the entire pizza over the course of a few days. Would I go back? I suppose if I have that particular craving for the crust. This is definitely not a place to avoid. It's worth a try. :)",

I tried a hand tossed pizza with the signature turbo crust, .  The online ordering was definitely nice, and pickup was on time.  No waiting.  The prices are fair, and the food a good serving size.  OK.  all check.The pizza itself was just OK on the whole.  The sauce was actually amazing, so huge kudos for the sauce, but the rest was lacking.  The cheese was on the blander side, and mostly added texture.  The crust was also average, and on the chewy side.  There is however a baking option for \"well-done\", so I might get that in the future over \"regular\".  The Turbo crust (the garlic, butter, and romano crust) was not anything special, and pales in comparison to Domino's pizza crust.  All and all, I'm not blown away, and I have had better pizza in the area, but I would go again.  The sauce was definitely the high point and delicious, and I have to say the deliboats look good too and I would love to try one of them.  Definitely a good little pizza place, but not the best.  You won't be upset though!P.S.  I also found out that there is no eat-in here, it's all pickup and delivery.  Just FYI.",

I think the copious amounts of cheese is what sets it apart from other pizza places. Overall service is fast. It took 20 minutes from order to pickup. The only downside is the parking lot is super cramped and hard to get into.Pros: free flavored crust options, quick serviceCons: more expensive than papa john or pizza hut, but the 8 corner pizza is amazingHidden deals:Check the website for coupons before ordering",

Despite a bit of confusion she was polite and my pizza still showed up on time, hot, and the order was correct. We got a hand-tossed pizza and had a coupon for a free, small deep dish. I LOVED the hand-tossed crust. I don't know what it was about it, but it was delicious, flavorful, a bit chewy and crunchy! I can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch. The deep dish was good, too. It's not like a Chicago deep dish, it's not as thick but still good! I preferred the hand-tossed crust but my husband liked the deep dish. The sauce was really awesome. It had a real fresh tomato flavor. The spices were spot on. They were real generous with the toppings.

My fianc and I ordered a pizza from them on a Sunday at 8:40pm, they told us it was more than enough time to get it to us, even though they closed at 10. 10:30 rolled around and they still hadn't shown up so we called them the next morning and the lady that answered was quite rude on the phone, so we asked to speak with the manager, he wasn't in at the time but she said she would have him 'call' us as soon as he got in. We never got a call. So I researched one of their corporate offices to file a complaint, guess what, when they say 'your business is important to us' they don't really mean it. And the reason for that is we had sent in that complaint we waited the 3 business days, it's been two weeks now. So in conclusion, Jet's is undeserving for even the corner of the star. I DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL!!                (Oh by the way, Jet's, next time the customer is distraught, take the blame and fix it. That's what a 'good' establishment does.)",

I will go back. However, if I'm really in the mood for a pizza-ish meal that's BBQ Chicken, I'll just go to DP Dough. It's a little cheaper and closer. But, I will order from a group from this place.",

Being a Chicago boy who became a Hoosier; I grew up with such names as Aurelio's, Lou Malnatti's, and Giordano's for go to's with pizza.The front desk at the hotel we were staying at suggested Jet's; and we thought we would give them a try. The young lady who took my order was perky, informative, and did an excellent job of selling the meal without coming off as pushy.They quoted 30-45 minutes for delivery, and thank goodness I was out of the hot tub early because 25 minutes later the pizzas were there; piping hot and ready. So kudos for speedy delivery and not having to run my pizza through a microwave.I cannot give 5 stars; mainly due to my own bias and allegiance to the pies of my sweet homeland. I will, however, say that this will be the official go to pizza when we are in the East Central Illinois area. There are many more specialties that Jet's offers that we will have to try next time; but I can say that at least on their pizza alone they were great. I could see this pizza going great with a cold beer and a U of I game.Thank you to all of the staff of Jet's for making a midnight pizza craving a memorable experience for all the right reasons",

Their website locks up all the time, so after I try to order online, I usually end up calling.  Then I end up on hold for 5-10 minutes (if I haven't hung up by then), and THEN I get to talk to someone who is clearly disgruntled and doesn't like to answer phones or work in a busy atmosphere.I don't know if I'm talking to the same person every time, but she answers the phone, \"Jet's Pizza, please hold.\"  Okay, I think the courteous thing to do is \"Jet's Pizza, CAN you please hold?\"  8 minutes later, she comes back and asks how she can help me.  I tell her what kind of pizza I want, and she basically cuts me off and says, \"Anything else?\" in a rude tone.  And I say I want some cheese sticks, and she does the same thing.  I just...LET ME TALK!  You are providing a service that I want, and I am paying you for it...act like you care about the customer.Anyway, I don't know what to say except that the last 3-4 months, the customer service has gone WAY down hill, and it's just ridiculous.  I wish I didn't like their pizza so much.",

The two crusts and flavors are very different.  I really don't like Garcia's sausage at all.  I always pick if off.The pizza left my hands and face feeling very greasy and that totally grossed me out!!They have no napkins so make sure you are prepared for that.  I would like to note that someone in our office ordered the Hawaiian pizza for delivery and I tried a slice of it and I thought it was really tasty but then again the grease is what mainly gets me down.

I also like good pizza crust and thus was not disappointed with my Jets slices.Parking available, delivery available, not a sit down restaurant. Check your mailbox for coupons.

We went with the former, as deep dish for me is a once-in-a-blue-moon occasion.  We picked up a large thick crust pepperoni and a thin crust of cheese. Both pizzas were lacking sauce, and in my opinon were just OK. I would not order the thin crust again, it was far too thin and had hardly any sauce on it, meh....The thick crust has potential, though. Nice almost fluffy consistency and good flavor, but you can still kind of tell that it was cheap pizza, almost along the lines of Pizza Hut/Domino's, which I actually do enjoy once in a while.It's hard to please hardcore pizza traditionalists from Chicago who frequent Aurelio's, Palermo's, etc. However, for the price of Jet's you really can't beat it and I'm sure I'll be ordering again next time I need some budget pizza.",

When we got there the \"20 minute\" approx time the website gave us wasn't even close. We got there about 40 min  later and still waited a solid 15 minutes. I get that they are new, but the website wasn't even close to approximating the time. There was a group of people waiting that obviously ordered online and were waiting around a LONG time. Finally we got the deep dish pizza, and it reminded me a lot of pizza hut, but extremely greasy. I'm not one to complain about the healthiness of pizza, but it left a weird grease film all over my mounth and fingers when I was done. It's not bad pizza, its just not anything I'd go back for considering the price. If this was 5.00 little ceasers then I would expect the greasiness.",

(a special they had advertised) I requested when ordering the pizza, that it be cut in squares, not pie shaped wedges, and was informed this was \"Chicago style\", so clearly the guy understood what I was asking. When I arrived, I made the huge mistake of not checking the pizza or bread sticks although the amount I was charged should have warned me they screwed up. I got to my office and 1) the pizza was not cut into squares, but was sloppily cut into pie shaped wedges and 2) I had a dozen bread sticks - way more than 4 according to my math. Adding more insult, there was a cobweb in the corner of the box holding my bread sticks and a teeny tiny spider dangling as I lifted the lid. Ewe!Will I ever order from the Urbana Papa Johns again? Really? You had to ask? Not only did they clearly NOT listen to or care about a damn thing I said on the phone when placing my order, but spiders in the boxes? I understand workers put the boxes together in their 'slow time' so they have them ready to go when they get busy, but come on.....have you heard of CLEANING? Shut it down!",

Delivery time is always at stated time period or faster.  The crust is thick and fluffy, the toppings ample and evenly distributed, and the cheese supplying full coverage.

Casey's pizza tastes so much like Godfather's it's unreal. No need to order extra cheese because it comes with plenty. The crust is perfect, not too thick and not too thin. My favorites are the supreme pizza and the breakfast pizza. I was hesitant to try the breakfast pizza because I was afraid the eggs would be dry and the meat would be terrible, but I was completely wrong. The eggs were perfect and the sausage and bacon (I got half and half) was perfect. I have a new favorite pizza place. I. Hunter",

It also wasn't ridiculously expensive for the area.  I like the traditional toppings as well as some of the unique offerings.The real gem(s) are the empanadas.  I hadn't even bothered to try them until my boyfriend ordered them one night.  I tried almost every flavor.  My favorites were the roasted chicken and chicken inferno, but I also liked the potato cheddar,sausage pizza, and san telmo carne/pollo.  They are best if you get there when they're fresh, have them made for you (takes about 10 minutes), or get delivery.  I think I ordered them about once a week for 3 years until I moved away. Now, I still crave them and have even resorted to trying to make my own......which are not nearly as good I might add.",

Although some of the varieties are pretty similar and really cannot be told apart without the little cheat sheet they hand out, some, such as the roasted chicken, potato and cheese(a mashed-potato like filling), and chicken jalapeno are excellent.  The sausage pizza was nothing special (a bit on the greasy side), and better can be easily found in the area.  Nevertheless, the empanadas are good enough to warrant a trip.",

The sliced pizza is well-priced, thin crust and yummy, not to mention relatively creative in the flavor department so I would recommend this to the hungry passing by. I yet to try a better pizza by the slice in this area.",

Empanadas are a little over $2 for each pocket of yum but don't let that stop you. There are deals like \"pick 6\" where you get a little discount for volume purchasing. Sometimes there are deals on Hooked or Grub Hub as well. The pizza is also delicious. It's NY style pizza so it's thin crust that's toasted when you place an order. Spotted Goat is a popular selection but my favourite is still a plain cheese slice. The place is tiny & it can get crowded in the evenings, especially if there's stuff going on at Canopy Club or Krannert. Cleanliness is not their forte. I've seen someone touch their hair then work the pizza dough with their hands. I don't like to think about that.",

The veggies tasted fresh sliced, the bacon was crispy, and there were big chunks of chicken.  It was one of the best pizzas I've had.  Not super cheap for a pizza at about $18 but so, so good.So some of the best pizzas are the specialty ones on the menu, and not just the ready-made ones under the heat lamps.  So now I say: 5 stars for the pizza, 3 for the empanadas.The pizza is - for my money - the best of its kind on campus, and certainly the best within an easy walk from the quad.  The prices per slice seemed a little high until I went to Sbarro and got a much more disappointing slice for more money.  I won't do that again.Here they usually have the traditional pizzas - cheese, sausage, pepperoni - but the standouts are their more unusual toppings.  My other favorite is the hungry goat, which has tomato, basil, mushrooms, and goat cheese.  A little bit of hot sauce from the counter and you have the perfect greasy mid-day snack.  There are other interesting options that seem to rotate - a potato pizza, a mushroom pizza, a Mexican themed pizza, and the supreme are the ones I remember from last time.  I've also seen apple butter pizza and the barbecue meats, which is good stuff.The pizza slices are about 10 inches long and 4.5 wide.  It's a more floppy, chewy pizza.  The cheeses and toppings vary, and it's usually a little greasy - though of course, it depends on what type you get.  When you order it goes in the oven to warm up.The empanadas are okay but leave me more hungry than the pizza.  I am not that great a fan of empanadas, though.  I didn't notice a huge difference between the different fillings.  I haven't tried the dessert ones, but I am told they are good.Convenient and consistently pretty good.",

You should feel happy because these people actually make empanadas from scratch instead of getting them from vendors. The crust is always flaky and consistent. I highly recommend their carne and mushroom empanadas. I think their empanadas are a little pricey for the size but it's worth paying for their extra effort of making food from scratch.",

While I haven't eaten through the amazing range of items Manolo's offers, I am confident Manolo's is the best of the two.Pizza places are ubiquitous on college campuses, so I'm never too excited when one springs up. Manolos sets itself apart by having empandas, which are an excellent alternative to pizza. They have several types ranging from the more authentic spicy San Telmo Carne to flaming potato. The three types I tried were tasty and the pastry was puffy and soft. They are perfect for an on-the-go snack since they can easily be eaten while walking.As for the pizza? The cheese pizza I tried was good and had a nice crust.  Hands down the best pizza there (and the reason for the recently added extra star) is the fresh basil and mozzarella. I had it with some friends and we all agreed it was top-notch. It's fragrant from the very fresh basil and the cheese stands out as being so much better than regular pizza cheese. Specialty pizzas are a little bizarre. The one I tried, creamy chicken gorgonzola, was sans red sauce. It wasn't bad, but it was like some cheese, chicken, spinach, and (good) portabellas on dough. More like upscale breadsticks than pizza. Make sure the description says it has red sauce if you are looking for something traditional. Ditto the other reviewer- They make their food! Surprisingly enough, this is actually unusual. Many restaurants buy pre-made items from big companies, but here at Manolos you can see them rolling the dough for all the pizza and empanadas.Delivery is slow and expensive. Pick up is the better option.",

The Modena was definitely the standout, but again, I would trust goat cheese with my firstborn. And all of my offspring after that.I also tried one of their empanadas, which I can't really review because I wanted the vegetarian version of their Argentinian spiced one, but I may have accidentally had a meaty one.  My mom ordered their spinach and ricotta empanada, but when she bit into hers, it looked like it had some kind of soy meat or real meat. Hard to tell, and I don't want to think about it too much! All I know is they definitely gave us one meaty empanada when we ordered two vegetarian ones-- major problem!!They also had a lot of problems charging our credit card. They tried three times, and we got all these fraud alerts afterward.BUT they were running a deal where you got a free medium cheese pizza when you spent $10... And they gave us two! (We did spend over $40).My brother was really excited to share this place with us, and he doesn't get excited about too much food-wise, so that of course made the whole experience a full star better!",

Otherwise, plain cheese is good enough.I've had the empanadas, and they're also pretty good. Problem is, they're too expensive for what you get. More than $7 for three measly little pockets of meat/cheese/veggies is a bit much. I suppose the San Termo style empanadas warrant a try, but for the more standard varieties, I wouldn't bother.

Take a look at what is on the carousel before you order to make sure it looks good and not all orange/cancer bubbly or burnt. They also have parm cheese, red pepper, and hot sauce. I guess it is probably not 4 stars good, but there really is nothing like booze and pizza in a music venue that often smells rather strongly of *ahem* the perennial accoutrement of musicians.

I've never had the empanadas because I've never seen the need. The pepperoni pizza is fantastic, the cheese is pretty good and the specialty slices are great- I recommend the apple butter and bacon.The staff is also wonderful- though coming in every day for a year probably helped- and I really should go more often now that I've moved. Pizza is really cheap- at $4 for a specialty slice, you can really save money on lunch costs (not as much as bringing it from home, but I'm lazy).",

                "review": "Empanadas are pretty easy to make. You have your filling - usually some kind of meat, some spices, onions, make it the night before, stick it in the fridge - and you have your shells - usually made out of masa harina. When you're ready to serve them you plop a spoonful onto the shell, roll it up, squeeze the edges and drop them into the fryer.It's not haute cuisine. Every culture has some kind of dough-and-filling staple whether it be Polish pierogis or Chinese dumplings. It's so basic it's hard to believe anyone could fuck it up.Unfortunately, someone has. These are, by far, the worst dough-and-filling creations I've ever had. The dough was soggy, the filling was dry, it was paradoxically bland and salty. The mushrooms in the mushroom and cheese empanada tasted like they were on the verge of going bad. Also, they should be fried. Not baked. Granted, I ate the empanadas during Thanksgiving break when not many students are on campus so maybe the management didn't really think it'd be worth it to make fresh empanadas. Then again, empanadas should never be made hours beforehand to sit under a heat lamp. You want to save money? Close up shop instead of serving an inferior product.Finally, it was overpriced (3 little empanadas for 6 bucks) and the service was lousy. The place felt kind of disorganized and grimy, the employees were lackadaisical. I don't expect the corporate shine and whitewash of a Jimmy John's. A little dirt can be ok, I appreciate texture, but I also like a little bit more professionalism. If the owner wants to make some real money I'd say get rid of the pizza, get rid of all the empanda options except for maybe the top two flavors (a spicy ground pork one Colombian style and maybe a vegetarian option), reduce your staff, get an industrial deep fryer, drop the price of each empanada to $2, make it three for $5, offer free salsa to top on the empanadas and stay open really late on the weekends. Let the smell of the fried goodness waft over the street and watch people line up outside of your door. Empanadas are blue-collared, street food in Latin America. They're also great when you're drunk or high and got the munchies. This place should be so much better.",

I prefer the empanadas from a new food truck called Empanada house, where the crust is about 2 mm thick and the filling isn't dry. I had to dock it 2 stars through because the price is just too damn high ($10+ for a slice of pizza and 2 empanadas).

I usually just go down there after work to pick up our order.I've had the BBQ Meats, Chicken Pesto, and the Supreme pizzas, and all were pretty decent.  Large slice thin crust (ala NY style), and they have a LOT of interesting combinations available.  For empanadas, the Inferno Chicken is by far my favorite.  I've tried several others as well and they are just ok.   The only ones on the menu that I tried and did not like was the Potato Cheddar and Raspberry Cheesecake.  They were just a mushy mess with not much flavor.  The empanadas are not really budget-friendly if you're getting them in quantity (2-2.50 each).  I don't normally get slices, but the whole pizza are just slightly above average compared to other places in town.Beware when trying to pick up an order if there is a popular show at the Canopy Club, because finding a place to park nearby is difficult if the show crowd is around.If you're tired of all the chain places in town, this is a nice choice to change things up.",

                "review": "For our weekly pizza delivery, we decided to try something new and got Manolo's.We opted for the largest size thin crust with half pepperoni and half sausage. We also got 3 empanadas for $6 to go with it, delivery time was about an hour, which is to be expected on a weekend. This amount of food was just enough for our group of 3 in terms of portions.The pizza was decent, definitely better than a Papa John's or similar chain. I didn't think it was anything spectacular though. If you like thin crust, this might be for you. It reminded me of Sbarro, except a little better. My issue with this pizza, and perhaps all thin crust/New York style is the lack of sauce. The sauce is so key to the flavor that often times without it your just eating a cheesy breadstick. I might have liked it more if there was a bit more sauce. The pepperoni wasn't that good, however, the sausage was unusually good, it tasted fresh and wasn't just a mushy piece of nothing, great flavor! I think I will get sausage if I order again. The crust was good, crispy bottom but edible edges.Feedback on the empanadas was a unanimous OK. I can only personally speak for the cheesecake empanada. The filling didn't resemble something you could get at The Cheesecake Factory, but it also wasn't just dried goop. Not too bad! I think the empanadas might be a really good bargain if you got a lot of them and the price was around $1 each.I have not tried any of the specialty pizzas and I may have to do that and then update my review. I will also have to try The Empanadas House for a fair comparison.Overall we thought Manolo's was just OK, we thought it might have been just a little pricey, but we were not disappointed with our food.I'll be back!",

Then there are your chain restaurants that produce a very doughy pizza that I'm okay with, but it's not what I love.  Some places around here claim they do \"thin crust\".  Rosati's, Monical's, even Dominoes has attempted the \"thin crust\", but they basically make pizza cracker. But then there's Manolo's!  Their pizza is reminiscent of what I remember as thin crust.  If you're from New England, I guess you would understand if I said their pizza reminded me of Papa Gino's.  A little greasy, but overall a delicious slice.  Their specialty pizzas are also very good.  Got the Spotted Goat (spinach, mushroom, mozzerella, gorgonzola, goat cheese, roasted garlic alfredo sauce and red sauce).  Fantastic.  If you're looking for a \"NY/Boston\" style thin crust pizza... you'll appreciate Manolo's.  It's not home for sure, but it does the trick.",

My friend recommended them, and I was suspicious that they could be as good as she said, but they were delicious!-The timing is great! I've ordered pizzas from other places ahead of time for advanced delivering, and the timing always seems to be 20-25 minutes off. I requested a 6:30pm delivery and it arrived at 6:25pm, which was great!The Meh:-I honestly am not a fan of the empanadas. I've tried six of them, and none of them really impressed me, and they're a little expensive for their size.- Manolo's is a little expensive. A medium specialty pizza is $14.99, but I think this has more to do with my perception of the cost of pizza, living in a college town. The pizza's are definitely worth the price though.Overall:I've had Manolo's three times, and would order again, even if it is expensive.",

The pizza crust is super-thin and crispy, and I like that the salads are ENORMOUS.  The pasta...I could live without.

I came here for the first time yeeears ago on my violin teacher's recommendation (she is a  U of I graduate and had many fond memories of the place). I have been here several times since; I always try to stop by when I'm in the neighborhood. Za's has an excellent location near campus and a lot of other restaurants, apparel shops, ice cream/froyo places, etc. Eating here can be a bit overwhelming at first because there are SO many options! You fill out a sheet of paper to describe exactly what you want with options from salads, paninis, soups, pizzas, smoothies, and more. The big selling point of Za's is that you can customize your order to exactly how you want it with any toppings, sauces, or flavors--any way you want it! After ordering, you scoot on over to the pick-up counter and wait for your food to be ready. There are tables both upstairs and downstairs, so don't fret if every table is taken on the first floor. The stairs are kind of steep, so be careful as you walk up there with your food! I usually order the \"pick two\" option. My favorite is the broccoli cheddar soup with the \"lite panini,\" which can be customized exactly how you want it. The broccoli cheddar here is one of my favorites and has grated cheddar cheese on top. Yum. The food is by no means mind-blowing. Overall, this is your standard Italian lunch food with a few very above average options, like the soup. I also highly recommend trying the smoothies here (my drink of choice is the mango). They use real fruit and fruit juice!Honestly, if you're in the area, you really can't miss a stop at Za's. Note: I last ate here before it burned down, so I can't speak to the quality of the original's replacement.",

Mia Za's is located in a cozy little row of businesses in the heart of Campus Town conveniently adjacent to the University of illinois' main Quad.  Parking can be a bit difficult, but there are usually spaces available a block or two from the location, bring money as Parking Enforcement is serious business in and around Campus.Depending on the time of day you may be hard-pressed to find ample seating for you and your dining companion as this place is very popular with the student population. If there isn't enough room on the main floor you can head upstairs to find more tables, and a warm atmosphere with a very beautiful copper ceiling, and Italian inspired artwork on the walls.Their menu is full of incredibly tasty and healthy ingredients, and everything is cooked to order. It'll probably take longer for you to decide on what to order with the custom Pizza, Pasta, Panini, and Salad options. But never fear for those you that are indecisive; Mia Za's offers more traditional favorites as well.Prices vary on what kind of sauce or items you get, and if you get extra items. With that said you can get a \"Pick 2\" where you get half an order of pasta, salad, or panini served with another half order of salad, soup, or panini for just shy of 7 dollars (without drink).",

Now that I am back I have found out that there are multiple locations which works out well. The prices are actually cheaper than when I was here for college due to a modification in the menu. For the pasta you get to select from multiple types and sauces with 4 toppings for 5 dollars. The premium protein items i.e shrimp, meatballs, chicken will run you a dollar more each. The food is prepared quickly, however I don't know if they changed it now to use a convection oven/microwave to nuke your toppings which is one down side. This is then added to a pan with the sauce and served quickly. You also get a nice piece of garlic bread. All and all this is better than McD and for the same price. There are also other options such as pizza, salads, sandwiches etc. I have never strayed from the pastaPro: inexpensive, quick, large portionsCons: microwaved toppings (i guess you get what you pay for)Hidden gem:Sign up for the perka app. You need to check in and tell the cashier so they can give you the punch to earn free food. I did not realize this and ended up not getting my first check-in. You can't just check-in which makes sense or people would abuse the system",

To boot, the employees are all very friendly. It's just a three minute walk from my office, so I suspect I'll be going there a lot to eat.",

Combine that with the somewhat hard to read forms, and there's a potential mix for disaster. I love the idea of customizable meals, but their execution is mediocre. I came one night during a slow dinner with my bf and it was practically empty. After filling out the forms, we went to wait. Half an hour passed by and three other people who came after me got their food. Another guy took a pizza I thought was mine, but the kitchen guy shrugged and insisted it wasn't. My bf got his pizza after fifteen minutes and began to eat without me while I sat around waiting. I kept asking the kitchen staff who said to be patient and wait even though I was already waiting for half an hour. After finishing my milkshake, I was clearly annoyed and not hungry anymore. I considered demanding a refund when the manager? came up to me and asked me what I was waiting for. I told him a pizza and he went to look for it. He returned and told me they LOST my form somehow in a sea of four sheets of paper. I had to fill out another one and wait even longer. When my pizza came, I decided to eat it but it wasn't even that appetizing. The crust was thin and floppy and it looked like they haphazardly threw on the toppings.  Personally, I'm disappointed with Mia Za.",

While it's not gourmet, it's a step way, way above ordinary red-sauce Italian, and it'll satisfy even the strongest cravings for something zesty. The price is great, too.Pretty much everything else on the menu---whether you customize it or not---will also be well prepared, well presented, and well received by your taste buds. Back in sophomore year of high school I had lunch here almost daily, and the only bad experience I can remember involved an unbearably spicy sauce that even my high-spice-tolerating Chinese friends agreed was over the top. (The chef may have just screwed up my particular order that day, but just to be safe, I'd stay away from any spicy option.)On a final note, I've always been surprised at how quickly my order is ready, regardless of how crowded the restaurant is.",

I find the food is always good and there is always a lunch or seasonal special e.g. summer on a Tuesday is $5 Create Your own Pasta/Pizza/Panini, free iced tea, and free chocolate strawberries. That's an entire meal for $5 and tax. Portions are always large (I usually pick 2: salad and pasta).There is plenty of seating (just head upstairs if you don't like sitting close to people or have more than a party of 2). I love the plastic cups that you can take and bring back for cheeper drinks (think Starbucks or Duckin' Donuts without the expensive coffee) and the service is always friendly. Ordering can be a little confusing the first time (which sheet is for the pasta!?) but someone is happy to help you out and ask all the important questions (artichokes? do you like olives? do you want pasta? do you like cheese?). Overall, this places is fairly inexpensive, friendly, clean, and it's always open, even in those strange summer months when no one is around.",

This new Za's is putting ingredients on pasta, microwaving it, then pouring sauce and spices on after. I don't know who thought of this cooking process but it wasn't someone who knows how to cook. It was a bad experience, and now I feel a bit sick from it. If you value your stomach and tastebuds do not go to this establishment.",

I definitely found the ordering papers overwhelming the first time I visited a Za's, but I didn't have to wait on my co-worker, who picked out a delicious meal pretty quick.  While we were waiting in line, there was a guy standing next to it checking papers and passing out cups to make sure they were clear before we got to the checkout.  This proved to be genius, because we were through the line in about five minutes.  In another 5-10, we had our food.  And it was good.  My only complaints were that my rotini wasn't exactly al dente and there were lots of onions and garlic in everything (but this is only bad for me personally).The prices vary, but if you get a lunch-sized serving and a drink, you can get out for $7-10.  If it's a little bigger, or you decide you want a slice of their delicious tiramisu, it's gonna be more like $12-15.Quick, (seemingly) fresh, 'licious.",

While looking at the bill of fare at this establishment, the owner came out and gave us a sales pitch for having our dinner there.This is a very small \"hole in the wall\" place that probably seats no more than 20 diners.  Tables are on the first floor and also on a second floor.The gimmick here is that you are provided with a ballot-like menu to order your food.  We both decided to order a pasta meal.  So, we filled out a paper form that allows you to select the type of noodles, sauce, toppings, and other items you want to eat.  Then you hand the form to the counter attendant, and they call you when your meal is ready: usually in less than ten minutes.The same procedure is used to choose salads, paninis, and pizza.We were there at about 5:45 on a Monday during the summer session, so the place was not busy.

It was wet in the middle and pretty unencumbered by flavor.I tried a smoothie once.  It was aiight.  Never been compelled to try another.I tried a salad once.  It was pretty boring, and it made me miss Pluto's back in Palo Alto.But the tomato basil soup, I love.  It's divine with its small sprinkling of grated parmesan (?) cheese that melts only halfway even though you stir it.  One thing I don't appreciate is the impatient guy who calls out my name.  He was pretty obnoxious this one time when I didn't respond on the first call.  But rudeness and some small confusion about not having a form to just order soup won't keep me away from good soup on Green Street.Under 4 bucks for a bowl of soup that comes with a small piece of french bread is good eatz.  And fast, too.",

Throwing vegetables (and sometimes fruit) in a bowl doesn't constitute a salad, folks. The pizza and pasta are ok though.I am still giving it 3 stars because they have a good selection of iced tea and the extraordinarily eclectic ambiance. There is wall art of unique silhouettes like a cat dangling from a power line and a ninja on a bike upstairs which are modestly entertaining. But there is also a great little function where you can text in a song request and a monitor will play the song and video.My choice?Birthday Song - 2 Chainz ft. Kanye West.3 stars.",

What's in a Caesar salad that makes it a \"premium\"?  Cheese, lettuce & dressing.  They can keep their cheese, lettuce and dressing.  That is way too much to pay for what it is.",

Went here last night before the dinner rush at around 4 pm. It's one of those places where they give you a sheet of paper with predetermined options on it OR the option to create your own pizza, pasta, salad, or sandwich. Most of the people working the counter are just college students and therefore not necessarily skilled in helping you create awesome meals. After staring at the overwhelming menu for a little while I ended up creating my own pizza. I had garlic marinara sauce with a feta/mozzarella mix topped with red onions, olives, and sun dried tomatoes. It was kick-ass! I ate (most) of the whole thing. I did give away some of it because it was too good not to share. I had been to this place a few years ago (before it burnt down and was rebuilt) and I remember having something delicious then, too! I believe I created a pasta that time.I really had minimal interaction with staff, but everyone seemed pleasant when I did need them to place the order. They don't really \"wait\" on you because it's seat yourself, leave your dishes at the table. Really all you're doing is ordering at a counter; kind of like a more fancy, involved, delicious subway concept.",

Seriously, where else would you go?  I've been a fan for years.I have always loved their pastas the best, and they've really expanded the options. Last time I went, I got multigrain rotini with pesto and veggies.  It felt really healthy and light, even though it was a sizable portion.  The huge and delicious piece of garlic bread did kind of counteract the \"light\" feeling, however...  I also had one of their delicious smoothies, and I have never gone wrong by ordering any of their infinite combos.  Anything with mango in it is an automatic favorite of mine!Yeah, it's not gourmet, but for an inexpensive lunch that isn't fast food or a chain place, it's definitely the best you can get in Champaign.  And oh, the nostalgia factor...",

We kept telling them about this issue and all the time they said : yeah you are right, and kept doing the same thing! Today we went there for lunch and we saw the same thing, cashier preparing food with bare dirty hands. When my friend wanted to order, he told the cashier and she just went and took the pizza bread with her hands in front of us! We tried to be calm and waited for our food. And guess what we got! My friend got his pizza with the smallest amount of cheese and toppings in the world! The whole thing was just a big bread! He got angry and asked the staff where their boss is. The old guy there said she is out of town and will be back on Wednesday. Well! And he did not accept that the staff use their bare hands to prepare food and showed us tongs and said they always use this! Well, we have never seen them use the tongs! I don't recommend going to this place anymore! NOT AT ALL! You will get dirty food, small small portions, zero-cheese-pizza and almost no topping!",

We came up to read the menu and I found the woman at the register to be a pushy sales person. When we finally decided on a pizza and were getting ready to pay, she interjects a comment about how we should leave a tip for the baker. How rude to insist that we tip? Doesn't the baker make a full wage? He's no waitress after all. We probably would have tipped anyway but it felt strange to be pressured like that. Also, I'm almost positive that they're grossly abusing the term \"local\" because it's trendy. The peppers were all listed as locally grown...then it occurred to me, it's April in central illinois, what kind of crazy magician is able to grow bell peppers right now?? News Flash: no perversion of the english language could allow for California, Mexico, or Florida to be considered local to central illinois! I would have even accepted \"regional\" but local? No way. In the end, the pizza was okay, just okay.",

It sounds scary, but was very good (and not too spicy).I'm also fascinated that they managed to install a wood-fired brick oven on a food truck.  Such a neat idea, and they executed it well.  With pizza, you worry about how long it will take to get an order out, but they can pump out pizzas quickly.  We used them for a kids party, and they were able to turn out 50+ pizzas in under an hour.  It was incredible.  We'd use them again in a heartbeat for a party.  They were very accommodating.  It was nice to have the guests get whatever they wanted without worrying about appeasing everyone with my topping choices.The ingredients are quite good too.  The Neapolitan style dough is thin and crispy and delicious.  You may want to ask them to leave it in the oven a bit longer if you want it crispier.",

So I decided to give it a try. They have seven specialty pizzas that already have toppings picked out. There is also the option of creating your own pizza. I ordered the Margherita pizza and a Red Dragon pizza. While I was waiting for the pizzas to come out of the oven, I asked the workers about how they make the pizzas and what was unique about them. They make the pizzas \"neopoliton\" style which refers to the way Italians make their pizza. The dough is hand-tossed and the pizza is baked in a ceramic oven. The workers were really friendly and helpful in choosing a pizza that I would like. We took the pizza home, which was about 15 minutes away. The pizza was still warm, but not as warm as it would have been when coming out of the oven. In my experience, I would take my pizza and eat it as soon as it was ready. Dragon Fire pizzas are not like regular American pizza's because the crust isn't seasoned and there isn't an overload of cheese. It is an acquired taste that I would recommend delving into.",

But that's exactly what Dragon Fire Pizza is. And their pizza is amazing.I'd never heard of Neapolitan-style pizza--I'm usually a deep-dish fan myself--but this pizza is seriously fantastic. Really, really tasty, with lots of flavor options, and a crunchy-chewy-slightly-toasty crust that's something special. Plus, the people are really friendly and you can tell they earnestly want you to have the best experience possible. I've visited their truck a number of times, and I always come away happy.Also, they're big on supporting the community--and great with kids! We invited them to my son's cub scout troop and they very handily taught a bunch of rowdy kids how to stretch their own pizza dough and make their own pizzas. It was unforgettable--the kids AND the parents enjoyed it a lot.When you see them out and about--and they're hard to miss!--do yourself a favor and check 'em out!",

I like spicy food and I was pleased with their self-named \"Dragon Fire\". Spicy isn't the only thing they do though. The Red Dragon is probably my second favorite.I'm not a vegetarian, but I was impressed with the large number of vegetarian pizza choices they have. And for the non-vegetarians out there, with most of them you don't even know you're eating something without meat.Probably the best aspect of their pizzas is the dough. It's very chewy, but not undercooked. It kind of reminded me of a warm flat-bread (like the kind you would use for a gyro) but thinner and warm. It folds easily so it's not droopy.Probably the best advice I can give would be for you to bookmark the \"Finder\" page on their website. They keep a current calendar and Twitter feed on there so you'll always know where they are.",

I got a Gold Dragon and it was amazing. I went to Italy and I feel like a crust snob. It needs to be crunchy and chewy at the same time for me to really love it. Dragon Fire Pizza nailed it. (Yeah for you!)  The pizza size is just enough to look like you can't eat it all, but then somehow you magically can. Boom! It's just gone. So needless to say, I ate the whole thing myself. It was hot, it was fresh, it was flavorful and it was pizza. Do I really need to say more? Like the owner said \"What American doesn't like pizza\"Just go. And don't plan to share.",

I tried one of their weekly specials (BBQ chicken pizza) last week and I did not care for it as much (and it was much more expensive).  They offer it on cardboard rounds if you are eating immediately, or in a box if you are taking it to go.  They also offer a ghost pepper cheese add-on to the Dragon Fire that I have not been brave enough to try yet, but I've heard that is good as well.  Very friendly staff, and it's freshly made pizza brick-oven pizza in just a few minutes.",

My husband took the Dragon Fire pizza challenge--it is spicy to the max.I have also gotten a custom veggie pizza with spinach, peppers, and onion, and was very pleased. Even though the crust is thin, it holds up well with multiple toppings. I like folding the slices in half, NYC style, to get all the good stuff in one bite.Courteous, fast, professional, and tasty pizza to go for $10? Yes, please.",

Their calzones are delicious, but their customer service has been dismal the handful of times I ordered from them this summer (2014). They have been rude, or noticeably annoyed/bothered when I placed an order for delivery over the phone and chose to pay with a credit card. Their drivers delivered to the wrong address multiple times, even after I clarified where I was following the first few mistakes. One driver barely said a word to me after I greeted him with friendly words, and ended up handing me a fairly burnt Ranch Buffer. The food is spectacular, I have never had a calzone from any other business even come within range of competing, but you will have to deal with pissed off, overworked college students to experience it.",

Had I been drunk when I tried it, this might have been a 5-star review. But here's the lowdown from a sober perspective.Sis & I ordered online, (there were all sorts of deals through the website and through a 3rd party... it was all a little confusing, but the 3rd party actually ended up giving us the better deal) one Safety Zone and one Spin Zone. Delivery time was right on track with what they told us (about 45 minutes). The calzones were in their own labeled boxes, and sis handed me mine (Spin). I opened the box, and then opened the calzone (which was already split in half), and yelled out in horror, \"OH DEAR GOD ITS FULL OF MUSHROOMS.\" You see, I hate mushrooms. I thought I was going to have to make an angry phone call, but it turns out they had put my calzone in the box labeled Safety, and my sister's calzone in the box labeled Spin. An easy mistake, but they really should be more careful about these kinds of things.The food was alright. The crust was a little soggy, and I could have crisped it up in the oven, but I was just so hungry. There could have been more ricotta, but thats my personal preference. 3 stars about sums it up.",

The calzones are great, and the dipping sauces are even better.  It's not too expensive, costing around $6-7 for a HUGE calzone that can easily be split up into two meals.  The calzones are packed with fresh ingredients, and you can even make your own calzone including up to 5 ingredients of your choice (more at an extra cost).  Most people pass over it too, and while it doesn't look impressive, I definitely recommend paying the extra 60 cents for the garlic parmesean dough.  It adds a ton of flavor.  Much better than the original dough used for the calzones.    Even more surprising, the cookies are absolutely amazing, and HUGE.  I would prefer these over the renowned Insomniac Cookies anyday.  They only cost about $1.50 each, but seriously, the cookie is huge.  Something like a 6-7 inch cookie.  Some days even bigger.  For only a $1.50, it's like 3 to 4 times the size of an insomniac cookie and tastes just as good in my opinion.  They even have a special where you can get two free cookies with two calzones.  Don't skip on the cookies!My only complaint is that one of the workers (who seems to be there all the time) is just always disgruntled and has been rude to customers.  Cheer him up, and there's really nothing to complain about.",

The total came to $9 with tax.I got a lot more food than I expected, but with less flavor than I would have liked. I was stuffed after eating 2/3 of the calzone, half of the fries, and all of the sauce. There was only a smidgen of spinach (mostly cheese and dough), and since I like tomato sauce, not enough of it. The soda was a splurge since I don't drink it often, but it's really not necessary.I would recommend saving a few dollars by not getting the combo, and instead getting just a calzone and an extra container of sauce for $0.60. That would put it on par with about 3 slices of decent pan style cheese pizza folded up. Think twice about paying more for toppings, because they were inconsequential in my order.Bottom line: I'm not planning on ever going back, but I don't feel sick or cheated, either.",

Yes if you order in store, you will have to wait as the calzone's are made to order so expect a while wait. Otherwise this place is well worth it. The calzones, are cooked fresh to order, plenty of ingredients for the stuffing and simply delicious. The best is the hot box deal which gets you a classic calzone, can of pop or bottle of water, and a choice of side. I went with the combat which had pepperoni, mushroom, green pepper, and sausge with spices/mozzarella. I felt there was a perfect mix of ingredients, not too little and not too much. I did not find that it was dry at all and the marina was a great side. I also went with the cajun fries, nothing special here a little soggy by the time I had to eat it. They also have other promotions where you can get a calzone and cheese stix for 10 dollars which is enough for 2 people to share. I did have to wait 10-15 minutes for my order with no one else in the shop so I would recommend ordering online or call ahead. Staff was friendly otherwise.Pro: Fresh made to order calzone, the hot box or zone/stix is a great deal, free parkingCons: Very long wait time if you decide to order in store, your best bet order onlineHidden gem:Everyday specials like the hot box and zone/stix are the way to go.",

The place that gave me something delicious to believe in, a place that never disappointed me when I opened the box. Some day, I'm going to take my kids to DP Dough.DP Dough itself is not really a restaurant - it is primarily for us cyber monkeys who do everything through the Internet, especially in ordering food. The restaurant itself has a small seating area that is almost always empty, and has exactly four seats.Now to the important part - the food. Every calzone that comes out of this place is first placed at the altar of the calzone gods and given a proper blessing. Only then does it become fit for human consumption, at which point it has spontaneously morphed from an ordinary calzone into a holy image of the calzone gods themselves. The dough is baked to a perfect crisp, and all that is contained within the dough is molded from the sinews of something superhuman. These calzones have never disappointed me, and it makes me happy to know that they never will. And unless they take down their altar to the calzone gods, my children will not be disappointed either.",

Top this with a super bland marinara sauce, and you've got a mouth full of disappointment. The cheese sticks were pretty tasty. If anything else about our order had been up to snuff, we would have thought of ordering these again.The apple pie sticks are a waste of your life.

And yes, they do deliver to far destinations and work 24/7. So when you're hungry at 3am in the morning, DP Dough is what you should go for. I know that they have wide selection of calzones.

Nice try, but A) that doesn't even make sense, and B) NO pizza, calzone or wing place in a college town supplies forks and knives -- why would they? Would you eat a sandwich with a knife and fork? Because that is exactly how you hold/eat a calzone. What a petty thing to be critical of...Anyhow, I LOVE D.P. Dough. Their calzones are incredibly fresh, and there's a TON of variety. If you should decide to build your own, there are at least 25 different ingredients to choose from, as well as different crusts and dips. I've ordered delivery (to downtown Urbana, which is a far cry from their brick-and-mortar facility) from them several times now, and it's never taken more than 45 mins. The delivery people have always been super friendly, too.D.P. Dough has definitely been one of the better dining experiences I've had in the area -- certainly the best delivery experience.",

The food is great, the staff is amazing, and I've never ever had a bad experience. However this location is by far the armpit of the chain. Where do I start with this walking crap factory? How about the guy behind the counter. So if you want to blast music in your work place I'm very okay with that, especially if it's 90s alt rock. What I'm not okay with is an employee who doesn't even attempt to speak up when you ask a question. He stood there looked at me with the dumbest face and mumbled his response. What was my question? I asked, \"Do you guys still make the hot dog and Mac and cheese one\" his response, \"yeah\". Couldn't hear him but I assumed that's what he said. My girlfriend ordered the Reggie. And then he looked at me waiting for me to order and I said the hot dog and Mac and cheese one we just spoke about. He then mumbled the order total, couldn't hear him again so I just handed him my card. The wait. 20 minutes for 2 calzones. As we waited I watched the beautiful machine at work. 6-7 guys all of them college aged walking around some of them half asleep some of them couldn't care less what they were doing, if one of them was a manager I sure as hell couldn't tell. So we waited and waited and waited and waited. And finally the food came!!!The food. Okay so I'm pretty sure the people that work at this dp dough have never seen a calzone before because the thing was more breading than meat. The thing was flat, burnt, had holes in it, and it was guess what, not what I ordered. Instead of the hot dog and Mac and cheese I was given the pulled Pork and Mac and cheese... So this all could have been avoided if the guy working the counter A. Cared about his job B. Spoke up in a loud room C. Wasn't apathetic about his job D. Had any sense of manners E. Wasn't hung over or possibly stoned. Or F. All of the above. The answer is F and that's what I give this rotten hole of an establishment. I will never return and I will do everything in my power to dissuade people from coming to this place. I guess I was spoiled in Normal with, you know a DP dough that didn't suck complete and total ass.",

This was mainly due to the fact that it was pretty cheap, close to my apartment, and satisfied every drunken desire that I had. Because I went there so often, I knew what worked for me and what did not work for me. I was a big fan of the Black & Blue (tastes like a burger with blue cheese), the mangus (pesto and pepperoni), the titan (pesto and pineapple), and the buffer zone (blue cheese, hot sauce, etc). There was only one or two times where I was not completely satisfied with any of these. My friends were all big fans of the Barbecue Chicken zone. I have eaten it twice. The first time I was less than satisfied because of all the hype, but the second time I was happy with my decision. For the most part, the calzones were delicious. There were a couple times where they may have been a little undercooked, but I preferred that over being burned to a crisp.As for cons, there are times where the service is very slow. This is mainly because as a \"drunk food\" establishment, people normally order between the hours of 1-3 AM, when this place is bumpin'. It will generally take 30-45 minutes when you order at this time to get your food so plan accordingly otherwise you will be forced to observe the happenings at Green Street Cafe. Other issues people may have with the staff. I would not say that any interaction I have had has been particularly friendly, but I always just took that as how the environment there was.DP Dough was a large part of my collegiate experience and I have no regrets about all the money that I spent there.",

They have a big selection of calzones, and on the off chance you don't see one you like, you can also custom design one (known as \"Construction Zone\" where you can have up to 4 ingredients).  Personally, my mouth just waters whenever I look over the menu and have to remember that these things are very filling so I can't order the 5 different calzones I'd like to try.  I'm trying to work my way through the list, but so far my favorites include the Testing Zone (breaded chicken, pesto, mozzarella) and a combination of the Veggie Zone and Parking Zone (broccoli, breaded chicken, mushrooms, mozzarella).All the calzones are made fresh the moment you order them, are absolutely delicious, and only cost $6.  They're definitely perfect for when you need got the munchies, are studying late at night, or when you discover you're actually really hungry after a night out at the bars, and even better?  They deliver late!!!Monday - Wednesday until 2amThursday - Saturday until 3amSunday until 1amThey do lose some points for their turnover time though.  It takes them upwards of an hour to get the food delivered to you - the reason for which is because they need to make and bake your order first before they can get it out to you.  The plus side to this though, is that your calzone arrives fresh and piping hot with the cheese in the middle still oozing out when you take a bite.",

Now when I've also ordered a side salad, doesn't it REALLY make sense to include a fork at the least?At the suggestion of a co-worker, I called the store to let them know. The guy working at the time claimed that my two-for-two experiences with no fork/knife were \"the only two times he's ever heard of a customer not getting them\". Yea right.Goodbye DP Dough. You may dump loads of money into lame T.V. commercials, but your just-plain-OK food coupled with horrible logic and an apparent deficit of plastic forks and knives is unacceptable.P.S. According to my friends, the \"DP\" stands for double penetration... and that will likely be your experience with this place.",

Oh my gosh, DP Dough's calzones are good! Namely because I haven't had many opportunities to try calzones!We ordered three calzones that lasted for two days:Combat 'Zone (pepperoni, sausage, green pepper, mushroom & mozzarella) which was a solid calzone but not my favorite.End 'Zone (steak, onion, green pepper and mozzarella) that I wanted to steal from my boyfriend because it was technically his.Maui Wow (ham, pineapple & mozzarella) my favorite! You must get this!Each calzone was made with white flour, and came with a nice cup of tomato sauce that I wished was twice as big.The menu is huge so I plan to go back for more 'zones, and to try them made with the garlic crust.",

                "review": "We ordered delivery on a late-ish Saturday night through the online ordering system which was fairly easy to work.They have a wide variety of calzones and toppings to choose from. We ended up going with a \"double play\" which was 2 zones and cheese stix for about $16, although we added some options to our zones that increased their price by at least $1 each, also the tax, delivery fee and tip, this dinner ended up being pretty pricey at over $24.Delivery time itself was fairly quick, about 45 minutes. Our food was fairly hot and everything looked to be correct as far as what we ordered goes, which was a pepperoni & sausage zone as well as a maui wawi zone.I was not impressed overall, though. The zones themselves are a fairly large portion, with a crispy crust, but the insides were mostly cheese and the amount of meat wasn't nearly much as I expected. I also didn't like how the sauce comes on the side, more like a dipping sauce as opposed to a pizza topping. Not only did I run out of side sauce, but I feel like the entire inside of the zone was kind of bland due to being just meat and cheese. The meats were not that tasty, either, kind of lacking flavor, and probably not of high quality. The cheese stix we got with our order were just okay too, I did like the crispy bottom but they tasted quite similar to my zone.You can't deny DP Dough is ideal drunk food, but I didn't particularly care for it on a more sober Saturday night without any coupons or Hooked/local deals. I would have rather gotten a Papa Del's deep dish for comparable money.I think if this place narrowed their menu and focused more on simple, quality/fresh ingredients, I would probably give it another shot.",

When I called and ordered they told me it would take longer to deliver since I wasn't in their delivery area.  How does that make sense?  It is good, just hope you are in the delivery area, or its a good time for them to bring you what you order.  Heaven forbid a delivery place delivers when they are busy.",

We like Papa Del's, but it is pricey and takes forever to deliver, and although we like Jupiter's and Timpone's for a good thin crust, they are more involved than a simple good delivery or quick bite.Stepping into that gap, my wife and I find Papa Murhpy's convenient and tasty. Their veggie delite is great. What I like about the pizza is that the toppings are good, particularly the ample fresh veggies. One of their pizzas has a garlic sauce that we also like.Maybe it's just me, but these pizzas seem much less oily and overall slightly healthier than what we get when we order out, and of course in baking ourselves get second to none freshness.So, we've had great experiences here and really enjoyed the flavors, and also feel that we've ate (slightly) healthier and saved some money. It also doesn't hurt that we're a mile away and we can grab one on a trip to Schnuck's.",

Can't argue with that.unlike most other pizza places the size of their pies has not shrunk over time to try to garner more profits but the prices have gone up, but I can get an easy to modify pizza with a variety of toppings and they don't charge me an extra $2 per change like some other places.Yeah, it's not instantly hot and I have to cook it at home but that is what makes it so you can get a huge pizza for the price of a tiny pizza from pizza hit.Papa Murphy's has a life long customer in me.",

There's a gourmet vegetarian option with artichoke hearts and spinach that's great as well.  They have good fresh salads and cookie dough for sale also.  Service went downhill there for awhile-they had some downright sullen people in there who used to get upset with us if we came in a half hour before closing, because they were wanting to clean up for the night.  But those employees seem to be gone and everyone is very nice again.  Prices are very reasonable and the food is of high quality.  A winner!",

                "review": "Party of 12 on a Saturday? Lets try BW in Savoy... oh wait, it's a UFC night. They didn't even offer a wait time, just sort of laughed and were like \"yeah right\". So, we're like \"where do you want to go?\" looked around (while standing outside bw) and there's restaurants all over the place. How about the BBQ place right next to Tucks... \"i don't like bbq\" why not \"i don't like bbq\" THEY HAVE OTHER THINGS!!! Applebees? It's right there... no... geebus... how about... (name every restaurant)... finally... BRIXX. She calls, yes, we can get in. Whoo hoo a decision!!!Drive down the street, drive around the building a couple times, hoping to find a parking spot. That may be the worst thing about BRIXX, is the parking is terrible. Go inside, seated right away. Oddly, only know 1 person who was working there, and she was the hostess (i believe). Menu's are passed. Beer list is perused. Hey, look, there's always a Triptych on tap. That's great. The draft list is all craft, and that's awesome. There are no macros on tap. I assume this is upsetting to many people the first (maybe only?) time they go there. \"What do you mean you don't have bud light on tap???\" I'd assume is asked by crusty old people. \"Back in my day, a restaurant would have Budweiser, Miller, Coors AND Pabst on tap! I suppose I can't even get a HAMM'S in here?!?!?!\" Hey, whaddyaknow, they have macros in bottles. \"Well, why didn't you tell me that?\"  Craft food deserves craft beer. The lady and I both order the Triptych, the Blue and the Gold. She believes it tastes better than when it was at the brewery, so that's odd. Beer is promptly served. It doesn't appear that it was in a frosty pint glass either, so that's good too. There is also craft rootbeer on tap, so that's cool. They seem to have some staples in intro craft, like Fat Tire, Sam Adams, but the list is nice. It's not going to be a place to go to for \"I've never even HEARD of this beer\" (from the craft beer drinkers) but the BMC drinkers will be exclaiming that, except in anger. I order the 4x4. So does the lady. The manager brings over a Mediterranean salad, apparently an extra one had been made, and he decided to bring it to our table (he must know i'm a yelper!... or maybe he's just nice). Bill eats the salad. Courtney eats the bread, she seemed to like the bread. Others at the table ordered other things. Court got the ravioli, the waitress was awesome and asked if she wanted the tomatoes on it, and court was like no. The waitress was awesome, did i mention that. She was like \"i'm a picky eater too, and you look like you'd be a picky eater\" which was really nice. There were 2 young boys in our group, and they went over and drew on the chalkboard, and one of the bussers brought them out extra chalk to draw with, and that was really nice. Man, those people were really nice. The pizzas come out. I devour mine. Apparently, the reason i don't really like pizza is the sauce. The 4x4 doesn't have red sauce, it's an olive oil. So, maybe that's why i don't like pizza. Who knew? I remember as a kid, eating some frozen pizzas, every now and then, one of those Tino's (or similar) would have a sauce that we would call \"watermelon pizza\". I also hate pizza hut. As a youth, when John and I would drive around Pontiac, we'd sometimes eat at pizza hut. Well, we'd drink... sometimes too much. It was then that i discovered the acidity in the pizza hut sauce is almost exactly the same acidity that is regularly in my stomach. So, when i'd throw up from drinking too much, it would taste exactly the same. As an adult, I don't drink to that point. So, the 4x4 was amazing. I don't do desert. Kansas was losing the first half of the game while I was there. I leave and they win by like 20, wtf? Tres Tinkle was having a great first half. I leave and suddenly Kansas remembers how to play?The 3 bean salad was great. Not a typical three bean salad either. Red beans, black beans and garbanzos (i realize everyone poops, but that doesn't mean i want to see chick pee's!)",

First, we were seated at a table directly in front of the swinging kitchen door. Upon being seated an emplyeed barreled out the door and smack into me. Then we ordered the Brixx Sticks and got them after about 20 minutes, first we thought they were cheese filled because the middle was gooey, then we realized our Brizz Sticks were basically raw. Sent them back and asked for new, upon waiting another 20 minutes we got our pizza...still no Brixx Sticks. We told our server just take them off the bill, the woman training our server did not like that and tried to convince us to take them to go even though we told her we didnt want them anymore as we already got our meal. Lastly, the pizza was undercooked and dry. My husbands pizza was significantly smaller than mine, all the pizzas are supposed to be 10\". He order his pizza without goat cheese and they put in on the pizza anyway. A friend of our was supposed to be running this place but passed away shortly before open. We really wanted to love this place, but we will probably never go back. The staff seamed nice but the food just wasn't cooked.",

                "review": "For being a pizza-rich town, we've been surprisingly short of wood-fired options. Now all of a sudden there are two, maybe a third on its way in downtown. This one is a franchise and doesn't surprise me that it's a bit mediocre. We tried it out after its first month of being open, figuring the kinks would be shaken out by then. It was a busy football night, but late, after the initial dinner crowd was winding down. We were seated by the hostess then abandoned for about 20 minutes, even though the place was not so busy that all the tables were filled. She was just distracted yakking with a pal. When finally discovered about to leave, we were assigned a harried but competent waitress (who was tipped well for catching up for us). No obvious manager around, and certainly not the type that would pitch in and clean the messed-up bathroom or pick up paper or other droppings on the floor near us.Anyway, the whole premise of a wood-fired oven seems like false advertising, because it looks like there's a gas flame burning in the back of that oven, with a small pile of wood thrown on the side to dress it up. And the results are not really up to what one expects from this style of preparation. The crust is not as thin and lightly prepared as classic neopolitan, and of the two pizzas we ordered, one was decently charred, the other pale an unfinished. That was the margherita, which can be excused for its drab tomatoes for this region and season, but the cheese should have been closer to a fresh buffala style rather than low moisture and stretchy/chewy.The appetizers were fine, really enjoyed the hummus and crust \"chips\", and the caesar salad was also fine. But overall this is not the wood-fired pizza destination I wish it would be. Sure, we can't expect a Pizzeria Bianco in this sized town, but something as good as Settebello Pizzeria Napoletana (Henderson NV) should be possible. So far, the best option is actually the Dragonfire pizza truck, but they also have some issues with not quite \"getting it\". But they do have a really good crust going, and you can't go wrong with their basic pepperoni pizza.",

This is a shared parking lot with Moe's.... it's kind of like that parking lot up at the Starbucks on Prospect.... small and narrow.... so you have two fairly middle-of-the-road chain restaurants sharing a one lane parking row.   I'm already off to a bad experience here.   As you walk in, it is actually very nice.... lots of seating and a clear view of the wood-burning oven.  The menu is fairly large --- lots of choices for all types of palettes -- salads, appetizers, pastas and pizzas.   The waitresses are friendly and they were hamming it up with my five-year old son, who was supplied with crayons and a little booklet.   He loves pineapple on his pizza so he put in the order for a Hawaiian pizza and I ordered a greek-like salad.     The waitress brought water and my first sip, there was a little piece of clear plastic floating in it... yuck.  Don't know what that was about but it seemed harmless.  The food came about 10 minutes later and the salad was huge.... with a huge chunk of bread.   I ate about half of it and took the rest home.   The pizza came out --- it was about 10 inches, cut into six slices.   The crust was thin and foldable....which I like, but it was fairly tasteless.... there wasn't any tomato sauce on it, and am not sure if the description said it was a sauce-less pie or not... but my son didn't seem to mind it.... he was just happy about having pineapple and ham (or prosciutto to be more specific) on his pizza!   My real gripe about this pizza was the amount of cheese.... it was so much.   It was gooey and melty which was a good thing, but there was this layer of grease sitting on top of the pie which was off-putting and made it very salty....We easily finished it because we were pretty hungry and frankly, it isn't that much better than Papa John's or Jet's.... just lighter (in terms of crust and texture) but just the same amount of greasiness.   I would choose this place over Monical's...but it still ranks in the low-mid range of pizza places in town.    My top 5 list is still:  Dragon Fire, Antica Pizza, Pizza M, Jet's and Papa Del's.   I still haven't tried Azzip so that's why it's not on the list..... the bottom 3 of my list are in no particular order, it just depends on what style of pizza I want.",

                "review": "Our small family tried Brixx tonight. We love wood-fire brick-oven pizza. Two of us had the pizza and one of us tried the meatball sub with black bean salad. We also tried the Korean bbq meatball appetizer, and I had a Brixx house salad as a side. Neither pizza lover gave Brixx pizza top marks. The crust was not especially crispy. The blackening on the bottom lent a bitter flavor. To the good, the ingredients were high quality. I loved the pear-gorgonzola topping with walnuts and carmelized onions, although the onions were sauteed at best and not at all carmelized (they were out of the butternut squash-goat cheese pizza, so this was my second pick). The more traditional cheese pizza was just passable. The Korean bbq meatball appetizer did not taste Korean (and I'm a Korean food lover), and came with pineapples chopped up as a garnish -- it didn't go with the flavor profile of the meatballs, but it didn't fight against it either. The meatballs were tender and tasty in a generic way. The side salad was good, too, with goat cheese and pistachios. It hadn't been seasoned and the dressing wasn't balanced (too little acid in the vinaigrette). The meatball sub could not be held, and that's a pet peeve of ours. If you can't pick it up, it's not a sandwich. The toppings were somewhat off-putting in terms of texture, but the meatballs were good, with Italian seasoning. The bean salad side received a 7.2 out of 10. Good but not great.The music was on too loud and the tables were not well cleared or cleaned. Our waitress was the only one on duty when we arrived and the place was filling up, but there seemed to be a lot of other staff. She was good and friendly, but overtaxed. The place has double sets of doors, but the inside doors were open. Hard to know why. Restaurant staff should be aware that this lets in flies, and sure enough, it did.We didn't feel cheated, but we probably won't be back.",

We both ordered water and a pizza. I got the artichoke hearts veggie option and my husband got the Caribbean jerk pizza. We then sat there unattended until a different server brought out our pizzas. I asked him to bring our drinks and he apologized and got them. The pizzas looked good visually when delivered but there was a lot of crust as I ate and my toppings were not evenly spread. Two of the pieces literally had no artichoke on them. My husband said his was not much better. The sauce on the Caribbean jerk pizza was not evenly spread so not every bite was flavorful. The crust was not good by itself so we both had a pile of crust at the end. We did not see our server again, but the waiter that delivered our food and drinks stopped to see if we needed anything else. I asked for the check and he asked who our server was. I told him I did not know. The server then reappeared and the checks aid his name was Sam G. We paid and left. Truly disappointed in the food and service.",

The price was right. I got the lunch special, 1/2 pizza and 1/2 salad, which is available Monday-Friday between 11am-3pm for $7.95. Great value. I had the mediterranean salad and rustica pizza. Both were outstanding! Definitely recommend. Some reviewers seem to be complaining that there wasn't any sauce on the pizza.. Read the menu before you order. If there is a hollow yellow circle next to the item, the crust is brushed with olive oil. If there is a red filled in circle, the crust has traditional red pizza sauce. The manager was very visible and friendly. My only complaint, and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is where we were seated. The place was virtually empty, but we were seated in a booth right next to the entrance. The restaurant phone kept ringing quite loudly directly behind me. Something to keep in mind for those in charge.",

I had the rustica pizza without olives, which was tasty. Pretty generous on the toppings but I do think the mushrooms were underdone and they appeared almost raw to the eye. I also thought the whole cloves of garlic were a little excessive even though I love garlic. The Bronx bomber pizza was pretty good as well and again, generous with toppings. They have a really wide variety of different pizzas so pretty much anyone can find something they like. Aside from the food, our server was extremely friendly and helpful. Overall a good experience, don't know if I would make an effort to go back, but it's definitely not a bad choice if you're in the mood for pizza.",

Their Left Hand Stout is also excellent. A local micro brew also supplies great offerings. Champaign has some great pizza offerings. Brixx thin crust brick oven pizza is unique.

Out of all those times Sam has been out server at least 3. He was honest, helpful, friendly, fast and just all around a great server. One time we went and the kitchen was having a struggle bus day. They messed up both our pizzas! Mine was remade once and still they forgot the goat cheese. My husbands was remade 4 TIMES And still wasn't right... We ordered menus items with no customization, so I think the kitchen was just having a bad day. They were very nice about it and so where we. The manager was there that day, but we didn't talk to him. I have tried almost all the meat free options and all are amazing! My husband loves the 4x4, which is sauce free, but surprisingly good. They make the mozzarella in house and it's so good!!! The beer selection is pretty good too. We trie the root beer on tap too. I would highly recommend that!

The kids menu was very good, and my kiddos just love their pizza and pasta at Brixx. What is more, they will give each kid a ball of dough that they can shape to their pleasing and they will throw it in the oven, and out comes their own creation! Great idea!I have not found Brixx to be overwhelmingly busy. The ambience is outstanding!The only thing I might grade them down on was that getting to their parking wasn't easy, given construction.

Azzip pizza is basically identical for 1/2 the price.I will go back, but they have work to do.",

Either that or I was starving - probably the latter. The server was a bit pushy and had an attitude. After we ate, we played a few rounds of pool. At this point I probably would've gave this place 3 stars but it's what happened at the end of the night that completely turned my night sour. As we were leaving, a staff member came and started screaming bloody murder at us. I was stunned and asked my friends what was going on. From how she was acting you would've thought someone had gotten killed. Turns out my friend forgot to pay for pool. She was out her damn mind yelling at us like she was crazy! The way this woman acted was completely rude and unprofessional. There are numerous ways she could've dealt with this situation and the way she chose was completely and utterly unacceptable. Honestly don't know how this place is still in business. Wish I could give this place 0 stars. Yeah, it's THAT bad. I will NOT be coming back!!",

They had a TV set up all ready with the niners game when I got there.There are peanut shells all over the ground, which I find a little tacky and dangerous. The Pizza was pretty decent - thin crust. We ordered the Hawaiian although we substituted BBQ sauce for regular pizza tomato sauce.There are fun pool tables and other arcade games. A jukebox for your favorite tunes can be found near the bar, i think.This place seems to be a staple of downtown champaign.",

So my main complaint about the lunch dining experience is sanitation. I ordered the burger the first time and a hot dog the second. I guess some people don't mind having a communal condiments station but I have a problem with this. The fresh produce like pickles, onions, and lettuce are not refrigerated at all at the communal condiments station. I mean at least puts some cold ice under the box of pickles, lettuce, and onions at least! The ketchup bottle and mustard container all looked like it was ready for the dump. The tips were hardened and crustified and it just looked out of date because no one bothered to keep em clean. Stickyness galore. Wash your hands if you still decide to go. Anyway, minus food but fun joint. Proceed with caution cuz after a few beers you might just make a drunk order of food and realize you got yourself into a bigger mess then you had planned.",

On more than one occasion this man acts as if we are in his way rather than welcoming us as guests. Last time we were there he was in a particularly bad mood, being nasty to his fellow workers and acting as if the patrons were in his way. I come to a bar to have a relaxed fun evening, Rich has more than once made the evening very uncomfortable.I have been in the bar when Rich wasn't working, and when he is not there the people behind the bar are relaxed, they smile, and seem to have fun, but when Rich is there everyone is on edge and grumpy. God forbid anyone does anything in his \"territory\", they get a nasty look. This man is more worried about making sure that everything behind the bar is in its place and perfect, than he is about giving good service to his customers, he will walk by an empty glass many times without asking if you need another drink, you have to flag him down.I think he has been there much too long, and has lost the knowledge that the customer comes first.",

Plus, the deals! 18 Asian dumplings for around 5-6 dollars? Delicious black bean burger for about 5 bucks? Gin and tonic (my standard drink) for less than 4 bucks? What is not to love?Add in the great service, the nice sized televisions for sporting events, pool tables that I am dying to try, and quiet music so we can actually talk to each other and hear ourselves think, and I'm still kicking myself for only checking this place out now. Plus free peanuts! I LOVE FREE PEANUTS. Now, granted, this was a rather quiet Thursday, so we'll have to see what happens if/when it gets busy. But so far, all systems go.",

                "review": "This will be a review down memory lane.  I grew up in this bar, much like Jackie H's review.  One of the bartenders was my little league baseball coach, then I played on the bars soft ball team.  Even though I have not lived in Chamaign for about 10 years, I can still find people I know, and bartenders that remember me.When I was little I would order kiddy cocktails from the bar, then get change to play on the only pinball machine.  Then stomp on all the peanut shells on the floor.  I have seen expansion many times.  Originally from one bar and a few booths, to a wrap around bar, then finally to the pool hall and extra bar area that you see now.  I have met U of I basketball coaches here, there are pictures of former Cubs players kissing my Mom (wait, what).  My parents originally met here.  It is safe to say my family has a mullti generational history here.Anyway, beyond the nostalgia, it is one of the best pubs to visit in the downtown area.  Just a great place to relax and have a few drinks.  Along with the evolution of the bar, so has the menu.  Now there is a mix of pub grub like burgers, fish sandwiches, etc.  Which I don't think are that great.  Though the various pizzas are very good.  As are the wings, which I am not typically a fan of.  Though these are baked, not fried and battered like most.  The Asian Dumplings are great as well.  The service can be hit or miss.  Depending on the time you come, and where you order.  Bar service is pretty good, but the waitresses can be a bit confused when trying to find you after you place the order.  Though they work hard, and always take care of anything that might be wrong.Drinks are pretty standard.  There are a handful of good micros on tap.  Usually something from Two Brothers or Dark Horse as the main micros available on tap.  A bit more extensive selection in bottles.  The rest is typical drinks for a neighborhood bar.Overall, not perfect.  Though the goods far out way the bad.  An institution in the downtown Champaign area, and a place I will always love.",

They're just shots of pineapple infused tequila and even my friends who hate tequila seem to love them.I also really like this bar because they have some good bar food (lots of fried stuff) and they serve fried food pretty late. This place is also big, so it can feel busy without being shoulder-to-shoulder like some bars. It's just an all around nice place for a chill night or a party with a big group. Probably one of my favorite bars in Champaign. Just make sure you have your ID because they WILL card you!UPDATE: The jukebox is now gone. I am not happy.",

I would not put Esquire on that list.The decor is uninteresting at best. There is no personality. It's designed to appeal to a crowd that just wants a nice bright place to hang out and drink.Not being a drinker, I can't rate the Esquire on that, but I can rate them on the food, and the food is so forgettable, I forgot to review it. Our group had a couple of burgers, some wings, and a chicken sandwich. I was told the burgers were good. The chicken must be avoided at all costs.The sandwich is one of those strange creations that takes chicken strips and puts them on a bun. I'm not entirely sure why, as this makes an awkward eating experience. The strips were nearly tasteless. Thank goodness for mayonaise. My wife had the wings. After one or two, she was trying to figure out why they didn't seem right. I was going to eat them, but I couldn't, and I LOVE wings. These things had enough salt to turn Lake Michigan into a salt lake. They were awful.  I would not go back at all. I'll eat diner food, fast food, and other kinds of food, but not Esquire Food. Meh.",

It's a great place to watch sports games and the prices are quite reasonable for the amount of food they serve.

It was a Saturday night, when the bar is super crowded.  We were a group of 4, and as always finding parking spots on downtown Champaign can be a such a chore in weekends. Anyway, you order your food to the bartenders. Waiting for the bartender to notice you in a crowded bar could be ok if you want to order a beer or shot, but for food? I don't like the idea. I ordered a Greek Pizza, while the aforementioned friend ordered a garden pizza (I can't remember the name now, but it was their vegetarian pizza) . To be honest, I dodn't like either of them. The Greek one was a disaster. It had clusters of feta cheese spread over a thin crust, and almost nothing else. It was supposed to have sausage, but I couldn't taste any. The vegetarian one, although being the better one, was kind of juicy. A juicy pizza is NOT my favorite. I'm not against non-American-style thin crust pizzas. As a matter of fact, I love Jupiter's pizzas. But these ones, well, you heard me. There should be a reason these were so cheap (I guess around $7), and I now know it.",

This place is right across the street from the station. I sat by myself at the bar, but there were plenty of others riding solo as well. It was THAT kind of place - where the locals can come and drown away their sorrows. Actually, it was much more than that - this place seems to have a little bit of everything. There are pool tables in the back, so you can get that sort of crowd. There are larger tables as well, so you can see some large groups of students gabbing away. There are a good amount of TV's, so there were some people watching the evening college football games. There are decent sized booths, so I saw a couple people typing away on laptops. And there's a jukebox, so some people are silently rocking out to the classics. And perhaps best of all, there were plenty of townies around for some great people watching. At one point of the locals who had clearly had too much to drink began serenading a nearby booth with the Canadian National Anthem. Although he didn't get the words right, I gave him an A+ for effort. The bartenders called the guy a cab and made sure he got home okay. It felt like I was inside some sort of insider club where everybody is friends, and even the students are cool with the townies.The beer selection was surprisingly good. There were a lot of good import options available, although I stuck with $2.25 Bud Light drafts. Remember, I was taking the Amtrak home, so that shows you how much money I wanted to spend.... They have $1.50 PBR drafts too, which is what the locals stuck to. The food was pretty good as well. I had a simple cheeseburger and fries. Although not my favorite burger/fries combo, it was definitely worth the $4.50 I paid. The \"fixin's table\" they have is nothing more than onions, pickles, and tomatoes next to some condiments and sauces - Nothing special there. But there was something cool about being able to put that stuff on yourself, I guess.The charm of this place lies in the characters that visit, and for that alone, I am giving a 5 star rating. The cheap food and beer is an added bonus. And I almost forgot, free peanuts! If I return to Champaign any time soon, I will definitely be back to this place.",

The main problem is that it doesn't have great beer.  It is pretty townie and older for the most part, which is actually kind of nice coming from the Pig or M+Ms, and it does have a decent unpretentious neighborhood vibe (despite not being in a neighborhood).  They do have pineapple infused tequila they make themselves, which is delicious, so make sure to order a contusion.It's a fairly versatile place, good for happy hours.",

Cheap drinks, good service, pool, and TVs everywhere; what more could you ask for?!I love the peanuts thing they do, and I love the whole feel of throwing the shells on the floor! I feel like a rebel for making a mess, hehe. Their fries are wonderful to chow down on when you're feeling pretty happy, and their honey mustard is ridiculously good (not sure what kind they use, but I need that in my life!). I was a little disappointed they didn't have Bulleit bourbon, but it could just be a southern thing. I got over it quickly, Makers is a good substitution in my Old Fashioneds. Two thumbs up for Esquire! Will definitely be back next time I'm visiting Champaign",

I ordered the portabella mushroom sandwich (super bland), my sister got the chicken salad (she said it was pretty good), and my mom ordered the salmon.Overall the food was nothing special to me however coming from the city to this little suburb area the price for the food was pretty amazing. The salmon only cost $7 and it was a fairly big portion. The servers were nice but the atmosphere was too load. I wont be back here but that mostly has to do with the lack of food options.",

Esquire has grown and changed (a bit) over the years to accomodate the changes in downtown Champaign, but it still retains much of its original character.  I think it and the Brass Rail are the only two places left where you can really hang with the hardcore downtown alcoholics.  I mean HARDCORE!  Esquire is awesome!",

Its journeyman efforts will win friends and a few high fives, but it is not the flashy varsity letterman. Food here is just fine, and very reasonably priced. I have been disappointed with the size of their appetizers once or twice, but their entrees are a solid value, cooked dependably to be exactly what you expect in pub grub. Prices are very good for downtown Champaign, but they lack the booze selection of a Radio Maria or Blind Pig. The gross looking jar on the bar is infused vodka.Service is always friendly, and fastest at the bar. If you sit at their pretty awesome outside tables, the trade off is that you're gonna get ignored. You can order lunch ahead and pick up 15 minutes later. The free peanuts are priceless, as are the friendly patrons who are more likely than other crowds in town to strike up a convo with you. All this sounds pretty complimentary, but the fact is that this place is not stand-out awesome in any particular way. If you want to take your friends from Chicago to visit 4 places in downtown Champaign that are all different from each other, to give them an idea of what the \"new\" Champaign has to offer, you aren't going to stop at Esquire. Of course, that's just fine with me. I'll at the end of the bar eating peanuts and saying to some dude I just met holy shit the White Sox sure are Cubbing it hard this September.",

It somehow manages to straddle the line in such a way that nobody really seems to feel out of place there.  The burgers are some of the best in Champaign.  They have a good char-grilled taste to them that so many other, more pretentious, places lack.  There are a large number of sides to select from, including fried mushrooms, onion rings, french fries, potato chips (which, sadly, just come from a bag), fried broccoli, and Asian dumplings (which my friends tell me are fantastic).  I've had the polish sausage once, and it was passable, but nothing special.  The pizza is good and comes in a number of varieties.The one complaint I have is that the service can be especially hit-and-miss.  There have been times I've been served wonderfully, and there have been times I've been ignored for a half-hour just to refill my drink.Overall, Esquire is a down-to-earth place with good prices and good food.",

So on Saturday I ordered one --- Sausage Cheese and Mushrooms..  I have traveled from Coast to Coast - my dad loved tasking me to a place in chicago and spending upwards of 80.00 on what is known as Chicago's Famous Pizza ... Can't touch Esquire Lounge Pizza --- Too Bad I don't drink... So (5) Star!   When I walked in the female bar attendant ingnored me TOTALY - Then a kind gentleman from the back came over drying his hands - all smiles and was California Kind! Sorry I did't tip him... But the female waitress had me SHOCKED! This is 2015 -  THIS PLACE WILL SEE ME AS OFTEN AS I WANT A SNACK! LOL! HAPPY !",

The place is dirt cheap and the food is simple and good. 1.50 pints of old style and 3 dollar grilled cheese sandwiches make this place my cheap go to in Champaign. They also have free peanuts which are good when you are too cheap to buy the cheap food, like I am sometimes. It's a bit of an old man bar but the cheapness makes up for it in my mind. Also, they have a number of large pool tables. The place can be pretty packed on a Fri or Sat night as well so it makes for a good time.",

Otherwise, the spirits and beer selections are okay. It's about on par with the rest of the downtown bars (similar to Jupiters, for instance). The pool space is nice and open as well. I'm not a huge fan of the aesthetic (my inner OCD hates the peanut shell on the floor schtick) but it's a pretty good bar.The food, on the other hand, has been consistently underwhelming. I haven't tried the pizza yet, but that's because I've been unimpressed by the other stuff I have tried. The appetizers tend to be greasy, and the chicken fingers were weak. Plus food normally takes forever to come out of the oven.In short, come for the booze, but eat beforehand.",

It's also the place I had my first legal drink, the place I arranged my first (extremely underwhelming) one-night stand, the place I had my first post-breakup talk ... the list goes on and on. In short, the Esquire is a place of firsts for me, and for that reason it holds an unimpeachable place in my heart.It's a good place, even taking none of the above into account. The prices are reasonable, the service is friendly, the drinks are stiff, the food is tasty, the jukebox kicks much ass (except on one night a few years back when some doucherocket fed about a million dollars into the machine and played Pogues records all night, but I am willing to let bygones be bygones). There's a nice array of seating options: small tables, mid-size tables, large booths, and the bar itself, which is the best place to sit if you want super-fast service and a good vantage point for eavesdropping and people-watching. There are also some tables outside, which are nice places to park your ass if you're a smoker or like keeping an eye on the goings-on along Walnut. The outdoors is heated during chilly weather, and although it doesn't too a ton of good in the dead of winter, it's lovely on brisk autumn nights.The people who frequent this place are an interesting mix. Some townies, some students, some regulars, some noobs. You're just as likely to see a gaggle of hipsters looking vaguely out of place as you are to see a group of middle-aged business types in dad jeans. Every once in a while some truly fresh and interesting personalities will be present, such as a trio of cackling cougars sipping pineapple margaritas and flirting with any male under the age of 26, or two sharply-dressed men having a snappy but ultimately friendly conversation you ache to be a part of, or a crusty old man with a walrus mustache who will pound your table with a hammy fist and yell something that sounds friendly but is completely unintelligible. Oh, and every once in a while Tim Lash of Hum fame will be hanging around, which I think we can all agree is pretty delightful. (I do not advocate drunkenly pestering him, of course, but if you do want to say hi be assured that he's about the nicest dude on earth and will receive your attention with much grace and warmth.)One of the best, most endearing things about this bar is its all-around friendliness. I often go here by myself in the evening with whatever book I'm currently reading, fold myself into a corner, and order a few beers. Not once has any patron or staff member given me grief over this, and for that I am truly grateful. Yes, the linoleum is hideous and yes, the bathrooms are a little iffy, but all the bartenders remember my name, and that's something that can't be beat.",

You could say I grew up throwing peanut shells on the floor and stomping on them. (For the record, I still throw the shells on the floor, but I no longer do the accompanying dance--that stopped being cute around age eight.) Before my family moved away from Champaign, this was the number one place we would take out of town relatives visiting. Even as objectively yummier, cooler places opened up around town, Aunt So-and-so and Uncle Whatshisface would always demand to be taken back to Esquire, and we were always happy to oblige. It's a comfortable, unpretentious bar, and that's what you needs sometimes.It's all about the ambiance, really. There are better burgers in town, but at Esquire it's the whole package that keeps me coming back. That and those peanuts. For real.",

She had been to Esquire before and said the burgers were good.  I really like the place.  I had the chicken tender sandwich with fries, and it was FABULOUS.  Everything a fried chicken finger sandwich could be.  At first it was delivered to the table empty, just a bun and chicken fingers.  But then I was told of the \"Fixin's Table\" where I got to add my own lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, and a sauce(s) of my choosing. I enjoyed sitting outside and watching the people walk by.  And when my other friend showed up with her dogs, they didn't mind at all.  And she loved that they had Fat Tire on tap.Overall, I would definitely recommend this place.  The only problem with sitting outside is that you do not get to throw your peanut shells on the floor- you have to bring a bowl outside for the shells... ah well...  On those cold winter nights I can throw my shells on the floor inside.",

We were also looking for something with a \"college\" feel considering its a college town and we are about 10 years out of college. Nostalgia gets me every time. This place had a much older crowd (on a Monday)...think 45 year old regulars, but what do you expect on a Monday night? The draft beer selection was ok. They have one Bell's, Guiness and Harp on tap, but that's as \"crafty\" as it gets at the front bar (the back bar was closed and may have had more available). The food was only OK. We got a small personal pizza and a steak sandwich. Neither one was that great. The staff was super friendly and GREAT with the kids. The price was also right.",

My friends and I frequent this place throughout the week. Wednesday's are GREAT for trivia with Abbi and the pizza is an amazing complement. I would recommend the Abbi (a divine concoction topped with a fried egg), the Sugar Bear (sausage and maple syrups), or the Deluxe! Sharing a location, The Flying Machine Cafe is also great. They make a wonderful chai tea and mocha, and have a great assortment of vintage sodas, wines and beer. You cannot go wrong!",

That out of the way, I love this place. Great location in the heart of downtown Urbana with tasty and fairly priced pizza. I eat their often and have tried all of their different pizzas and never had a bad experience. I never found the employees here inadequate. The negative reviews for this place make me curious as to what people are expecting. This is an extremely casual dining environment and I think expecting some sort of service similar to having someone wait on your table is silly. I've never had any trouble ordering a pizza or having it take too long. Granted, I always expect it to take at least 40 minutes since their literally making you a pizza from scratch. Yes you are expected to clear your own table, and maybe that's an issue for some, but it isn't for me. I've never noticed any sort of \"holier than thou\" attitude from either the employees or the patrons. Not sure where the hate is coming from, but this is a really great place to get some pizza and one of the best restaurants in the area.",

The place mostly consists of a large galley (reservable back room for small events) with long tables & bench seating. It's a malleable space but the acoustics are terrible. It's usually loud & the sound echoes terribly, so it's not conducive of conversation or studying. However, the pizzas are tasty & the staff is friendly.",

Only three stars because although the food was decent, it was just not that filling for the price, the iced tea was average at best, the environment was not the most comfortable, and the server didn't even bring the condiments (cheese, red pepper flake, sriacha sauce, tabasco sauce) to our table, even though there were a ton of carriers. The environment was so bad that it actually negatively impacted the taste of the food. This place was probably the most hipster restaurant I have ever been to though. It was actually kind of uncomfortable. They had all jars in lieu of real cups, a sprawling and disorganized looking selection of brews and wines, an ad for \"bring your own vinyl night\", and clearly very hipster clientele. These were not like nice hipsters either. They were the stereotypical of uppity better-than-thou hipsters. My cousins and I clearly didn't belong, but we kept on getting mean-mugged and got dirty looks, ironically from dirty looking hipsters. It is a shame cause I actually thought their flavor combinations on the menu looked really interesting, but the rest of the environment really detracted from the experience for me. There were four of us, we killed two whole pizzas, and were still hungry afterwards, so we needed to go get a second dinner.",

Apparently, even writing down the other two orders was too much for her to also write down my order and submit them at the same time. The persons in my group all looked at each other like, \"What just happened?\". Another person in my group grabbed the ordering pad and pen she left behind and started to write their own order down for her. Of course, she never returned so I'm not sure what happened to the poor girl. Finally a guy came into the room and took my order and then brought all the pizzas out when they were done. So, the service was a bit disappointing to begin. The pizza itself was alright, but I've had much better elsewhere. I'll give them another try to see if it's better the second time and hope that the service is also a better experience.",

The pizza quality has not slipped and it seems like they worked out a lot of the issues with the two different businesses occupying the same space. The employees are very helpful and professional. This summer, they've even offered ICE CREAM! and not your typical flavors. Tonight I had the chardonnay-strawberry ice cream which was absolutely delicious! It had a faint savory, almost cheesy taste and was like nothing I've ever tasted. Be patient with the employees. Sometimes, they dread ice cream orders since it means they have to go to the back cooler to scoop it out to order for customers.Also, I tried the lunch slices for the first time and found it to be delicious! It's different than their standard pizza. It's more like a heavily topped focaccia. Today's special slice had kalamata olives and gorgonzola - delicious!",

I have been in Champaign for over a year dealing with pizza from Papa Del and chain restaurants alike trying to find a good thin crust pizza with no avail. The recent Yelp event held here first of all opened my eyes to a pizza place in downtown. The pizza utilize unique fresh ingredients including sausage made in house. I was amazed by the selection of pizza including my favorite which was the Pizza M. It is a well hidden restaurant in the back of a coffee shop which is slightly confusing. They have to put up a larger sign to attract business and advertise more because it is quite a gem. Staff was super friendly and introduced you to each of the pizza's they had. This place easily beats the new Pizzeria Antica which touts the fire oven pizza. Crust is crunchy and stays that way even when you cut into the pizza. Overall quite an amazing selection and I will be back to try there other pizzas!Pros: fresh ingredients, house made sausage, friendly staffCons: Somewhat hard to find as it is hidden behind the coffee shop, still cost more than chain pizzasHidden deals: Did not see any special deals, maybe the owner should also think about pizza special nights to pull in more peopleHealth code rating: A http://champaign.il.gegov.com/champaign/estab.cfm?facilityID=1967",

They only take cash, and are only open on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights, so just keep that in mind. I think it's a good thing though. I treasure Pizza M that much more because of it. It may be more pricey than Dominos, but let's face it: Dominos in no way compares to Pizza M. It's worth every cent.Rumor has it Pizza M might be getting their own place soon, and hopefully extend their hours (hopeful thinking). I can't wait!Update*** Now Matt has his own store front. Pizza slices as well as a a full pie. What more can you ask for? Hands down, the best pizza place in town. Period.",

I liked how everything was set up. Drawn in, I talked to the register guy working there who seemed to be busy for a minute before acknowledging me waiting. I went ahead and ordered the special per recommendation... the Black Dog chicken with carolina red barbecue sauce. Only two sizes, a 14'' and 10'', but the 10'' is gluten free. Why? That doesn't make sense to me... can't they roll the dough just smaller for a 10'' and no individual slices were available. Anyways, I went ahead and ordered the 14'' pizza for $15. I was told afterwards the wait time would be 25 minutes... which is a long time for a pizza that's not deep dish. Whatever... When I got the pizza, I was somewhat excited after the 25 minute wait. I bit into the pizza and it was quite tasty at first, but as I took a few more bites, I began to regret my purchase. It was quite bland and dry for a barbecue pizza, had a bunch of veggies which is cool and all, but I was expecting more barbecue and more chicken. Don't advertise it as a barbecue chicken pizza when there's twice as many veggies as there is chicken. There was also waaaay to much crust... I don't mind crust normally but after eating three slices my jaw started hurting from how much crust I had to chew through. Overall, I'm not impressed. Seems like a cool place to hang out, grab a coffee, but I'm probably not coming back for the pizza.",

I was so impressed, I came back for lunch a week later. The toppings are fresh and very high quality. I think the price of $15 for a 14\" pizza is especially great considering the the high quality. I liked that the crust was thin and more chewy than crispy. The crust didn't hold up as well leftover and became a serious jaw workout. They have a pretty good beer selection which was a pleasant surprise. The drink prices are also comparable to other locations. It's about $5 for a good beer which is normal and I'm happy to pay that price.",

Pizzas will run you about $15 on average but you get a good amount and it's always delicious and hot. Heads up there are no slices! It's a thin crust establishment so be creative and try something new every time you go. The pizza isn't great overnight but if you can eat it cold the next day, it's not a bad breakfast to go. I know they are also very welcoming to other events and have hosted many a dance party in their private event area. The space itself is very open seating and very well lit for studying, which many people do. The chairs are kinda uncomfortable but that may be because I have 90 minute meals. Overall, I agree with my fellow Yelpers that this is a diamond in the rough. I would suggest hopping on the 5EGreen from campus and grabbing a pizza from here. Bonus points if you carry out and go eat in beautiful Carle park!",

We try to support local, non-chain restaurants as much as possible and this place is a prime example of the reason why. Great food at a reasonable price. I had a glass of wine while my husband had two beers. We ordered the meat and cheese plate while we were waiting for our \"kitchen sink\" pizza to go. The meat and cheese plate had a good variety of meats, cheeses, crackers, with a delicious jam and mustard and was well worth the $15 price tag. The owner (I believe) also came out and explained each item which was a pleasant surprise. We will definitely work this into our regular lineup. Oh... and the pizza was fantastic too.",

The best part about Pizza M is that you can get some coffee or pastry on the side. Or games! They have people do their game nights there, and it looks like a great idea.",

Completely lacking in flavor...1 bite of gorgonzola in the whole massive slice...no maple flavor at all...and the crust though tasty had no sauce to help me choke it down. I don't need it swimming but something to wet the mouth would have been appreciated. I'll give it another shot but first experience wasn't great. Oh, and my friends got their slices first while I waited for mine...restaurant 101...the whole table gets their food at the same time",

The atmosphere is very chill.  It doubles as a coffee shop, so you get a lot of students on their MacBooks just hanging out.  You order at the front, and the food is brought out to you, so it's very unintrusive (no wait staff).  You pay immediately, and if you want something else, you just go and get it.  The staff has always been very friendly, if not a little hipster.The food is very good for the price.  We usually stick to the basics, but the topping selection is pretty eclectic.  Would probably feel right at home in a larger city.  The beer selection is also good (Two Hearted, 60 Minute, etc.) and had Triptych as well (shout out to local brewers).   They also have some basic wines by the glass that are fairly priced.I still say that Papa Del's is the best pizza in town, but this is a great change of pace if you want a well made thin crust pizza (and don't want to overpay for an average Monical's pizza).Overall, I would definitely recommend it to anybody.  Glad this place is doing well and hope they stick around for awhile.",

It had kind of a zip to it and a little bit of zestyness.  Then I noticed that the sausage was terrific. He said that they made the sausage there.  It had a lot of flavor.  Overall, it was a fantastic pizza very flavorful with all the right textures and fresh ingredients.I'm kind of a pizza connoisseur and I would rate their pizza near the top of Champaign/Urbana's offerings.  Had some really intriguing pizzas on the menu. I believe that the pizzas were just a flat price of $15 and there are no small medium large there's just one size, which is kind of a refreshing thing...simplicity.  I will have to come back and try a different one.",

They said they would get right on it and have it delivered in 45 minutes... Screw that we said, we will pick it up (we would have canceled if it wasn't prepaid)  The employee said that would be fine, it will be ready in 30 minutes.....  Starving and upset, we decided to drive to Papa Johns early to give them intimidating, grumpy looks so perhaps we can get our pizza and bread sticks quicker.  Imagine our surprise though when we showed up 10 minutes later and our order was sitting done at the bottom of a pile of other finished orders.  We took it home and it was almost ice cold....   It probably had been sitting there for the last hour and a half...Most laughable though was our breadsticks.  They were literally balls of bread, and not even two were consistent in shape.  Small were tiny meatball sized, while others were like long sausages, and over there was another that was square in shape.  They also had literally no seasoning, were burnt, and just dough that had been baked pourly in a pizza oven.  I have had Papa John's breadsticks before, and this was a joke...  I will not be going here again.  Pizza is average at best anyways when the service actually manages to be good.",

As a college student it's a plus that the pizza is cheap . The ones in the Chicagoland area trade way better !

She did not welcome us, did not help us with our order (there was confusion over whether my boyfriend ordered under his full name or nickname), said there were no eatCU orders (not true), all she did was shrug and it was clear she just wanted us to leave. She kept shrugging and giving us SO MUCH attitude and it was upsetting that she didn't even care to help us. Sure it's a shitty job but you don't have to take it out on others :( Thankfully things were figured out by the manager but I do not ever want to go back if that same girl would give us service again.",

Sometimes the large pizza is $6 and sometimes it is $11. The crust is burnt half of the time. The pizza is sometimes warm and sometimes they give you garlic sauce with your pizza. Every time I order pizza from this place it's always a guessing game on to what will be wrong with the pizza. The management and employees don't seem to have great communication with each other.",

Because every local I know LOVES Monicals. It is, in fact, one of my must visit places every time I visit the twin cities.It's different from most of my favorite pizzas in that it's thin... ultra thin.  Crunchy crust, cut in squares, lots of cheese... it's a very tasty pizza.  However, the uninitiated may order this without knowing the best part of Monical's... the french dressing.  This seems odd (at least to all of my out of town friends in the past) but the way to eat Monicals is to get a bottle of the french dressing and dip the pizza in it.  I put the dressing directly on the top of the pizza myself... it's one of the oddest but best combos you will ever taste.  In fact, they even sell their french dressing online!  (And its worth it, because you will never find a dressing that good in stores.  Seriously, I've looked.)Grab the family pleaser (with salad and cola) and lube up your salad and pizza with copious amounts of french dressing... and thank me later.",

I would do anything for them to open one here (why not?!).  When I go home to visit, a Monical's trip is 100% part of the plan and when my P's visit me they bring it...and it's just as amazing after a 2.5 hour drive.Maybe as Joselyn H. says, it's because I was indoctrinated into loving this pizza from the mintue I could eat solids.  Actually, no.Perfectly cooked, super thin crust (may want to ask for them to cook it like 1 mintue longer than normal to ensure perfection).  Awesome sauce and topping of seasonings.  Love the sausage - fresh, not too big, not too spicy and definitely not manufactured looking (like Dominos or something).  Their breadsticks - while relatively plain as far as seasoning goes (just sea salt YUM) - are awesome and a staple to my order.  They also have the best \"red\" (French) dressing that is their own recipe...but I am a \"both\"er and think it's at it's best mixed with the ranch.  It's not the fanciest salad in the world, but like the simplistic breadsticks, it just works.  Oooh and a pitcher of fountain root beer is the perfect bev.Fast service, be ready to start eating the salad/breadsticks within minutes of ordering.  My parents say their prices have raised quite a bit, so that may be one downfall.Gimme some Family Pleaser now!!!  Mouth watering.",

French was spilled inside the bag, lid was not properly sealed and it covered the bread and left the container empty. Called about it and they are sending the driver back with a fresh order, 45 min later still nothing. The location is literally 4 miles from the house. Should not take this long to replace an item. Going to just go to the store for refund of the sauce and bread.",

However, the service is a bit challenged you could say... Our waiter forgot to get us water refills and forgot about our pizzarolles order or whatever they are called, but when we pointed it out, he compensated us really well, so no complaints really.I think the food deserves 5 stars, but since the service is so..... I don't know what to call it..... I had to knock it down a star.  Also, when my boyfriend mentioned that the pizzarolles were delicious but he thought he was going to have a heart attack from all the grease (haha funny funny), the waiter filled us in with how bad they are for us, like trying to make cool conversation with us.  It pretty much horrified us and made me want to starve myself for a week, but like I said, he compensated our bill well.",

Monical's was participating in a fundraiser for a local school, so we were doing a good deed by purchasing bland Italian inspired food products that were presumably for consumption. The food wasn't good. Salads, pasta, pizza and breadsticks were all ordered, and none were anything better than passable. If you grew up eating this stuff, I can see why you might like it, but not me.The service wasn't great either: the waitress (who was not at all busy) was inattentive and made mistakes, but she apologized for them and was very friendly when she did come by, so no big deal. I did greatly appreciate that they separated the bills on a single receipt and of course that the were willing to partner with the school. The decor is quite nice for a family pizza place, but again the food wasn't.1 star for the food, 1 for the charity, and 1 for them not complaining about what total asses we were being that night (I brought 'Would You Rather' cards, which created much merriment at our table but likely inspired only disgust and annoyance to the few other patrons and employees within earshot).",

Complaints about the service are well-founded, as we had a pick-up order and it took 3-4 minutes of standing at the counter for anybody to even wait on us.I ordered the thin crust pizza, and won't return to Monical's, so I address only the thin crust.  The pizza was pretty bland, despite a hefty helping of oregano.  There is very little sauce, fairly dry cheese, and a chewy crust.  Heed other reviewers' advice and get the dipping sauce, because you will need it.",

Nice simple, clean, fresh flavors, and when you bite into the crispness of the crust, you get a nice roasty, wheaty aroma.One oddity was that I think they put some of the toppings, like basil, on after the pizza is baked, which I haven't seen before. It does work out well, since some toppings do burn pretty easily, and it is kind of an interesting contrast having both fresh and baked flavors together, but I'm not sure I'm a convert.The staff has been pretty good; they seem happy.",

They always seem to be offering great deals as well.  The staff is always super attentive to make sure you are getting the best deal possible as well.  I went in once to order a large pizza to go, and the staff said that on this particular day, we could get an extra large pizza for the same price.  Score.  Another day we were able to score two large pizzas for the price of one.  It seems Vinny's holds really awesome deals like this on every day of the week (A different deal each day) so it's definitely worth checking out just because of some of the awesome deals they have on food.I will definitely be eating here again.  It may not be extremely good pizza, but its good pizza and definitely makes my stomach happy.",

I, personally, have had it with cracker-crusts (aka Monicals, Jupiters, etc) and knew that a 3yr old and 7month old baby would not tolerate a 60minute wait for Papa Del's.  Jet's was a possibility, but they don't have indoor seating and we'd be relegated to eating pizza in the van.   So this is what came up on Yelp.   This pizza place is smack in between Seaboat and Jarlings.  So I knew if the pizza was a complete disaster, we'd at least have a good ice cream dessert afterwards!   Vinny's has a small/medium sized dining area.   They have a HUGE menu -- tons of pizza options (make your own, hawaiian, gyro, cheeseburger, mexican, BBQ chicken, and any other combination you can think of).  They have calzones, salads, appetizers, wings, slices (they roll out new slices every two hours and each day they pick about 10 different varieties to make).  The prices are reasonable.... we ordered a large supreme pizza (pepperoni, mushroom, sausage, peppers, onions), along with a bottle of rootbeer and an apple juice -- came to $22.   The pizza came out within about 10 minutes.   My toddler son was happy.   For NY style, it definitely wouldn't fly in NYC.  Not a chance.  But here, in Champaign.... it's not bad.   There's no char on the bottom of the pizza.... the crust is thin, chewy, crunchy and foldable.  The bottom is covered in cornmeal if I'm not mistaken....  The toppings were ok -- generous.   But past that.... it was ok.   I still think the best NY style pizza is Manalo's over by Krannert.  Nothing to write home about, but at least it wasn't a cracker crust!  And yes, we went over to Jarling's for dessert!",

You can buy by the slice as well if you like boring pizzas (what they have on hand).  If this place was on campus they'd make a killing, but unfortunately it's a bit of out of the way on Kirby.  I highly recommend coming here for pizza if you live in Savoy or Champaign, its prices are also very reasonable.Their other dishes aren't bad, I had a couple of their sandwiches, but I don't think they stack up to the pizza.",

I marvel at how many pizza and sandwich places claim to be \"East Coast.\"  I was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY (thank heaven) and experienced Brooklyn pizza or East Coast pizza.  This isn't it.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't bad pizza and the calzones are quite good, but when a business makes claims to being \"East Coast,\" it sets the bar higher.  The crust on this was good and the toppings decent if taken simply as midwest pizza.  Hey, I'm not being snobbish about Brooklyn pizza.  Brooklyn can't make BBQ like Texas or Kansas City or make a Muffaletta like New Orleans or crab cakes like on the Chesapeake.  But they can make an awesome pizza.  The closest I came to New York pizza here in C-U was Antonios before it mysteriously closed down.  Vinny's is pretty good pizza, so give it a try, but don't for a moment think that this is East Coast pizza if the implication is New York style. Take it from The Godfather.",

The restaurant is kept clean, napkins stocked, etc. We usually have 6-8 people, and there's almost always ample seating for the entire group. Pizza by the slice is a great deal, as the slices are huuuge and delicious. The plain cheese slice is a basic done right, and I adore the chicken-bacon-ranch monstrosity available on Fridays. They now offer certain slices with the Sicilian-style crust, which is great if you like fluffy-crust pizza. I would rather have their NY-style - a perfect level of crispness. Mmmm. Vinny's also has sliders, sandwiches and salads, but these seem to take slightly longer than pizza by the slice.

Our party of four did the dine-in experience, which probably put us in a minority, as the place appeared to have a brisk carry-out business on this rainy Sunday night.  The house salad at $4.52 was chopped iceberg and lousy tomatoes (but in November all tomatoes are lousy).  Its not a place to get a salad unless the pizza-guilt is overwhelming.The we had two medium pizzas, each with two ingredients and just tap water to drink which totaled $29.  Later we had second thoughts and added a cheese only pizza, also a medium which was another $7.  It was more than enough food for four people, so we brought home at least a whole pizza and the total expenditure was $9/per person.The pizza was piping hot because we dined in.  Its not Brooklyn or New Jersey, but it was not the cardboard horror that is sold at Dominos, et al.We wanted to eat there so we were offered paper plates that were the cheapest thinnest paper plates that can be bought.  I'd spruce up the dine-in experience if I owned the joint, but the workers were all very friendly, the service was quick and the price was right.  If I was chained (with a long chain) to a tree in Hessel Park, I'd choose Vinny's over Monicals every time.  At least in Vinny's the owner/operator appeared to be an Italian and the salad wasn't buried under a pile of shredded American cheese in the manner of Monicals.The Vinny's pizza is cut into triangular wedges as a pizza should be, and lends itself to folding and eating sandwich style as would be done in NY/NJ.It appears the place is well situated for the high school lunch crowd as the menu suggests pizza by the slice during weekday lunchtime.",

Well if you want something other than those fast-pizza chain places this will suit you just fine....Is it the best pizza?  No, Papa Del's gets that award, especially for their amazing deep dish, but for a game-day pizza where you're gonna have a bunch of people and maybe some beer, Vinny's works pretty well.  It tastes good too, which is always a plus.",

You can get staples like cheese or sausage everyday but more exotic toppings are change daily.   Reasonable prices.  Looks like they did away with the $2.50 medium on Monday afternoons.  That was an absolute steal, and gives you an indication of the value Vinny's gives customers.Lots of choices on the menu, and everything my lady and I have tried has been good, some pretty great.   Pizza, sliders, and fresh salads (that come with garlic bread) are all unregrettable choices.Decent italian beef.  And around here, decent is pretty good IMO.  I'm accustomed to Johnnie's in the Chicago suburbs, and that's the best beef I've had anywhere.  Vinny's isn't in the same league, but it's pretty good in comparison to local competitors.Bottom line, Vinny's is a very good (more than) pizza joint to begin with, but the icing on the cake is that the owner and staff are just nice people.  I'd certainly rather put my money in their pocket than any other pizza place in town, where the pie isn't nearly as good or fresh anyway (I'm looking at you, Za's!)",

We have also experimented with their Greek salad, Philly cheesesteak, calzones, mozzarella sticks, & garlic knots. All of which were so good! I highly recommend you check this place out. Yum! Also, I feel like I have to address the bad reviews... I've never felt discriminated against when I've eaten in and the pizza is sometimes so fresh that it's too hot to eat even when delivered in the middle of this negative degree weather! These people should really give Vinny's another shot!",

Please do not call a pizza \"east coast\" or \"NY\" style just because it's thin.Having grown up and spent most of my life in NJ/NY area, I've had my fair share of good pizzas. This place does not even remotely compare to anything in NY.The crust was not cooked at all. The sauce had no taste. The cheese was burnt, and it was not fresh mozzarella. You could taste the chlorine from the water in the dough.There are plenty of decent NY pizza places in the Chicago area (e.g. Cafe Luigi). Sadly, there is nothing even resembling good quality pizza in the Champaign/Urbana area, this is including Papa Del's or Antonio's. I'd save my money and eat at home.",

If you want a real meal, then Deep Dish is what you want.  And if you can't get to Chicago to have some Lou Malnatti's and are in Champaign / Urbana then you have to go to Papa Del's.Just beware, this delectably deep dish pie takes 55 minutes to bake.  If you are hungry and need the quick hit of Chicago's best food then call ahead.  But if you are like me and can let a great meal take its due course, you can order a pitcher of your favorite brew and enjoy that while taking it easy and conversating with your friends.  After all, Deep Dish Pizza is all about sharing, because no man, and I mean no man can tackle a Large Deep Dish Sausage by himself.The only reason why this place gets a 4 instead of a 5 is because their Shiner Bock was flat, the service was not so great, and they are not in Chicago.  If these things were remedied, they would easily be a 5 star, but sadly rural Illinois is not Chicago....",

Go get a pizza at Pizza Hut express and leave one more table open at Papa's...The secret is, call ahead.  It does take 45 to 55 minutes for them to cook a pizza, that's how good (and thick) they are.  This place is, hands down, my favorite pizza ever... however if you are especially anal about service, just get it delivered.

Unfortunately, the dough didn't do it. It was the same dough that was used for the breadsticks but it felt like I was eating pizza on a giant piece of Wonder Bread!

Granted, the restaurant was pretty full, and they seemed understaffed so I just asked for a table. He told me to \"sit tight\", which I did. I sat tight for at least 15 minutes without anyone paying any more attention to me. An update on time would have been really nice. Even just saying a word to remind me that I hadn't become invisible would have been appreciated. Of course they were too busy running past me to say anything though. After wasting 20 minutes of my lunch break, I gave up and left.Hopefully I can come back and actually try the food. But, the service here is really poor from what I can tell.

The campus location offers dine-in, delivery, or carry out. Be warned that the dine-in option is limited by space. All the tables are essentially crammed into a corner, which not only makes for a sometimes spatially uncomfortable seating arrangement, but also for a very unamusing game of who can shout the loudest to overcome the raucous echoes from other tables. Whether you dine in or out of the restaurant, expect a longer wait that usual. This isn't the usual pizza, so naturally it requires more than the usual time to prepare. Regardless, Papa Del's is worth experiencing - don't leave Champaign without doing so!",

This significantly cuts down on your waiting time at the restaurant. Take out is the fastest option. My pizza has always been ready within 45 minutes of placing my order.The deep dish \"pan\" pizza is their specialty. The toppings are always fresh and delicious. I order garlic on every pizza I get from Papa Del's because it is just so fresh and delicious. I'm not a big sausage fan, but I enjoy theirs very much.

There are signs posted all over the place admonishing customers for this, that, and the other.  They will actually tow their customers cars if they park in one of the spots closest to the back entrance which they reserve for their delivery drivers (aside: isn't it customary to have your employees park at the far end of the lot to reserve the good spots for your customers?)  The first time I went in to pick up a pizza, I was a bit taken aback bu the \"get the f out\" vibe.  Since then, I've heard a lot of horror stories from employees and customers about the way the owner treats people.  My favorite involved kicking out a family with an infant for bringing in outside food to feed the baby.  The kid had a bag of freakin' Cheerios.  I heard this from an assistant manager who ended up quitting because they just couldn't deal with having to treat people that way anymore.I've given up the tasty pizza on the premise that I'm really doing the owner a favor.  He clearly hates his customers, so now I'm one less thorn in his side.",

For me, the taste is about the same.Part of this could be my status as a \"thin-crust guy\" but even after trying their thin crust, I wasn't impressed. Besides the sauce being of the persuasion that induces heart burn 90% of the time for me, the crust wasn't like a cracker, but more like cardboard. I won't comment too much on the deep dish, but I will say that the sausages were nice and crispy which is something I'd like to see more on pizza in general. The crust, which should be the best part of deep dish was kind of chewy......for me. I'm not the definitive pizza reviewer.I would give this place three stars; however, minus one star for service, which was really bad. We had a large group and one of the servers in particular was rather abrasive when we asked to have a large table. Our main server didn't do a good job either of keeping drinks filled, which normally is not a pet peeve for me, but when I've gone an hour sans fill up, I tend to get cranky.",

We were so hungry that we said forget it, we'll eat this one. Then we tried to cut into it. The bottom was rock hard, and burnt to a crisp. The knives could not cut through it. And in the center of the pizza, you ask? Yep--cold as ice. WTF?!We called the waitress over, told her we'd pay for the drinks, but wanted to send the pizza back. 2 minutes later the owner is at our table, screaming at us that we are paying for the g-- d--- pizza. After attempting to calmly explain the situation, he said he didn't give a shit about that, he was getting his money. So I said, \"ok, sure, no problem. You go get the check.\" And we left while he went to get the check.Then-- oh yes, there's more-- about 2 weeks later there is a knock at the door of my mom's house, although I no longer lived there. She phoned me and said, \"Um... the police are here about a pizza you didn't pay for?\" What a dick! (The waitress had known me in high school and knew my name). I told my mom not to pay, and that I'd deal with it, but of course she was just worried about me and paid it.

Though it is thick and cooked in a pan, I don't really consider this to be a Chicago deep dish pie, but I consider Del's pan pizza to be a style of its own. Though the pan pizza is good, I feel it is overrated by most patrons as it has a disproportionately high ratio of dough to toppings.My preference therefore is Del's thin, which I think is the unsung hero of the Papa Del's menu. Their thin pizza has a crust roughly 1/4 inch thick, which comes out from the oven crispy on the bottom and softened by the ingredients on top. To me, the thin pizza's proportion of dough to sauce, cheese, and other toppings is just about perfect.Normal cooking time for a thin is 30 minutes and for a thick (pan) is 45 minutes. Adjust  these numbers upward if you are dining at a busy time, particularly on Illini home football game weekends.Del's serves excellent garlic bread which will tide you over between the time you sit down and the time your pizza is served. Service and the overall dining experience at Papa Del's can be spotty at times. The main dining room is a building whose tall ceilings and walls turns it into a bit of an echo chamber; the space would be improved by wall treatment that would deaden the sound. Groups of patrons are sometimes doubled up at the long tables with other groups of patrons, even when there's plenty of vacant dining space available, and the college-aged wait staff can be hard to flag down at times, though at other times they are attentive and responsive.For those reasons I order for pick-up (Papa Del's also offers delivery) more often than not. In any event, my fondness for Papa Del's is not about the service and dining experience; it's all about the pizza.",

The cheese and crust were dry, yet the top was drowning in half dry marinara sauce.This place is empty save weekend nights, and it is easy to tell why.",

It's delicious. But, we could have been in Chicago for the time it took to get. And then, at least, we would have been in Chicago.

I agree with the dude from Peoria, AZ, if you want fast service, do go to pizza hut. What separates Del's pizza to Hut's pizza is the attention to detail the pizza you eat at Del's gets. There is a process t making their pizza. True can be said of Pizza Hut's, but Del's is deliberate and the end product is a pizza you can be proud to eat. I have eaten here 3 times and I loved it every time. Not only is the pizza delish, the place is immaculate. Walking in the restaurant, you are transported out of Central Illinois and to a different region of the world. There is a great contrast and this adds to the experience. There is a fountain, the tiles look like its from Italy, the two storied dining area gives the place a cool feel to it.The pricing is just right. True, to a person used to eating at Antonio's, Pizza Hut, or Sbarro, the pricing may seem high, but consider the quality of food compared to Papa Del's- not even close. So, it is well worth the extra few dollars to eat here. Plus the pizza is so damn filling. So, when you think about it, you are paying for your food for the day and possibly tomorrow.The only reason why I am giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because although they do accept credit cards in the store; they do not accept then for ordering out. I called there and I got less than desirable service. I wanted pizza to order out one day because I was too lazy to leave my apartment, but whatever, I wound up just walking back to the restaurant and ordering my food there. They should accept credit cards over the phone. But, that's about all I have to complain about. To summarize,Best- Great food, excellent service, unique looking place, big portions, reasonable priceWorst- Don't accept credit Cards over the phone",

Since every single person in Illinois seems to be some sort of self-crowned pizza expert, I'll tell you upfront: I'm not. I'm just a regular person who eats food. Sometimes I eat that food in Chicago. Most times I eat it in Portland. But in my 28 years of eating food, I've never eaten pizza that I like better than Papa Del's. The last time I was visiting, I even stuffed a frozen pizza into my checked luggage to take back to Portland, where I threw it in the oven a mere 90 minutes after my plane landed. What I mean to say is: this is special, special pizza.I'm seeing a lot of complaints about service, but that's missing the point. Does one complain about climbing a mountain to obtain wisdom from the guru at the top? (Actually, I probably would.) Yes, the service is miserable, but that's just part of the journey! There are two seating options to choose from while you wait (and wait, and wait): a sterile, cavernous dining room, or the small bar area, where the jukebox will inevitably be blaring an entire Journey album. Oh, neither of those suits you? Sheesh, why not ask Jesus to tidy up his manger while you're at it? The service has never improved at all during the 10 years I've been eating here, so it's futile to even spend time wishing it would; it's just what you have to deal with if you want the pizza.There is this part of the crust where the cheese sort of gets stuffed inside, and it's all gooey and amazing and occasionally I think about it when I'm supposed to be thinking of something else. I start eating each piece with a fork, but about 2/3 of the way up, I always just give in and eat it with my hands so I can best enjoy those precious bites that meld with the crust. The breadsticks are like giant loaves of bread, and you can get them with the pizza sauce or with this nacho cheese that I would normally reject outright, but for some reason it's amazing here. And really, I can only eat two slices, but sometimes I dare myself to go for three, and damn it if it isn't worth the stomach ache every time. What was it I said before? Oh, yes: this is special, special pizza.",

After waiting to be seated we ordered our pizzas because the waitress advised that they take a while. About a half-hour later she brings the first of the two we ordered. She then tells us I have some bad news that may be good news. She tells us she gave our second pizza to the wrong table however if we still want it the other table only ate a couple of pieces and we can have it for 50% off!I thought she was kidding but she was completely serious. I told her that was pretty gross and that we wanted a fresh pizza. She puts the order in and 45 minutes later the pizza still wasn't at our table although most of the people eating had left. Finally it came 50 minutes after she reordered. I asked to speak to the manager. The waitress came back and said the manager was busy and would only come out if we really wanted to talk to him but he would give us a discount.I told her I wanted to talk to him. A few minutes later a kid comes out of the kitchen wearing gloves and holding a spatula. I told him what happened and how long we waited and he said sorry. That was it. I told him about our waitress offering a partially eaten pizza and he said he talked to her about that. I am pretty sure she got someone from the kitchen to come out and not the manager. Long story short they took $5 off after we spent 2 hours in the restaurant. I will never go backObservations:The restaurant is dirty and needs a good cleaning The whole restaurant is dated and the finishes are worn out. The wait staff is clueless, obviously because nobody manages them.The only reason the restaurant is still going is because there is no real competition.Trust me go somewhere else where they want your business and maybe they clean once in a while..",

However, I never got the chance because the service was so AWFUL!My wife and I arrived on a Saturday night at around 8pm, so, granted, it was a little busy.  We told the hostess that we were looking for a table for two and, after lazily glancing around at about three tables, she told us there was nothing available and then just walked away! huh? Thankfully, a waiter came over shortly after and found us an open table in about 10 seconds.  If only securing a table guaranteed actually being served food.We were seated at a table pushed up against a wall and behind another family (I won't dwell on the fact that the decor is atrocious and reminiscent of a high school cafeteria - with decibel levels to match).  Well, perhaps because we were hidden behind another family or perhaps because of the staff's general inattentiveness, we were never waited on...nobody even came by to take a drink order.  I understand from the reviews that the wait here can be long, so I was willing to give them some slack.  However, waiting 20-25 minutes simply for someone to acknowledge your existence is absurd.  We really had enough when we started seeing people who had come in after us get waited on as soon as they sat down.  At that point we simply got up and left.  Perhaps the pizza here is really good.  I can't say for sure.  But if I decide to try it again, it will definitely be for take out.",

The others came out as expected, but as their pizzas came to the table our waitress realized she had forgotten to put in the order for a deep dish pizza my friend and I were splitting.  This is a pretty big mistake to make considering it takes a good 45 minutes to an hour to make a deep dish.  What's worse is what happened after that. Instead of offering to bring us an appetizer on the house or something to hold us over (I was pretty starving at this point and we had already been there for an hour) she simply says \"I would understand if you don't tip me, I'm sorry\"  and offered to make us a thin crust instead. I don't care for thin crust pizza so I declined and said we would just wait.  About fifteen minutes later she comes by and offers some garlic bread so we accepted that. However, she waited so long to offer it that we got it just before our pizza came out and we no longer wanted it. Basically it was just a really frustrating experience and the waitress could have been more helpful considering it was her big mistake.  I also didn't realize that it costs $4 for a Diet Coke. I mean, it's a large cup, but c'mon. That's pretty steep even with getting a refill. On top of that, when we got our pizza, I was not impressed. For the time I spent here, I could have just driven to Chicago and had a real deep dish pizza. It might be the best in Champaign, but I don't think it's worth waiting for.",

What I LOVED was I we could order the deep dish pizza (which takes 45 minutes for a whole pie) by the slice. Two pieces of pepperoni coming right up!!! The pizza was, of course, fabulous and hit the spot. I saw on a couple other reviews negative comments about the staff being disorganized. Our waitress was on her game and handled multiple diners flawlessly! I told her it was out first time dining there and she made her recommendations with confidence. The rest of the staff seemed excellent as well.  I can see why this is a top pizza place in Champaign/Urbana",

If you are an upstate, chicago person you will probably turn your nose up to their deep dish saying \"it isn't authentic, real chicago deep dish\". But as far as I'm concerned, it is the best deep dish south of I-80.It isn't lou malnati's or giordano's but thats okay. Its delicious, high quality, awesome pizza. Famous for this sausage, but I still prefer their pepperoni. The deep dish will take ~40 mins to cook. So I always call ahead regardless of if I'm carrying out or eating in to make sure the pizza is ready when I get there. You haven't had the U of I experience until you've been to Papa Del's!",

Takes 45-55 minutes which is just a fact that has to be accepted.  They have great sausage that they cook before making the pizza which provides a great carmalised crispy texture and taste that adds another layer of experience.Had Papa Del's in college 20 years ago and went back with my daughter this week and it is the same.  Great to see it serving up the same great pie.Lunch time they sell pre-made pizza by the slice.  Pan pizza with one topping but gets you quick pizza without the wait.  But the stuffed pizza is not offered.If you like greesy pizza or are a thin pizza fan then Papa's isn't for you.  But don't rate it then.  Like rating an Sushi place down because you don't like raw fish.",

The pizza was perfect and the italian salad was too big to finish.  The sausage on the pizza we ordered were like mini meatballs - almost too big for one bite.Everyone who works there is obviously a college student but very nice and helpful.  The restaurant has a weird layout and was typical dirty bar/college with crumbs, straw wrappers, napkins on the floor...so get your food to go if this would bother you.",

Rude!).Ordering-in: A good experience because I can avoid the cramped seating and the impolite staff. Deep dish holds well as a reheat option the next day.

I was fairly pissed about that, not only did it stain my jeans, but I knew I ordered a greasy pizza.Deep dish pizza was pretty good, but there was soo much sauce and not enough cheese. I usually enjoy pizza, equally if not more on the second day of eating it, and this pizza was not very good on day two. Overall, I'm not sure if I would go back, but I'm glad that I tried it.

However, I am a minimalist when it comes to pizza, and so, I like as few things on it as possible. The very concept of deep dish pizza goes against this philosophy of mine, almost to the point where I wouldn't even consider it pizza at all.Regardless of that, I will gladly eat a medium sausage deep dish style pizza from Papa Del's any day. Yes, Papa Del's serves the only deep dish pizza I will eat anywhere. I think that's a good enough endorsement.Don't overlook their thin crust pizza, though. It's every bit as good as the deep dish in my opinion and it's a solid option for the lighter appetites.I can't really say the service itself is bad like all of the other reviewers are saying. However, you will probably wait at least 45 minutes if you are ordering a pizza of any kind, so be warned.",

It sure has gotten mediocre.Went here today for lunch and first off the restaurant needs an update (this building dates from the 1990s if memory serves when the original location on 6th St. closed). It's ratty looking with a huge stain on the ceiling where the wallpaper has peeled off. Fix it. How hard can that be?The dough for the pizza (we ordered slices) has always been on the bready side, but I used to like that since it was moist and flavorful. This was dry as dust, lacking in sauce and tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp forever. Blech.And seriously. It's not 1976 anymore. A salad can contain something other than iceberg lettuce. It's even available here in the midwest now, if the local grocery stores are any indication. Use it.My nephew ordered breadsticks that were just gross. Huge batons of bread (the pizza dough?) with a nuclear cheese or marinara sauce. They were completely unflavored. No cheese, garlic, butter or anything. Just batons of dry bread. Again, gross.Sad that an old institution has gone so far downhill.",

The pizza was great, superb!  It was the thickest pizza I have ever had and can understand why the wait is what it is.  I live in the north suburbs of Chicago, and my favorite pan pizzas are Silo and Lou Malnati's.  It is hard to choose which I like more, but this was a nice change from my standard.  A side salad and one piece was plenty.  They offer pizza by the slice but then you won't have any leftovers.  That's no fun!They have their own parking in the back so you don't have to feed the meter.",

The thick crust takes about 40 minutes to bake and if there's a line already, expect your order to take about an hour and quarter. So, it's nice to place the order ahead of time, grab some drinks at the bar, and then get seated with about 20 minutes left to wait for your pizza. Staff is super friendly.Now for the food... the other reviews don't lie. It's delicious. I like Chicago deep dish and this is some of the best I've ever had. The dough is fantastic and the cheese is melted perfectly. They have a great selection of toppings to build your own pie and it's not too pricy.",

My sweetie and I are driving back from DC and have made Urbana the last stop before the last slog to Saint Paul.  After 2 weeks of fish in Iceland (wonderful!), I was ready for some more 'Merican food.  The night before it was BBQ.  What's more American that pizza?  I remembered Papa D's and off we went.We got a medium, thin crust, with peperoni peppers, olives, and Italian sausage.  And (it IS a college town!) a pitcher of Sam Adams.  It was every bit as good as I remembered.  The left overs were a treat at breakfast.Next time in Urbana, it's a must-stop place.",

Although it may not seem possible to those whose conception of pizza centers on the east coast or California styles, Papa Del's thick crust is noticeably doughier, thicker, heavier, and more casserole-like than anything being served at a classic Chicago-style pizza place.  Our of respect for pizza aficionados, I have to note that there's a slight difference in kind, not degree, between what Giordano's serves and what Papa Del's serves.But second, it's still fantastic pizza.  It may seem pricey, but an 8-piece thick crust pizza can easily serve 4-6 because the slices are so filling and thick (it can feed 7 if you're like me and always have 6 sorority girls on diets hanging out with you).  The tomato sauce is delicious and perfectly-spiced and with the doughy crust it forms almost a focaccia taste (like a real focaccia taste and not what you get at Friday's).  The meat toppings are the best (bacon, pepperoni, and sausage are all great).  I would advise against getting onions, as they can overpower the rest of the pizza, but it's still very, very good thick-crust pizza and it's well worth the lengthy wait.It's not a 5-star because the dine-in service/experience is poor.  I strongly, strongly recommend getting take-out.  Also note the calender; if it's an Illinois home football or basketball game, call 60-90 minutes in advance and do not try to eat-in.  And the thin crust is lousy.",

I seriously have dreams about their deep dish with everything on it.  The crust is so tasty, the toppings are fresh and yummy.  I love the big sausage chunks and garlic, and the tomato chunks in the sauce...sure it might take a long time, but that's why you can call ahead and order a pizza and a table so you don't have to wait as long when you get there!  I read other complaints about slow waitstaff?...who cares?  Get a beer, bring a friend, relax and enjoy yourself!I am tempted to try their overnight shipping so I can get my Del's fix in Texas.  Maybe for my birthday...",

The waitress kept forgetting about us, it seemed, and the place was packed and not well-staffed enough for the amount of people here.Well, you guys know how I feel about customer service, so that would bring it down at least 1.5, if not 2, stars.The thing is, their pizza was awful!  There was too much dough and not enough cheese; the sauce was a bit under-spiced in my opinion, and the vegetables on my half of the pizza were sparse and didn't taste fresh.  I came in starving and didn't even eat a whole piece of pizza.I do remember, however, coming here years ago and really enjoying the thin crust pizza.  I saw some other people with it and it looked and smelled a lot better than mine, too, leading to my decision to give Papa Del's two stars instead of one.Also, the bathrooms were clean.That's about all I have to say.",

I've NEVER, EVER, EVER been to a pizza shoppe that DIDN'T have 'suggested' pizzas on their menu!  No \"Hawaiian\", \"Supreme\", or \"Carnivore Lovers\" pizzas here... if you don't bring your own inspiration, then you're SOL at Del's!  The waiter gave me a funny look when I mentioned this, as if he'd never noticed this before.  Strange...But back to the food...  This place makes pretty solid deep-dish pizza.  As with most deep-dish, it takes a while for it to come out, so plan your dinner time accordingly.  We ordered a large pizza, and each slice was practically a meal in itself.  It also reheated nicely the next day, which was a nice bonus.  The pizza WAS moderately expensive, but worth it.Note:  I wasn't as impressed with their cheese-bread appetizer as I was with their pizza.  I wouldn't recommend it.One other POSITIVE noteworthy addition:  I needed to break a $20 to get change for the parking meter.  The server didn't have the exact change on him, so he just smiled, gave me 4 quarters, and said \"Don't worry about it.\"  I don't see this kind of generosity very much.  It's only a buck, but it made my day.  Needless to say, he received a handsome tip from me!)",

Then the waitress brought waters to another table that sat down after us. Our water and beer were finally brought to our table and about a minute later so were our slices of pizza. The pizza was good, but not excellent... and lukewarm. It wasn't even hot. We both ordered sausage. The slices were pretty large, and the amount of sausage and cheese was plentiful. As we were finishing, she brought out our garlic bread. Our waitress never asked if we wanted refills or anything. I asked for the tab, it was $11.50, I put down a $20 and she came back took it and said \"Do you need change?\"..... I was a bit taken aback because of her lack of good, even mediocre service. I simply said yes I'll need change. All in all, it was just OK. Not sure if I'd go back, even if they weren't as busy. I've had much better pizzas, not to mention hot.",

I'll admit I'm a big fan of deep dish, and not everyone is...but I've also tried their regular crust pizza and it's also quite tasty. The seating is one of the drawbacks of this place though.  Sometimes this place gets so packed that you can't get a seat for another half hour from when you arrived, BUT at least you can put your pizza order in and save time, which is great.  It would be great if the place looked cleaner, but I don't really mind because the food is tasty.In my earlier post I said the waiters are pretty good.  I TAKE THAT BACK!They are terrible. There is actually one girl in particular that is just obnoxious. When I came with a group of friends we made sure to order half vegetarian pizza and half meaty pizza. Sounds easy enough. Well, the waitress ended up bringing us a full meaty pizza and when I told her that's not what we ordered she said \"I heard all meat\" and walked away. SERIOUSLY? When she came back to fill our drinks my other friend got really pissed and said you could have at least offered to fix the problem...she just rolled her eyes and walked away. Finally, she ended up bringing a personal thin crust for my bf, but it was ridiculous the attitude she gave us. Isn't the customer always right? I clearly stated what we wanted on our pizza, is that so hard to understand?Despite the terrible service, I'd say this is the best pizza place in Urbana-Champaign, and sometimes even when I'm in Chicago i cannot help but get a craving for Papa Dels deep dish.

I was warned it would be crowded, but I'm willing to walk into the fires of Mt. Doom for some good pizza.My experience: Meh.So, I think that people really love Papa Del's because that's where they went in college. It brings back fond memories of late nights or drinking or whatever. I get that. I am very nostalgic for certain college hangouts of my own. However. Papa Del's pizza SUCKED.I might be a bit unfair in my review. It might be amazing if you get a fresh pie made. It could be incredible. But the slices we got at 1:30 pm (after 20 minutes wait)? SUCKED.They were hardly warm, yet still had dark-brown spots from spending too long waiting to be served. Husband had a sandwich, which he said was decent, but everyone had talked up this pizza. Said it was better than Vinny's, better than Rosati's, etc. WHAT. It wasn't inedible, but I was far from impressed.Service wasn't outright rude, but also wasn't fantastic. I get it, it's lunch rush on a Saturday. You're used to getting treated poorly by college kids. Still, I expect a certain level of positive attitude from waitstaff. I certainly don't want to be treated like I'm a burden upon you because I chose to eat at your restaurant.In my opinion, if you aren't a current UIUC student, or someone going for nostalgia, there are better pizza places on campus.",

We had champagne to accompany our Chicago-style pizza, which is my new favorite eating-take-out-at-home thing - the champagne and pizza combination, not necessarily Chicago-style.It's like eating a pie o' pizza and, apparently, Papa Del's does it better than most joints in The Windy City. Stuffing is entirely customizable and we were treated to a sausage, pepperoni, bell peppers and onions smorgasbord. My mom-in-law also raves about a spinach something or other.PRO'S: Eat less to feel satiated, didn't seem as oily.CON'S: Gotta use utensils to eat hot (just had some cold for lunch, sans fork and knife).Sorry Papa, this is one time I'm picking a girl over a guy - I'll forever be enamored to my Hot Mama's.",

My boyfriend is from Chicago and although we now live in central Indiana, we still love a good Lou Manalti's pie when we get a chance.We had never been here before, and although it was about 7pm on a Saturday night, we were able to get a table without a wait. There was, however, quite a wait before a server came by to take our order; it was probably 15 minutes and then we finally just flagged someone down.Boeyond that, everything was great. We ordered a pan pizza and after an hour (which they tell you is the wait time for a pan pizza), it was brought out in all its glory. It was amazing. Just like a Manalti pizza exept it lacked the one thing I HATE about most Chicago style pizzas - the chunky sauce! The sauce was smooth but flavorful and full of spices. I cannot stand chunky pizza sauce so I was very excited. It was SO GOOD. The slices were so thick and loaded that I was full after just one. We ended up taking more than half the pie home.Our dining partners had the \"thin crust\", and I use quotes because it really was what I would consider to be hand tossed in thickness. It looked wonderful and I would like to try it next time.All in all, worth the wait. The building is set up oddly but they make it work. There is a full bar and the menu also includes pastas and sandwiches if you are not feeling a pizza.",

But it doesn't compete with Chicago-area Chicago style pizza so I must say I still was a little disappointing.I got a stuffed pizza with spinach.  I felt like there could have been a lot more spinach on it, and something about the crust just didn't seem right.  It was tasty and pretty soft, but the bottom was surprisingly hard and it seemed like the crust to pizza ratio was too high.  Also, we got a loaf of garlic bread for the wait.  It wasn't bad, but I've made better garlic bread at home.  Some parts of the loaf were just too dry and bland.  It was pretty cheap though, so no big deal.I guess overall, if you want a Chicago-style pizza, then go for it.  But try to hit up a pizza place in the Chicago area sometime!",

Although it's moved from their old location, it brought back lots of memories for my parents and we all very much enjoyed our lunch.Papa Del's was relatively empty at 2pm on a Monday afternoon, but I can imagine it gets crazy during the school year, particularly on a weekend night.  The prices were cheaper than I might have expected (based on visiting some deep dish places in downtown Chicago), and the beer was definitely well-priced.  I can see why it attracted students of UIUC way back in the day and continues to do so now.We ordered a medium deep dish with Pepperoni, Mushroom, and Extra Cheese.  It was the perfect pizza for 3 people, although I ate half the pizza by myself, and could have kept going had we not had dinner plans about 3 hours later.  We got the Blue Moon on draft, but they also had Sam Adams as well as a few other drafts. Service was efficient, professional, and courteous, and ambiance was what you'd expect from a college-town pizzeria.  No more, no less.Overall, it was great to enjoy lunch at Papa Del's not only for nostalgic reasons, but also for the quality of the pizza.  I'm certainly no deep-dish pizza expert, but this place really hit the spot for us!",

Many people overlook the thin crust, which I like, esp. when I don't want the volume of the pan.  The stuffed is too much for me.  Surprisingly, the sandwiches are a cut above what you would expect at a place like this - an afterthought.  A note:  Years ago they used to have a location on Wright. St. where they sold sandwiches and slices.  That was nice, and convenient.  Wish they could do something like that again.  Maybe take over the McDonald's spot in the Union food court.  Honestly  - how could McDonald's not be successful there?  It seemed busy whenever I was there.",

In Chicago, stuffed pizza usually has a lot of cheese with only a little bit of crust. This pizza was totally the opposite, with hardly any cheese and a crust as thick as a loaf of bread. The crust also had a bread texture with no flavor whatsoever. I noticed a number of tables around leaving nearly half of their crust before they moved onto the next slice. When you have to leave that much crust behind, something is wrong. Also, there was hardly any sauce on the pizza, and the sauce was burnt as well. Another thing they did was add A LOT of oregano on top. If it was a good pizza, it should be able to stand alone without any help. The addition of this oregano makes me wonder if the restaurant isn't confident in their pizza. While I kindly asked for the rest of my pizza to be put in a to-go bad, I threw it away in a garbage can near my car, as I knew I would never finish it at home.I also ordered garlic bread with cheese. The bread was hardly toasted, and the cheese peeled right off. Again, very disappointing.I was thinking that this would be a good alternative to Chicago-style stuffed pizza. But what I had tonight was anything like Chicago-style. Basically a loaf of bread with mediocre sausage and burnt sauce.",

I also tried the large meatballs and marinara sauce (which is something I picked up after living out east) and it was awesome.   The meatballs were super flavorful and the sauce had the perfect sweetness.  If you're in the Champaign area, Papa Del's should be a definite stop on your Campus tour.",

In short, it was for the experience. The food was actually pretty good. I'm from the Chicago area, and I think this place does a comparable job with Chicago style deep dish pizza, a few hours south of the real deal. So the story is, I was coming here with 16 people. If you were going with fewer, I think you'd be fine. I think. We called ahead. We were told we couldn't make a reservation unless we put in an order on the phone. We didn't do that, and when we got there the back dining room (not the front area because of a basketball game) was empty. The basketball game could be why the place was out of sorts with their service. Anyway, the staff at the front seemed to be aware of our phone call and, though seemingly difficult, they were able to put together some tables for us. The waiter was nice enough and took our drink orders and understood when we explained how many of us would be on separate checks (needing to get reimbursements) at the end of the meal.Since some people ordered the deep dish pizza that knowingly takes a long time to cook, we got cheesy garlic bread at my table to share, and it was so good. A pair in our group also ordered some and never got it. When they asked and the waiter said he would put it in, we were already nearly done with ours and pizza was coming shortly. They canceled that. For the entree, I got the lasagna because it was the Thursday special. It was a very generous portion that came with bread and salad. Though a good deal, the lasagna flavor wasn't anything to write home about, in fact, a bit too salty in my mind. The ricotta inside had nice herbs. Now, the pizza, is another story. I'll share a picture I took of the everything but the kitchen sink pizza a friend got. I was impressed. The issue was the timing. The four of us eating on my end of the table were nearly done before some in the middle and on the other end got their food.I know we were a large group, but the timing was very off. Several groups (a couple and a group of 3, I think) came in, ate, and left in the time we waited for our food. The waiter and kitchen seemed to need extra help. Another group of people we knew came in about a half hour after us and were told the place was out of deep dish. They only had one more lasagna. With 16 people, we cleared the Papa Del's kitchen. If you're going to try your luck with Papa Del's, I say get it for take out or go with a smaller group.",

Our total was very cheap too, because my bro acquired 20 coupons for a special deal.I'll be honest, I was a bit skeptical because this is Champaign.... a very far cry from Chicago. Once you are south of 80... be very wary of Pizza! now to the good stuff: the super Stuffed. It was fantastic! The crust looked sort of dry on the initial viewing, but on tastinhg, it was awesome. It has a nice chew, but was not chewy or crunchy. As for the cheese, the pizza had plenty, which was awesome as well. The sauce was very good too; it wasn't amazing, but it was seasoned nicely and did not just get dumped from a can (unless I'm totally !off, which I doubt). I actually wish there was more sauce, but oh well.I was pleasantly surprised at how good papa Del's was. IT made me feel like I was still eating Za from Chicago, which is a very good thing.Will I be back? You can count on it. The onlydecision I have to make: Their Deep Dish, or the SuperStuffed with Spinach (Only got cheese on this previous trip)? either way, I'm looking forward to it",

They are big and heavy and take a long time to cook.  Every time we have ordered one for work I have to wait when I arrive because it is still cooking.  Every time.  It's a messy kind of pizza too so maybe that's another reason I am not fond of it.  I would not recommend it nor would I discourage anyone from trying.  Seriously on the fence with this one.My advice is try it for yourself then decide what you think and Yelp about it.",

That I devoured completely on my own. Oh sweet free deliciousness.Everybody has their own opinions about the best pizza in Chambanavoy. Unfortunately, many of them are wrong. Papa Dels is the best. Half a medium cheese deep dish is enough to kick my fat butt. However, it does take forever and it is fairly spendy.Eating in is not always awesome. Being that it takes them 45+ minutes to cook a pizza, you'll see a lot of people sitting around waiting for their pizza (since some people are silly enough not to call in their order ahead of time). This means that it can sometimes be tricky to get seated - due to all the people waiting (AKA Papa Del's noobs). Service ranges from mediocre to OK.Bathrooms are clean and they have toilet paper that is a step or two above  the stadium grade/industrial sandpaper variety.Overall, I can't imagine Chambanavoy without Papa Del's. It is awesome. I wish it were cheaper and faster, but I also wish that I had Super Man's abilities. Can't have everything you want in life, you know? I guess I'm just going to have to drown my sorrows in another delicious Papa Del's pizza. Nom nom nom.",

There are two things to tell you.If you haven't eaten here and are reading this review, then you are probably from out of town.  The one thing I can say that might influence your decision is this: the stuffed pizza here is better than any I can find in Chicago.  Honestly, I have tried everything and keep looking.  Stuffed pizza, foodie pizza, local pizza - none better.  That should be all I need to say.But once you get there the other thing you need to know is this: the service is epic slow.  Remember when you studied The Odyssey in school and the teacher told you about the oral tradition and it not being written down for a few centuries?  That is how they train the waitstaff here.  For decades the means of serving people in a lovingly slow and sometimes forgetful fashion have been passed down to new staff with such fidelity that I can only call the institutional memory involved Homeric.  Embrace it as part of the experience and realize that the name tags are hand written, the one old thing about the staff is that almost everyone seems new.  The pizza will eventually be delivered, be patient, it will be worth the wait.",

                "review": "Papa D's, as I like to call it, is the most awesomest (deep-dish) pizza in Champaign, if you order 90 minutes before you're hungry. Papa Del's is an institution in Champaign-Urbana. I've read reviews that say it's not as good as Chicago's own Chicago-style. To that I say Bull-hocky! You're just hating on Champaign because you're here for school and you miss you're hometown! I've had Papa D's deep dish and Gino's East in Chi-town. Side-by-side I don't think I could tell the difference. I've never ordered a thin crust or a sandwich at Papa D's so I can only speak to their most beloved menu item, the Super-Stuffed pizza. (The pizza President Clinton ordered when Air Force One landed in Champaign). I have nothing to say other than it's awesome. It's great. It's the bee's knees. It's the spider's web. (does that last one make sense?). Seriously though, if you like stuffed pizza, get a Papa Del's sausage (or pepperoni) and spinach (unless you hate spinach). Two big draw backs to Papa D's: It's on campus. So us townies can wait to sample it's offers three times a year (spring break, summer break, and winter break), or, or!, order from the NEW, NEW! location at Village at the Crossing (you're welcome Papa D, call (217) 359-5500). I've never ordered from that location, but I've eaten that location's pizza and it's just as awesome as the Green street location, minus the students and traffic.The other big drawback is the delicious deep-dish takes a while to create and bake, so you have to be patient or order ahead of time. If you dine-in at the Green Street location you can plan on waiting 90 minutes if you're in a large group. Alone or in a smaller group the usual wait time is closer to 45 minutes. If you order-out or arrive when the students are gone you can expect to wait less. BOTTOM LINE:Great food + long wait time - fair price - \"I can't believe you haven't tried this already\" = worth it. If you live in Champaign more than a year and you like pizza, I won't respect you if you haven't at least tired Papa D's (stuffed pizza).",

If you don't want the Big Three toppings - pepperoni, cheese, sausage - you could have a plain crust, I guess, but there's no chicken, pineapple, Canadian bacon, steak, jalapeos or anything else even a millimeter away from conventional.   That said, the pizza was pretty good, if unoriginal.   The atmosphere of the place was lively.    Being able to pre-order is a stroke of genius - you put your name in for a table and your pizza order.   By the time you have a table, the food is on its way.   This place is a U of I tradition.   Far be it from me to diss Papa Del's.    However, like the Illini football team, Papa Dels could stand a little work improving their game.",

When I visit home, my parents say, \"what do you want us to cook?\"  To which I respond, \"Huh?  We're getting papa del's, aren't we?\"  The chicago style is awesome.  But the thin-crust is overlooked IMO.  It's what I grew up eating.  And is still my first choice.  The crazy good sausage, the oozing gobs of cheese.  Oh my, thank goodness we're going up for the Michigan game this weekend.  I need a fix.  And yeah, we were up 2 weeks ago.  And had Papa Del's.  Your point would be?!?  Word of warning--on a Saturday night, while school is in session, easily a 1 1/2 hour wait for the pizza (even in the new West location).  Is it worth it?  Are you kidding me?  I'd wait days for this pizza.",

To be honest with you, I prefer thinner pizza, but my roommates insisted on trying Papa Del's one boring Sunday evening. We ordered a cheese and sausage which was delivered in about an hour.The dough is the correct consistency and there was not too much nor too little of it, which is usually an issue at many not-as-well-known deep-dish pizzerias. The cheese tasted great, and there was not 16 tons of it piled on, which can sometimes ruin the pie. Also of good quantity (and quality) was the sauce. It was flavorful and the pizza was not swimming in it, which is all too frequent a problem in the world of crappy deep-dish.The sausage itself was pretty tasty. I'm not sure if it was fresh or not, we probably should have asked. Back home, fresh toppings are deciding factors for my family, since we can be pizza Nazis. Either way, I just wish there was more of it on the pizza. There was probably only 1-2 little balls per slice, which in my opinion could have been more plentiful.I will definitely order Papa Del's again and recommend it to anyone who enjoys deep dish.",

Everybody seems to love Papa Del's, and for good reason.  Champaign is not exactly a hotbed of amazing cuisine, but Papa Del's delivers consistently delicious, hot, cheesy deep-dish awesomeness.  There's usually a line, but even on Friday night of homecoming weekend we only waited 30 minutes!  And they had us pre-order our pizza when we put our name in for a table, so by the time we sat down, we only waited about 15 minutes before the pizza arrived.  The beer is dirt cheap (the one thing that makes me want to consider living in a small town), and the pizza really hits the spot.  I'm not a pizza snob by any means - all I know is when I cut that first slice, and the cheese stretches out in delicious strands, and the crust is crispy....I'm a happy girl.  See you next homecoming!",

I mean, we're talking about crawling into a mounds of cheese, here, piled inside a fluffy, yet crunchy, yet bready, but firm crust, cradling us in a sauce that cannot (and I've tried!  Numerous times!) be replicated, with toppings that are big enough to knock down a running dog!  Who... in their right mind... could say no?And why would you??!  It's amazing!  It defies words!  It's a $27 pizza and worth every penny!But, as much as the pizza is a healthy 20 out of 5 stars (no joke!), there are some wicked negatives that come along with Papa Del's Pizza.  They are definitely unflinching when it comes to \"their rules\".  And they'll tell ya about it, too!  But, most of them that I've been privy to over the years have definitely fallen by the wayside in order to keep competitive with rival pizzerias.  For example, for the longest time they swore up and down that they would never deliver.  Any request for delivery was met with a rather harsh admonishment abt their restaurant being farrrrrr tooooo bussssy.  Don't get me wrong, they are that!  And it shows, too.  Their brick and mortar on Green is ALWAYS packed!  It's far too congested, and far too loud of an environment for me to consider an enjoyable experience.  We just grab our pizza and head back home!  I digress (take-out is wonderful, usually).  But, since, they've changed their stance on delivery. Franchising was another example.  That one still stands, though, some people consider the newer location (At The Crossing) to be one.  It's more of an extension of the actual restaurant for those who live on the southside of town.  That location has no in-restaurant dining, so be sure to come ready with plans to head somewhere else!There was a time they guaranteed they'd never ship their product, too, but that's also changed!  And for the better!  Pack a bunch of pies into a to-go carton, a few bags of dry ice, and it's pizza time from your freezer to your stove!  Brilliant!  If you're local, grab a few frozen pies while you're out getting your to-go order, and you'll have pizza for that 2AM craving! :DParking can be an issue at both joints.  While The Crossing is new (and there's ample parking available), it might not be right next to the door ('specially with all the new food places out there)!  The Green St location suffers from a different problem!  It's like the parking you'd find at a county fair!  Potholes about hip deep filled with rain water, usually. =P  Just be careful and watch where you're going.  People have been known to lose their car in some of those puppies.  It's all pan-sexual baby goats, and children with their wardrobes down there!",

Last night I actually had allotted 2 hours and we were completely done in a little over an hour and had surprisingly good service.

Oh wait, that's because Old Chicago has NOTHING to do with the city of Chicago itself.  It's based in Boulder, Colorado.  This would explain why the \"Chicago-Style Pizza\" was...not Chicago-style.  Yes, it's pizza baked in a pan, with a thickish crust, but when the sauce is not on top, it's not Chicago-style.  GET IT RIGHT OR PAY THE PRICE (to quote a favorite childhood TV show).Moving on.  I perused the website before we went, and was excited to see that on Thursday nights, they have $2.50 pina coladas and strawberry daiquiris.  I mean, $2.50??  Hell yeah!  See below:http://oldchicago.com/champaign/specialsWhen I mentioned these specials to the waitress, she looked dumbstruck.  After checking with her manager, she came back and said all they had were margaritas.  I sighed and said, sure, I'd have a margarita.  When she brought it, she informed me that she'd only charge me $2.50 for that one, but nothing else, because they didn't do specials anymore.  I responded that that was fine, but maybe they should TAKE THE SPECIALS OFF THEIR WEBSITE?  I mean, just a thought.  Oh wellz, the margarita was gross anyway.The one redeeming thing about Old Chicago is that it has a ridiculous beer selection.  Like, in the triple digits.  I have to respect that.  Otherwise, this place is pretty mediocre.",

When someone wants the chicken Alfredo without the chicken and wants veggies instead, you don't charge extra for the veggies. It's called \"special instructions\" on the POS. Granted it only cost $0.99 for the   substitution, but it's the principal of the cost of chicken vs the cost of veggies. Also, the veggies they gave were shredded carrots and broccoli with one sliver (literally one) of red pepper. There are better ways of going about substitutions.",

In this trip I tried 4 different items.Chicago 7 pizza: Good thing about this pizza is that it was loaded with toppings (Green peppers, Italian sausage, red onions,  Pepperoni, mushrooms, etc.) -- but the sauce was a bit too sour and it could have used additional cheese. The crust itself was tasteless and too hard to chew -- not really what you'd find in any of the great Chicago pizza restaurants.Classic wings -- Light and crispy but really lacking in flavor and meat juciness. The dish itself is too dependent on the sauce to have any flavor.Molten chocolate cake -- Not really a lava cake but the fudge was nice and rich and went well with the ice cream.The big cookie -- Wasn't great, wasn't bad -- the oatmeal chocolate chip cookie dough was a bit on the dry side and ice cream is almost mandatory otherwise the dish is too plain.Overall, the prices aren't bad and the portion sizes are good but the execution of the food could be improved.",

The pizza was fairly good, not too saucy, yet still flavorful, especially for sitting out on a buffet under heat lamps.  The buffet selection is very small, but they change it out frequently (every time I went up, there was a different selection).  I don't know if it matches \"Chicago style\" pizza, and frankly I don't care.  I'm not here for a particular style of pizza, I'm here for good pizza.The kid's root beer tour is a very nifty idea.  Kids get to order different root beers (nowhere did I see a menu, but the one our server recommended was pretty good), and once they've ordered enough, they get a T-shirt.Speaking of our server, he was fantastic.  Our drinks never ran out, he worked well with our kids, and he was very friendly without being bothersome.",

Overall, the food is pretty good and the atmosphere is nice when it isn't completely crowded.  It is a chain restaurant, so don't expect unique gourmet cooking.  The 'Chicago-style' pizza is more like a standard thick crust pizza as opposed to REAL Chicago-style pizza.  Try Papa Del's or Amano's if you're looking for more legit Chicago-style pizza.All that aside, Old Chicago is a nice place to go with friends and/or family.  I have usually had good service, and there is a full bar if you want a drink or two.  The prices are a little steep if you don't go on Tuesdays though.  PROS: Cheap on Tuesdays, decent food, pretty good service, family-friendly atmosphereCONS: Pricey on most days, NOT real Chicago-style pizza, loud when restaurant is crowded",

The service is good, and our waitress was so kind that although she said she can't use the yelp offer on all checks (because they were split checks), she did so. The food is so so for me. First we had the trio sampler appetizer, the cicilian pepperoni roll is quite good, and the itallian nachos taste more like crab rangoon minus the crab stick, but that two was the best one for me. The pizza, taste okay, but I didn't eat the deep dish one, so I couldn't judge on the pizza. Lastly we got the captain's catch which was also taste so so, really didn't leave much impression on me",

The service, it just sucked no other way to put it, get the really big beer because a refill may not be in your future. This place is not cheap 3 beers cost as much as the pie.

                "review": "Restaurant review:AYCE Chicago style pizza in Champaign, I couldn't pass up the chance to eat the pizza lunch buffet during the weekday. I quickly hopped into my car and jetted to this location for my lunch hour. I was surprised to find that there was plenty of seating in the restaurant. Staff was super friendly and I was off to the races to eat pizza. Now the \"Rush Street\" pizza bar is 8.49 Monday to Friday 11AM to 1:30 PM. They give you a choice of salad or the two soups (tomato bliss or chicken green chili soup). I was took the tomato bliss, very rich tomato soup. I wish they had some cheese to go with it. I proceeded to gorge on the pizza selection and the calzone. My impression is that they don't have any deep dish pizzas which is unfortunate when you think chicago style pizza the deep dish is the cornerstone. Lots of other pizza selection from meat lover to veggies to hawaian. The calzones were prepared well. The pizza is super hot so let it cool down just a little bit before diving in. Overall the pizza is comparable to other restaurant quality pizza and a bit better than the chains (papa johns and pizza hut). They are not kidding when they tell you that this is for the rush hour lunch crowd. Before I finished my soup, the check was on the table in case I had to pay and run. Service was friendly. Also and FYI you can request pizza for the buffet. So all and all the pizza is relatively good quality, but missing a deep dish would have pushed it over the top. Finally the chocolate chip cookie is a bit too small and just a odd way to end the meal. You get just a small one...Pro: AYCE lunch pizza buffet, better than papa john or pizza hut, super fast serviceCons: No deep dish pizza, if it is not busy you may have a very limited selection. There was 4 pizza types and the calzones and breadsticksHidden gem:AYCE Lunch pizza buffet. For the pizza lovers",

                "review": "While browsing for a place to find dessert in C/U, I noticed that Old Chicago had 3.5 stars.   I blurted out, \"3.5 stars?  Who is writing these reviews?\"  Seriously, that guy above me, or that girl below, who gave this place 4 stars.  They don't know what good food is.  Don't listen to them.  Sorry, but it's true.This place is a blaspheme of Chicago as a restaurant city.  The owners should write an apology and make cash reparations to the city for besmirching its reputation and as a consolation for anyone coming into this place thinking they would be getting true Chicago food.First off, you walk in, and the obligatory Chicago street sign, for Rush Street no less, is in orange.  Orange?  I grew up in Chicago.  Not once did I ever see an orange street sign.  Black on yellow or white on green.  We have orange highway hazard cones.  Hmmm, strike one.  Onto the menu.  The restaurant was started by a bunch of guys from Boulder Colorado who had never even been to Chicago.  Well, that sounds like the kind of people you want dishing up authentic Chicago food, doesn't it? The pizza combos used ingredients that no authentic Chicago pizzeria would ever be caught dead using.  Pineapple?  Chicken?  Anaheim chilis?  Oh, and then there's the lame \"Chicago Seven\" name to try and tie it all into Chicago.  Otherwise, the pizza names resemble something  you'd find at California Pizza Kitchen.  And I don't mean California Avenue, where Giordano's, a REAL Chicago pizza place, was founded.   Strike two.The pizza got to the table fast.  I do mean fast.  When pizza gets to your table in 15 minutes or less, that means one of two things:  wood burning oven, or frozen pizza warmed up in a conventional oven.  I'll leave the reader to guess which choice is correct.  Taste test time.  I've lived on the north side and the south side.  I know what the different neighborhood pizzas taste like, and what a Chicago pizza should taste like in general.This wasn't Chicago pizza.  The crust was cardboard-like.  Chicago isn't world-renown for its thin crust pizza.  But those neighborhoods pizza places that focus on thin crust do it in a cracker-style.  Not cardboard.   The mushrooms looked canned.  The tomato sauce was bleh.  Strike three.Oh, and just for good measure, the spinach artichoke chip seemed to be devoid of spinach, but not of salt.They do have a good beer selection.  I assume this is so you are tempted into drinking enough beer so that you do not notice how bad the pizza is.Avoid.  Steer clear.  There is a Rosati's in C/U as of the time of this writing, and that is representative of a Chicago-style pizza.  Ironically enough, Rosati's is based in Chicago, not Boulder Colorado.  Old Chicago would be a good place to bring a group, if you wanted to drink, watch a game on one of the 2,382 TVs they have, and don't care about the quality of the food you are about to eat.POST-SCRIPT:  about three days after getting this review, I got an email from the marketing department of the corporate parent of Old Chicago.  Basically saying that they are sorry we were dissatisifed with the experience and offering a voucher for free food.  This is the saddest part of the experience.  It was obviously just a form letter.  The folks didn't even bother to read the review to see why I was dissatisfied.  Strike 4 if that is even possible.  A restaurant that is non-responsive to their customer's concerns is the worst kind of restaurant.",

Their new \"Tavern style\" pizza is basically a less-good version of their NY-style pizza (which they no longer sell).  Both mine and my friend's pizzas were really salty.  Wasn't impressed.One of my biggest food-service pet peeves is staff who don't know what they're talking about.  I understand that just because you work somewhere doesn't mean you have all the answers--but if you don't know something, you shouldn't just LIE to the customer.  I asked our waitress if the Specialty pizzas were included in the half-off deal for Tuesday nights.  She said yes.  We got our bill--which she checked before giving to us--and I paid.  Of course, after we left I realized that our bill was about $5 too high.  Because the 50% hadn't been taken off my pizza.  Because specialty pizzas aren't included in the half off deal.  Won't be back to Old Chicago--not a fan of how they've changed their pizza, and the mistake on the bill was enough to keep me from returning.",

                "review": "I was pleasantly surprised, though my expectations were low. They were lowered further by the atmosphere/decor. This chain restaurant is indeed offensive on many levels to a person from Chicago: typical corporate chain restaurant wall flair is everywhere, and that schlock is indeed Chicago themed. There is a scoreboard that looks like Wrigley's, a sign for Rush Street, and everywhere you look are old timey pics of landmarks etc. etc. This in and of itself would not be so bad, but the fact that the chain so buttfucks the idea of Chicago deep dish pizza is irredeemable. The thing that they call deep dish likely has most of the ingredient groups of a Chicago Style pizza, but it is so unlike a Chicago Style pizza I refuse to discuss it anymore for fear I will throw my keyboard in rage. A quick look at their corporate website and you will note that this place has dozens, if not hundreds of locations, with only one in Chicagoland (Elk Grove, on the Iowa side of O'Hare).So why does this patently offensive joint get an 'A-OK'? The thin crust pizza was pretty good. It was not New York Style, but the cheese had the same saltiness and was cooked to perfection: crispy, with slightly orange cheese, and served hot as hell but not yet burnt. I had it with basil and roasted garlic, which were chopped up and added under the cheese and complimented the pizza very well. Their Cheesy Garlic bread is absolutely divine; I have to get that again next time. They also have beer. Basically every mainstream domestic and popular import you have ever heard of. About 30 on tap. Not as many obscure micros and craft beers as you will find at the Pig and Crane Alley or even at Radio Maria, Boltini and Seven Saints, but it is a great selection for a chain restaurant. Kinda disappointing in that regard, but understandable as this is obviously a company that buys thousands, if not millions of barrels yearly and is not interested in getting a cask here and there.I went on Tuesday night, when they have 1/2 price pizzas and $2.99 Two Brothers' Beers. This made the meal much more palatable. My 14\" thin crust pizza full price would have been about $15-16 with 2 toppings, which is a little much for a pizza that feeds two (they say 2-3, but dont do that to yourself). Service was great. Jacob (Jake) was attentive, efficient, and accurate. He was courteous and intuited our needs. We were playing trivia there via the NTN boxes, so of course he always seemed to come by when a question was being asked, but that is just how life seems to work.They have a ton of TVs, most of which are flatscreen HD. They also have a bunch of very high quality video games including new golden tee and new safari hunter as well as a few others. This would be an excellent place to watch a game.So, the experience was pretty darn good, even if it was in an obnoxious corporate atmosphere. Prices would have been a little higher than is reasonable for Chambana, but I went on a night with a deal (check their website for that). Had a talented server, and that made all the difference.",

The location since changed to a different restaurant per property owners choice, which upset a lot of guests and staff. Now that I'm in Champaign for business over the next 6 weeks, I jumped at the chance to go in for a few of my favorites! Of course, since the last time I had Old Chicago food, the menu has changed... But for the BETTER! I went in thinking I knew exactly what I would order, but I found myself reading the entire menu trying to choose from the new, or sticking with my old favorites. I ended up choosing a favorite, the Chi-Town Trio (formerly, Signature Trio) which consists of small portions of the Italian Nachos, Cheesy Garlic Bread and the Pepperoni Rolls. I also took the Chopped Salad to-go for lunch for the next day. Aside from the menu choices, I had an excellent dining experience. Upon walking in I was greeted by the hostess who honored my request to sit at a comfy booth. I told her I used to work at an OC and she engaged in polite conversation about when and where. Awesome. Then my server Bradley was just so polite and courteous. Dining alone and totally beat from a long day at work as a restaurant manager, it was refreshing to have such great service. He perfectly timed out my dine in order with my take out order and presented my check just as I was about to ask for it. He even anticipated my thoughts and brought me a fresh side of marinara to take home with me for the last Pepperoni Roll and Cheesy Garlic Bread slice I had left. Needless to say, I'll be back over the course of my business trip. I can't wait to try some of the new entrees and snack on my old favorites. Well done, OC-Champaign!",

Me and my boyfriend came here after hearing my sister and brother in law rave it, however we were beyond disappointed. First, it took the bartender over 10 minutes to even acknowledge us and another 10 to get us our beers. When we were finally asked for refills, the wrong beers were brought to us. Please dont ask us if we want the same thing when you dont remember what kind if beer we ordered to begin with.I ordered the calzone and got a pizza, when I corrected the bartender, she assured me my CORRECT order was on its way. This time I actually did get a calzone, but it had the one ingredient I could not eat...the dreaded peppers. The bartender got her manager who informed me it was my fault because I wouldn't eat peppers...I kindly explained to her through clenched teeth, that I ordered the sausage and spinach calzone NOT one with peppers. I declined any further offers for corrections and left hungry in fear if a lugee being launched in my food. That was only my meal.My boyfriend ordered fish and chips (at a pizza place, I have no idea why). His one request was for coleslaw as a side, he never got it....even after multiple requests....big surprise. He was also looking forward to the savory vinegar described on the menu that would coat his fries...that was not present either, even after he asked again for it. To the managers credit, she did comp our meals (even though I never got one) and gave us a gift certificate for a future visit.We decided to give it another try tonight and ran into the same issues...slow service, wrong orders and being blamed when the wrong stuff is brought out. I have honestly lost respect for my sister and brother in law for recommending this place and all of the other patrons who frequent this establishment. Shame on you!",

The wait staff is well trained and actually competent; the bad news is that they can only serve what the kitchen prepares.Our orders:Appetizer for 2 - artichoke & spinach dip. Served in a round smallish soup type bowl, this awful tasting, white looking glop that looked to have been slopped in the bowl with a large kitchen spoon should have been a clue as to what was to follow. We didn't eat any of it nor we're we offered a refund on this unbelievably bad dish.Main course - \"Tuscan\" pizza, deep dish (what the hell. It's supposed to be a \"Chicago\" place, no?) We were lead to believe that, among other things, the pizza would be served with sauted spinach and chicken breast. What was delivered arrived with approx 5 to 6 leaves if spinach in the center and some rock hard \"chicken\" bites that I'd bet dollars to donuts was what's known as \"chunked and formed.\"Later that night I had, shall we say, terrible gastric distress.SO NOT VISIT THIS PLACE!!",

They had a Mexican thick crust which was interesting. I also tried the Stromboli and I really liked it. A soup or salad is included with the pizza bar. The server will bring you the salad. They make their own ranch dressing and that's a plus in my book. You get a chocolate chip cookie with your ticket. And it is really good. This is NOT Chicago style pizza. I'm not sure why they chose that name. Unless there is something I am not aware of. When I go to Chicago I have Chicago style pizza like Gino's. Now that's a Chicago style pizza!",

The lunch pizza buffet comes with soup/salad, the buffet which has breadsticks, some kind of stramboni things, and various mix of pizzas. they give you a choc-chip cookie for dessert. The pizza is good, but I wouldn't say it's the best in town, or \"chicago\" style pizza. The buffet sometimes doens't have any \"normal\" pizza up there. Ususally you can ask the waitress to request they make a certain pizza though. But sometimes they have some very weird stuff up there like cheeseburger pizza, pinapple and ham, or whatever they feel like on any given day. Also it seems they always want to put me on the farthest side away from the buffet as possible on lunch even when there are a ton of open tables around the lunch buffet (which most people get during lunch hours). I hate having to walk aroudn the entire bar to get to the buffet. I realize I could just ask to sit closer, but when I  tell the hostess 2 for the bufet, I almost want to see where they will sit me, and they always sit me the farthest booth away from the buffet as possible.",

A few days ago we stopped there for the 2nd time while in Champaign, and I thought the pizza was so good the first time that I ordered it again this time. My husband also ordered the same thing! I got an individual size thin crust cheese pizza with extra cheese and it's a great pizza. Hubby got the double mushroom swiss burger again. This thing is huge. My child got the pepperoni rolls and gives them a \"9\" on a scale of 1-10. The first time we were there our server was Josh, and he was fantastic. I used to be a waitress, so I always appreciate and tip good wait staff. I asked him questions about different things on the menu, and he was able to answer confidently. He refilled our drinks without being asked to. Checked on us multiple times. Just great service. Our waitress the second time wasn't so hot, but we will for sure be eating here again.",

This is anything but an anonymous place, and the staff is always willing to cater to special requests, talk about new menu items, or just hang out. My personal favorite items are the falafel sandwich (which they made with fries inside especially for me!), the pizza, and the fries.",

Aaron Stevens and Matt Harsh work in the kitchen, occasionally with a student (like myself) who will help out. The lunch is non-meat, so tuna melts, grilled cheese, pizza slices, and BYOB's (build your own bagel) are the standard fare. They also do some really tasty nacho fries, which is jalapenos, cheese, tomatoes, and onions on seasoned french fries.",

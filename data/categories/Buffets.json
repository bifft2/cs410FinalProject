We've recently moved to Urbana from California and have been craving good bubble tea. We came in near closing time (9:30, not 9:00 as yelp indicated). They were friendly enough but it took them about 15 minutes to bring our drinks (we finally ended up with a regular and green milk tea after she told us they were out of half the flavors we requested). My hopes were quickly falling as each minute passed. Finally she brought the drinks out of the back, a partially open kitchen next to a sad looking buffet. My husband paid $8 total for our drinks which had a pitiful amount of tapioca balls in them. After my first drink I knew the tapioca balls were so so old, who knows how long they've been there?! Both teas were weak and sickly sweet. We couldn't finish and realized that was an $8 lesson well learned. Please don't get tea there. You are much better off trying Chatime down the street!",

After waiting an hour for the replacement food to come I called to make sure it was coming, only to be yelled at and told my problem wasn't that big and they were too busy to be bothered with me and then hung up on.

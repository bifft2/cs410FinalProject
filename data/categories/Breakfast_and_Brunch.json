Two highly recommended plates you can order are the Shish Taouk (chicken kebab) or Breaded Tilapia (one of their specials).

However, I did catch them complaining about a customer who wanted her order done sooner. They talk about that customer as if she was in the wrong. Another problem are the extremely small tables. Its greatest strength are its really good prices. The breakfast special is $4.75 I believe for two eggs, two pancakes, and two sausages or bacon. It costs $6 if you want to include the misnamed American fries and coffee. Their \"American\" fries is actually very soft hash browns.",

The. World.How is it so good?  That's a good question.  Somehow the combination of totally ordinary white bread and totally ordinary pancake batter transcends the potential of both parts to result in something truly drool-worthy: a giant slab of golden brown toast in a pool of butter and syrup.  If you like French toast, there's no reason to consider anything else on the menu.BUT if you do, you'll find that they also have grits - a rarity above the Mason-Dixon line - swimming in butter, crispy bacon, truly over-medium eggs, and delicious pancakes.  The coffee is, well, blackish, but it's really not fair to judge a diner on the quality of their coffee.  Your mug will always be full, for better or for worse.My husband and I moved away from Champaign in 2007 but make a point of having breakfast at Sam's whenever we're back.  There are better-for-us breakfasts in Champaign.  There are fancier breakfasts in Champaign.  But there's only one Sam's, and we'll keep coming back as long as it sticks around.",

The cafe itself is nothing to brag about, just a small, non-elegant, bread-and-butter diner type of place. The food was good though. They had four items on their dinner menu, each being either $7 or $7.50, including tax:1. Shish Taok. Small chicken breast pieces, fried in a garlic sauce. recommended. 2. Kibbe. I don't recommend it. A mixture of some sort and then fried, tasted strange.3. Kafta. Their main beef meal. By far the best food they had. Very tasty.4. Falafel. It was ok. nothing to brag about. They had a special meal that night, for $12, which had fried rice and cooked chicken. It was ok.Each meal comes with a choice of two meals. We all got homous, and tabolli, both of them being delicious. In fact, I think the homous was their best food! Btw, warm pita bread keeps coming, which was a nice touch.There are three Lebanese ladies who do the whole Lebanese dinner thing (Sam's cafe doesn't cater dinners on any other night other than the mentioned two). They were friendly and nice people.",

It's so cute because they serve it on the same crappy styrofoam plates that you'd expect a crumby diner to serve you a greasy burger on, but the Lebanese cuisine is of a quality that could (and IMHO should!) be served at a way fancier place for way more money.What a cool place.

The only reason you'd need a full order is if you intend to split it with someone!  Basically hash browns, they were delicious.  Crispy bits mixed with soft buttery masses of potato that leave a little bit of grease on the plate.  Sounds disgusting?  Trust me, it's awesome.Considering the simplicity of our order, it seemed like it took a while to get our food.  The wait wasn't ridiculous by any means, just a little longer than I expected.  Still, we were in and out within an hour.The atmosphere is probably going to take a few visits to grow on me.  It felt cramped.  Once we settled into our little nook I felt more comfortable.  Clearly, if you're coming here, you're coming for the food...not the ambiance.And the food is indeed good.  GREAT, even.  I'll be back...for more decadent french toast...and scrumptious hash browns...",

The place is pretty small so if you have more than 6 people, it's not happening. Strangely for as small as the place is, I've never waited for a table, even in a busy Saturday morning. There is like one server/busboy/cashier and he is awesome. Love this place!",

French toast is unique and excellent, and the breakfast special is exactly what it is supposed to be - eggs, sausage (or bacon), toast, American potatoes, and coffee, and prepared how you like it.Everything including a milk for the daughter is $20 with tip.Service is awesome - everyone is super-friendly.1/2 star reserved for the inconvenience of not accepting credit/debit cards - that would make this place 5 stars!

It has this crispy outer area and is drenched in cinnamon sugar, and perfect with syrup or without.  A half order is plenty one, but go all out and get the full order!  You'll be glad you did.Prices are great, I think a burger is under $3.00!  I have never ordered anything other than french toast and hash browns.  The hash browns are darn good too. The place is a little dumpy- poster boards on the ceiling, really uncomfortable chairs, broken equipment sitting out in the open, tables go uncleaned for awhile.  But none of this matters, it's clean enough and the food is soooo good!Side-note: they only take cash.  So go to the ATM right now, get some cash (you won't need more than $15 for two) and head over to Sam's cafe and order the french toast!",

She explained every item on the menu for the noobs and really seemed to care about us and our experience.

My husband and I came with two other friends, with whom we seldom agree on where to eat.  I was curious about this place, but wasn't holding out extremely high hopes, since one of my dining companions is from the Middle East and has sky-high standards for Middle Eastern cuisine.  All these problems melted away, however, when we tried Sam's.  Even my Middle Eastern friend was impressed.  Service is quite friendly and lightning fast, and although the menu is limited, everything is delicious!  All the entrees are very reasonably priced and include such classics as falafel, kafte, hummus, and tabbouleh (which was especially delicious!).  All the dinners come with a choice of two side dishes (hummus, Greek salad, or tabbouleh).  The baklava is the best I've ever had.  One caveat:  They do not accept credit cards, so make sure you have cash on hand.  Not knowing this caused my husband to make an emergency ATM run, but the baklava was waiting for him when he returned, so all was well.I'm thrilled that we found this place; it is a treasure!  My friends and I will now never have to argue about where to go out to eat, and that is amazing in and of itself.",

Okay, in my Harley riding days, I've eaten at many greasy spoons that turned out dynamite food.  Not the case here.  Service was perfunctory but that could be owing to the place being so busy.  Coffee was decent.  Ordered the Western Omelet.  Huge.  To their credit, it was filled with slices of bacon instead of just pieces, slices of ham instead of diced pieces, and large pieces of sausage patties.  That having been said, the vegetables were soggy and the entire omelet lacked seasoning of any kind.  Totally bland.  The American Fries were a soggy mess and also without flavor.  Had to have at least a half order of their much ballyhooed French Toast after reading the rave reviews here.  Blah!!  Did these reviewers eat the same stuff as I did?  There was nothing remotely commendable about it.  It was soggy and relatively flavorless.  I tried it with and without syrup.  The syrup at least gave it flavor, albeit that of low grade imitation maple syrup.  It's been a while since I left that much food on my plate.  This may be a case of the Emperor's New Clothes as it is with so many of the \"In\" places in C-U.  \"Oh look, we found this quaint little cafe downtown; you must try it.\"  Of course, if you disagree you are obviously declasse.

I really would like to see some Lebanese cuisine on the menu although Sam doesn't think he has the right clientelle.  He is a very sweet man and his brother was just in from Lebanon.  I noticed a Saint perched above the grill. He offtered to share one with me for protection.  He said I should place it above a door way of my home.  How cool is this guy anyway..",

Sams is my favorite place for breakfast in Chambana.  A big reason for that is the French Toast.  It is simply the best I have every had.  The rest of the food is good, but I can rarely get myself to order anything but that. Wait staff is friendly and efficient.  This is a great place for friends to grab a some food before heading up to a tailgate or after a great night out in Champaign.  Sams is definitely a diamond in the rough.",

Granted, they did take 30% off after we said something, but the food wasn't even that impressive. I'm definitely never going back.",

I wanted a Denver omelette but their version had onions, tomatoes, and ham instead of the expected onions, peppers, and ham.  Oh well, I ordered it anyway.  It was very good and PIPING hot.  I burned my mouth on the end when I started eating, and on the middle part several minutes later.  I also got a short stack of flapjacks for \"dessert\" and they were okay.  Top it all off with a cold glass of OJ and you have yourself a decent breakfast for $10.16.  I was here around 9 am on Sunday, and had no trouble getting the seat of my choice.  When I left, it was close to filling up, and I don't doubt that the college kids roll in here starting mid-morning.",

I have been hearing about Sam's breakfast, in particular the french toast, for months now.  I love french toast, it is my favorite breakfast food.  I wasn't expecting much, thinking that it was sure to be less fantastic than my boyfriend claimed it to be.Sam's is the epitome of a greasy spoon.   No frills decor, you walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom and your table is likely to be wobbly.  The server took care of us but was busy with other tables so the service was polite and attentive but short and sweet.  We each ordered a breakfast special and then split an order of french toast.  The breakfast special items (eggs, meat, toast, hashbrowns) were basic but good.  The french toast?  Ridiculous.  Seriously, the best french toast I've ever had.  The cook dips the bread in thinned out pancake batter and then fries it up.  It is rich, crispy and seasoned with powdered sugar and cinnamon.  It was a tasty breakfast on a cold, rainy day.  When the Illini basketball team walked in the door, my boyfriend was in heaven.  At the end of the meal we realized that we didn't have any cash and Sam's doesn't take cards.  Because my boyfriend was a regular in his college days, Gus, the owner, was nice enough to let us leave, get some cash and come back to pay.  Our total was about as pleasing as the french toast.  12 bucks and change for two coffees, two specials and french toast.  Crazy cheap.  Sam's is far away from home, but we'll visit everytime we're in Champaign.",

Two slabs of French toast lathered in pancake batter and cooked into the most delectable squishy crispness you can imagine. Do your mouth a favor (flavor?), and order it.

The building is new and the whole interior feels fresh and bright--just want you want when enjoying your breakfast.While I sometimes enjoy a \"luxury\" bagel (with crunchy cinnamon or other ingredients baked into the batter), I usually stick to more conventional flavors.  I love the selection of \"plain\" bagel flavors at Einstein: honey whole wheat, sesame, potato, pumpernickle, etc.  The bagels themselves are delicious, but the real silver lining is the schmears (flavored, whipped cream cheeses).  I swear by the honey-flavored schmear, subtly sweet with a sprinkling of almonds.Sometimes I stop in after work to pick up a batch of bagels for breakfast.  By the late afternoon, the display case has often been plucked clean by earlier crowds.  I'm not sure if there are more bagels waiting in back, but if so, I wish they'd keep their front case stocked.",

That amount of money should be the normal amount for a meal so the drinks have to be bought separately. With that said, their food is of high quantity in comparison to many other restaurant establishments. Out of the myriad of panini places I've eaten at, this is one of the few places where the panini actually makes me full. It's just a darn shame that quality was most definitely sacrificed for quantity.",

They also have iced coffee priced less than their competitors and I love the vanilla hazelnut! If you come for lunch, you can add a side of cream cheese and change the bread/bagel your sandwich comes on at no charge which is a huge perk.",

The bagel was untoasted, which was the only thing that I disliked (aside from the small size)--bagels are one of those foods that needs to be heated up...seriously...who eats untoasted bagels?Anyway, it was a pretty good sandwich but way too ridiculously expensive for the tiny size.  Wouldn't have been worth it at all if not for the coupon we had.  $7 for a small bagel with \"schmear\" (ughhh that word gives me the willies), some sprouts and a few veggies?  Seriously?  My boyfriend ordered a panini, also ridiculously small, with potato salad on the side, for $8.  The potato salad was pretty nasty--he couldn't even finish it.We also had iced coffee, which is probably the only thing I'll get from here in the future.  I dunno, maybe I'll get a bagel or something if I have a coupon but overall I felt like the prices just didn't make sense for the amount of food you get.  You can go to a nice local place and get larger servings of better food for the same price.They do have a parking lot, which is a plus, and the seating and atmosphere is nice.  Probably would be a decent place to grab a coffee and do some homework but I wouldn't really bother with their food.",

I have gone to this Einstein location twice early in the morning to get a baker's dozen and two \"Joe to Go\" coffee containers to provide breakfast at a presentation.  Both times I did not call ahead of time but each time the staff was quick, helpful, and kind.  I was worried they would have trouble accommodating my order since I basically walked in the door without notice but they had no issues.  They provide creamer, sweeteners, stirrers, coffee cups, and knives for the cream cheese.  They have a great system so that everything is organized and you have everything you need.  I also appreciated that they helped me bring the bagels and coffee out to my car.  The only downside is that the bakers dozen, two containers of cream cheese, and two big things of coffee (one regular and one decaf) came to $50 which is not cheap.  However, they have great quality food and coffee and when you think about all the extras they throw in, it is actually a pretty reasonable price.  I would recommend going to Einstein for anyone who needs a last minute spread for a conference or presentation!",

Yet over the past 60 days or so... the amount of lox on my lox and bagel, everything bagel, double toasted has been less and less... it's somewhat startling when you think how much money EBB will save by taking an ounce of lox here and there off of your sandwich multiplied by the number purchased worldwide in 24 hours.  i'm all for conservation but in this case, NIMBY.soooo, i brought it to the attention of the manager today... the ginger one.  and his first response was \"Really?\"and i thought to myself... no, i'm making this up so you and i can have a conversation, by the way, how's the wife and kids?  Yes, REALLY, otherwise i wouldn't speak up... NITWIT!!!while i'm thinking to myself, the manager says \"let me show you something\" and quickly exits to the kitchen.at almost the same time the server hands me my bagel. i choose to exit quickly having expressed my concern over the ever diminishing quantity of lox and quality of the lox and bagels being sold.by this time, i've already decided that this is my last visit for awhile, so as i walk out the door, instead of my customary \"see you later\" i said \"GOODBYE\"soooo, i get to work, open my lox and bagels... and sonofab*tch... they didn't toast my bagel!!!i'm done with EBB at this location.you can kiss this multiple purchases per week customer goodbye.",

The employees here are outstanding and friendly, and I am paying attention to how they treat new customers. There is no drop off in the kindness they show to between regulars and first time visitors. In fact, my wife and three boys all love this place too, even though they don't know their names!I have had breakfast and lunch here, and I have catered a breakfast using this location. The bagels are as close to a New York bagel that you can find in Chambana. The cream cheese flavors are excellent! (Try the smoked salmon on an asiago bagel!) If you were really pressing me to find something to gripe about it would be a minor item that I consider ultimately unimportant to the overall dining experience. That item is simply this. When I get coffee, the lids are on one side of the coffee bar and the cream and sweetener are on the other. Since I put the lid on last, I have to go back and get the lid, when I've got everything else ready to go. (I did mention it was an utterly unimportant non-issue, no?)So, trust me. If you are looking for a trustworthy breakfast place, Einstein Bros is where its at. The real secret that not many people know about is how good they are at lunch. Try the soup. Try a Thintastic Chicken Pesto. And tell 'em Sean sent you, and see what happens!",

It's not a bad place: It has a charming, homey atmosphere, the staff is always pleasant (if a bit distant), and the food comes reasonably quickly. But that's where the aforementioned not-right-ness comes in: the food is just not great. I haven't tried everything, but it feels like they're cutting corners and doing it in all the wrong places. So on Saturday I ordered the La Petit French toast. I am guessing the 'petit' part refers to the amount of eggs and heat used in making the dish. In my cookbook, 'toast' should definitely have a bit of crisp to it, and French toast involves the use of eggs. This was more like 'heated bread'. I will cop to liking my french toast on the eggy side, but I could not honestly tell whether they used eggs or not. These reminded me of pancakes at IHOP: bland tasting black holes for syrup. Another reviewer said LP is like Pancake House only more expensive. Have to disagree with that: I have never had a meal I didn't love at OPH, and Cracker Barrel is soul food for this honky. Hey Le Peep, give your menu a once-over, and give the other guys a run for their money.",

However, they definitely worked super fast and we got seated in less than 30 minutes. Being a big fan of American dining, I had always be using skillets as my control group to test the quality of the restaurant. Hearing only good things about this place, I had relatively high expectations. And long behold, this place does not disappoint.I first ordered a strawberry creme smoothie. It came in a chilled glass mug. Upon first sip, I could taste the strawberries. Not many restaurants can do that. Within a few minutes I decided to order the Blarney Skillet because I am always a sucker for corned beef. The food was served within 10-15 minutes. And Dear God, did the combination of both hit the spot! The skillet itself is not greasy, yet you feel like you are eating something substantial. The taste of the ingredients are further complemented by the hollandaise sauce, which was mixed with the two sunny-side-up eggs to perfect the combination. The waiter/waitresses were very attentive. They constantly swung by to ensure that we have enough water as my buddies and I just chatted after we finish our meals. They were super polite and gives great insight when asked to provide recommendations of items on the menu. The best part about this place is probably the price. The two items: smoothie and skillets, came to a combined total of approximately $12 including tax, which is not bad at all! I would highly recommend this place if you have a mean of transportation to get here!",

However, there are things to improve on that need attention.One time we went there, our waitress said that they \"don't take credits cards at the table\", which is total BULL because all the other waitresses that served us there did. It seemed that she didn't feel like doing her job, or that she felt \"superior\" to us.Another time, we learned through the manager that they carefully measure every portion of potatoes per plate...he said every plate \"only gets\" 8oz per serving. He wasn't so friendly and he cut us off while talking.Today I went and got their Seafood Crepes for $7.75. The dish says it is stuffed with seafood...A total LIE.It is ONLY stuffed with cheap *imitation* crab meat, wrapped with a couple layers of oily egg. Gross! If you don't know what imitation crab meat is, it's not real crab meat. You can get it under $4.00 at walmart!Looking at the plate, I immediately realized they were not using real seafood, so I told the waitress Patti about it. Thankfully she was human and decent about it and did not charge us for the plate, in light of how the plate description was *not honest*.We left and I am not sure I will be returning.",

(concentrate your excellence, restaurants of the world!)  i ordered the \"wheat\" pancakes.  my friend ordered some sort of breakfast hodge podge called \"the eighteen wheeler\"..... the name alone suggests impressiveness.  she does not eat pork, and asked if anything could be substituted for the pork sausage included in the meal.  the answer was no, but for an extra charge, you can add fruit or toast or \"sassy apples\"... whatever in the hell that is.  substitutions are not a part of the extensive menu.  our food came rather quickly for a sunday morning.  i was disappointed to find that my \"wheat\" pancakes were not wheat at all.  they were in fact regular old un-nutritious pancakes with wheat germ delicately sprinkled atop.  sigh.  the potatoes were okay.  my friend said her meal was alright.  nothing special, but nothing to really complain about.  the waitress was nice and attentive.  she made sure our drinks were never empty and she was pleasant.  would i return?  maybe.  maybe not.",

We sat at the breakfast bar and it was like sitting in someone's house. Looks aren't everything.We got the coffee, the biscuit and gravy side, Nomad skillet, and sausage pie skillet. All phenomenal. I had low expectations for the gravy, and when it came out I fell in love with it. I had no idea gravy could be that good. The skillets were beautifully presented and 10 levels tastier than any of the breakfast options in Chambana. They really know how to make a good skillet.",

You can also get flavored coffee, though with a few less options.I went for the irish benedict and a cafe mocha. Both were about on par with the usual high standards that come with the name. One issue was that the poach was perfect on one of the eggs but a little overdone on the other. Not a huge deal, but the yolk mixing with the corn beef hash is the star of that meal. The only thing that makes Le Peep lose points with me is that I got tagged a little extra for exchanging the ever-present diced potatoes for fresh fruit. After corn beef hash, an english muffin, two poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce the last thing I need are these dry, starchy and very overrated potatoes. I'm used to asking for fruit instead, and this is the first time I was charged extra. Wasn't happy about that, but it doesn't change the fact that I'll be back here pretty often.",

The portion was big, the ham actually tasted like ham, and the potatoes were scrumptious. There was even hot sauce already on the table!

That is why I never go back to Le Peep. Merry Ann's, Sam's Cafe, Pancake House and Courier Cafe are all better than Le Peep in one way or another, be it speed, price, quality, or selection. Le Peep is fine, especially for a chain, and offers an interesting variety of items for higher than average prices, but it ain't gonna wow you.",

Also tried the garden omelette which was very light and also delicious. Unfortunately the coffee was sub par, but most diner coffees are. Overall, the service was great and food was good, and the comfortable, happy atmosphere of Le Peep definitely makes it worth visiting.",

This is central Illinois, after all.  The biggest difference between LA brunch and Champaign brunch?  Grease.  Those midwesterners LOVE their grease.  My parents are born and raised C-Uers, and I have to giggle when they talk about how healthy the food is at Le Peep.  True, it's an improvement on most of what you'll find in the area... and true, the world of scrambled tofu and turkey bacon is quite a different one, so not an altogether fair comparison... but it's still funny to me.",

I went to the location in CU and requested 2 eggs cooked in plain oil, side of potatoes, and a side salad with no cheese and oil/vinegar for dressing.  The potatoes are prepackaged and seasoned with onion powder.  Onions have been identified as my biggest allergy.  I asked if they had any other potatoes they could cut up and cook in some oil and was sadly told no. I asked if I could have a side salad with extra veggies.  I also asked if there was a possibility to get the chef salad with no meat and substitute the imitation crab on the salad. I was told no to every possibility I came up with.  The server seemed annoyed and didn't assist me with any other options.  I ended up with 2 eggs and a bowl of plain oatmeal. I know with allergies/food triggers, we can be annoying customers.  However, we often are willing to pay more and tip more if we are treated respectfully and the server/chef help make our experience a positive one.

Very fresh and tasty. Not to mention filling. Had a few bites of the accompanying potatoes, not my fave, but I was too full anyway. They had a wide variety of dishes, and many healthy options. My only complaint was the \"fresh squeezed\" orange juice. At  four bucks a pop for a large glass, I'm better off getting a half gallon at the Jenifer Street Market back home for double that price--and it's SO much better.",

The food doesn't have too much flavor to it, and if you get over that, it's decent.The last time I went, I only wanted to go because I had a free meal to redeem from the punch cards they have. Now, I had two different cards with punches that both added up to a full card. You would think that they could add those two cards together to redeem my meal. However, when I was at the stand to redeem the card, the host wouldn't let me because the punches were on two separate cards. She told me that she could combine all of the punches on one card for me so that I could come back the next time and redeem it. That was SO generous of her. When I grudgingly paid, the host also looked at the signature line of my credit card that said \"SEE ID.\" So, she asked me, \"Do you want me to look at your ID?\" I answered no. She asked the same question to the lady behind me that paid. I'm pretty sure that asking that question defeats the purpose of writing that in the signature line. I'm not one to even care if people check my ID, but phrasing a question like that just showed the ignorance of the employees at this restaurant.The servers have always been nice, it's just the hosts (and manager I believe) that were incredibly disappointing. I won't be returning.",

And while it has been clear to me for quite sometime that the quality of my experience here has been on the decline, I've been in denial... until today. Sunday brunch is tradition for me and a handful of my girlfriends. We literally do it in some form every weekend. Today we went and well... where should I start? Our waiter was completely aloof. We waited at least 10 minutes, in a moderately busy bar for a whiskey soda (don't judge us for loving whiskey. It's always 5pm on Sunday Funday). No biggie though. My steak and poached eggs were not hot when delivered to my table. No biggie though. But when one of my girlfriends ordered a salad with slide of shrimp and was brought 2 shrimp ... like what?? (Look at the picture!) In what restaurant world is this ok? $3 for 2 shrimp? They should have brought her 3 oz of shrimp (an actual serving) for whatever the cost. But 2 shrimp? Don't be petty. That's so petty, and as much as I love Radio brunch when it is done right, I think I need my space until they get it together. Mind you I'm still annoyed they gave up their late night menu but that's another post for another day...",

I thought the menu items were decently priced, maybe a bit overpriced for the quantity and quality of the food.  I ordered three tapas dishes - the grilled plantains, the goat cheese, and the beef tacos.  The goat cheese was fried and served with honey and bread and it was absolutely delicious!  The plantains were pretty plain, but still a nice change of pace from what I normally eat day to day.  The beef tacos were tasty, but they were incredibly hard to eat when served in dry corn shelled tortillas.  They cracked and fell apart so it was a bit frustrating to end up having to eat a taco with a fork.  Our service was absolutely terrible, I had to flag down the host at one point to get my water glass refilled, and she brought out all of our food at different times which was a bit strange.  Overall, I was happy with the food I ordered and how it was prepared and how it tasted - were talking about Champaign, Illinois, not Chicago or New York - and unhappy with the service.  I wouldn't tell someone not to go there, because it is a unique restaurant for this area, but I would be warned that the service will likely be disappointing.",

I'm definitely the kind of person that would rather sit on the curb next to a taco truck stuffing myself with a $6 burrito than go to a fancy restaurant (the kind of place where you don't where cargo shorts) where there's more empty space on my plate than food. That being said, of all the more expensive places to eat around town, Radio Maria takes the cake for me. First off, the restaurant has a GREAT atmosphere. The setting/lighting is damn near perfect and they have great outside seating if the weather is nice. There's weird kitschy crap all over the walls and table too, which I mean as compliment. On top of that I've never had anything but a pleasant experience dealing with the staff. All the waiters/waitresses and hosts were extremely friendly and conversational. But really though, how's the food? Well, it's also great. Every time I look at the menu (for tapas especially) it's a lot of fun. For those who don't know there are two menus regularly available here, one that is a more traditional appetizer/entree menu and on that is for tapas dishes. There's good variety in terms of vegetarian and non-veggie dishes and the prices aren't outrageous for a place of this caliber. The paella is a definite must every time I go and on one day of the week (Tuesday?) they have 1/2 off wine bottles! Speaking of booze they have a full bar and a great selection of wines and beers as well as house infused liquors rotating every week or so which is really neat. While cocktails are always the thing to break the bank sometimes I just can't resist! All in all this is a great restaurant and one of my favorite CU establishments. I certainly won't be dining there very often but on a special occasion they're always high up on my list of options.P.S. I've heard from a number of sources that their weekend brunch is both delicious and slightly more affordable than their regular weekday selections. If/when I verify this I'll make sure to update my review.",

For this, it gets at least one more star to land at 4.",

It's something you won't regret trying. It's sweet and has a strong cinnamon flavor. Service was pretty slow, but we were okay with that this time. I highly recommend going to Radio Maria for brunch!

I was just the hostess, who said that a waiter would be over in a minute. That minute was another 7 minutes, and we didn't even have a drink order in, so we got up to leave (as we were super hungry.) The hostess shrugged and was totally unapologetic about the terrible service, so we went to jupiter's and had some delicious pizza and beers for 1/4 the price of what we were going to order.",

C-U does a good job of disproving this (and at times, an amazingly disgusting job of proving it correct) but Radio Maria is my number one choice.Their brunch menu features typical brunch/breakfast items; omelettes (lots of options for fillings), other egg creations, sandwiches, etc. My mom is a big fan of their crab cakes, and I believe my dad always gets a sandwich of some kind. I always get an omelette, which I always enjoy. Everything (nearly) comes served with their \"beer bread\" which seems to be some kind of beer/corn bread thing that's fantastic. They sell it separately in loaves, last time we were there my parents bought one to take home.The service can be a bit iffy, last time we went our waiter seemed to have forgotten about us as people who were seated later got their food way before we did. But eventually our food came, and he was very apologetic. I don't think this is indicative of their service typically, but from what others have said it may be. Overall though, Radio Maria is not to be missed.",

I love enjoying late afternoon tapas on a warm summer day with great drinks and better friends. I'm not forgetting the great selection of entrees this restaurant/bar offers, but in typical Spanish fashion, I usually fill up on beer and tapas before I can even contemplate dinner. While they don't serve dinner all night long, they do continue serving their most popular tapas until close. So grab a group of friends and head over to Radio Maria soon; the availability of food at all hours makes it a great place to start or end a night downtown!",

The food is good quality, and the flavor always delicious!Tapas menu: the frog's legs (mmm, honey) and roasted asparagus are some of my favorites. A few of the tapas items lack flavor; but in general you won't be disappointed.The desserts I've had are lovely; with good flavor and pretty presentation. The portions of everything are very good - not too much food, but plenty to satisfy you.The wait staff has always been nice and helpful, if a bit distracted sometimes. Friendly people, good service.It's definitely one of my favorite restaurants, I go whenever I get the chance, and recommend it to anyone!Note: Many people have reviewed Radio Maria negatively. I think they need to put it in context of local restaurants. We're in Champaign-Urbana, not New York or Seattle. While we should have high standards, we just don't have the variety (and therefore competition) to create a large foody restaurant culture. I also think they need to stop being so negative. I've had a lovely meal and experience every time I've been to RM; I believe you get out of a place what you put into it (as long as it's moderately good, and this is much better than that).

Yikes! Unfortunately, most of us were underwhelmed with the food.  My wife's Italian omelette lacked a kick--add some fresh garlic, perhaps?  The two of us whose dishes included the \"house made\" chorizo were disappointed at the sausage's lack of flavor--either spice it up or use store-bought, folks!The mediocre food was made up for by the wonderful decor and overall experience.  As a Chicagoan with family in Champaign I'm jealous that a place like this exists, so inexpensive, with so much variety on the menu and 37 beers on tap (next door at the Tapas Bar)!  If they spent some time tweaking the dishes they have and adding that extra something many of them miss, they could become a truly top-notch restaurant for brunch.UPDATE: Went to the tapas-bar portion of RM the other night and was really pleased with the dishes.  A few traditional tapas but mostly inventive twists using spanish ingredients, like lightly battered asparagus with serrano ham and manchego cheese and seared avocado  stuffed with quinoa.  Really tasty stuff, and goes great with one of the 25 draft beers (most of which cost four bucks).",

Drinks are good, Tapas is \"meh\" and pricey, dinner...no...and pricey.  We went last week and I ordered salmon which arrived with sweet potato chips - and a huge fried egg on top.  The fish was okay at best and the odd attempts at nouvelle cuisine were amusing - but tasteless in every sense of the word.In a market as competitive as C-U, I don't see how they can continue this based on anything but location and alcohol.

We were treated well and served professionally as we stayed all evening (7-11 PM). The drinks were good, though I'd say the beer was a bit small for the otherwise fair price. The odd thing is that the food is irrationally high priced - at least for the entrees. Our group of 4 ordered 3 of the specials and 1 menu item. The specials (which are not priced on the board) were simple plates of an entree & a \"decorative\" side. I ordered the Paella from the menu. The Paella was a 6 inch skillet of rice and seafood - 3 or so pieces each of shrimp and scallops, with some hard cooked sausage slices throughout. Good, but not special. Two of the specials were a fillet with a garlic crust - 4 oz of good meat. So what's the issue? Well $30 for the fillet and $24 for the Paella is an outrage for a remodeled VFW in a College town. This pricing is just too much like Soho/Manhattan - but it is Central Illinois! So go for the drinks and the Salsa Dancing after 10:30, but skip the food - it just is not worth it.",

There are lots of good cheeses around this area, so it seems crazy to have a below-average cheese plate.",

They were both fine. Very heavy on mixer. I am one of those weirdos who actually likes to taste the alcohol, the ratio was a bit off. The food is decent as well. I feel as though there have been some odd thing going on with honey on their menu right now, though. Fried eggplant with balsamic vinegar and honey... what? Why? My friend loved it. I tried it. Yuck! Waaaay too sweet. Lots of dishes with honey when i was there last.They clearly know a thing or two about food in the way they pair ingredients most of the time but sometimes it's a miss. To some degree, I appreciate that their menu changes based on what is available, however, I don't appreciate it when I look on the menu and there is only one thing I would consider eating.",

The mexican coffee was delicious, like a spiced coffee with nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove.  My boyfriend said it had a little too much spice for him, but it reminded me of a spiced latte.  The masa boat surprise was tasty, although I recommend getting a little bit of everything in each bite.  Eating just the egg and chorizo can be a little bland, but eating it with the veggies, cheese, salsa, black beans and some of the corn \"boat\" is sooo good.  The smoked pork pozole was really good, although it could have been a dinner item if not for the poached eggs.  It was kind of like a mexican stew with a couple poached eggs, and some beer bread.  The beer bread was very tasty.  We'll definitely be going back and try some other things.  Radio Maria's has a pretty extensive breakfast and lunch menu.",

The torta Maria and smoked port torta are unusual and always good. Each week the brunch specials usually include a special omelette, scrambler, and a sandwich. The omelettes are only OK; somehow they seem a bit dry and overcooked.My main complaint with brunch is the coffee. For my past several visits it's been quite weak and it's hard to get a refill. At a weekend brunch, I do expect good, hot coffee and not to go 20 minutes with my cup empty.For dinner, I think Radio is trying to present itself as more upscale and trendy than it is. A few years ago, the menu had a much more pronounced Carribean/Cuban/South American flair to it, and I miss that. I'm sure everything on the menu is very well-prepared, but it all seems like dishes I can get at any number of places.For my last dinner experienced there, I had a tenderloin special. It consisted of two pieces of tenderloin, one correctly medium, one well-done; six gnocchi (I counted); and a scattering of green peas. I believe the sauce mentioned in the description was absent. We did have a large party, but we were sitting at an empty table for nearly an hour before our food was ready; no salads, no bread. I guess we were expected to order cocktails and appetizers. Everything was tasty and was artistically arranged on an appropriately-trendy rectangular plate, but the portions were quite small. I shouldn't leave a restaurant after a $30 entree feeling a bit peckish.I feel like Radio can't decide what it is. A fancy drink bar? A tapas bar? A haute cuisine restaurant? It does all those things fairly well, but none of them exceptionally.",

Since it was early in the morning on a weekend, we liked to start out our meal with some nice coffee. Not gonna lie, if you are looking to some authentic Mexican coffee, save it. Their coffee was not their highlight. They offered two specials that day: an omelette and a stuffed chili pepper. We listened to our friendly waiter's recommendation and ordered one of each. Their baked potatoes that accompanied the core of the meals were phenomenal! The temperature was perfectly controlled and all the pieces of the potatoes were cooked evenly, and just right. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, with just the right amount of salt to make it appeal to the tongues. It is very hard for me to describe the main courses in details, since there was a lot going on, but just know that food is served in a timely fashion, and the impact of the flavors truly made the visit an overall enjoyable experience. Definitely keep a lookout on the specials if you want something more memorable.  The restaurant itself is very clean, and was decorated with interesting Hispanic things that created an unique atmosphere that made it ideal for 1 on 1 dining. Definitely would return to this place next time I am in town.",

Outside of Blind Pig, this was one of the first true beer bars in the area.Food is interesting.  A mix of tapas, other small plates, and brunch.  Hanger Steak is good, as is the duck.  Not everything is a hit, but there is enough good stuff to keep you coming back.  Like bone marrow, pork shoulder, and ricotta.  This is definitely a place to check out downtown.

They have two menus, one for traditional dinner and one with tapas items. Since I like trying different things, we decided to share 5 small plates.Patatas (bravas): Great crispy potato chunks with some fancy mayonnaise (aioli)  Charcuterie plate: Slightly untraditional plate of four types of meat. Spicy salami-ish meat, serrano ham, duck breast, and bbq crispy pork. The crispy pork was my favorite, but everything was really tasty, especially mixed with the pickled onions. Mussels: Really complex flavorful broth with well cooked and meaty mussels. The toast they came with was top notch, also.Lamb meatballs: Tasty, especially with hidden gems of pine nuts. If you really like meatballs, I definitely recommend these. Garlic shrimp: Four plump and juicy shrimp hanging out on a large piece of toast with a mayo based sauce. I loved these.The decor is slightly art deco, but a little more colorful and whimsical than that. Service was excellent, and I think overall it's a pretty good value for Champaign.

Probably a good thing since I overheard the table next to me complain about how bad the bar service options were.  Sadly, I had to remind the waiter 15 minutes later about my drink.  He apologized, and to his credit admitted that he had forgotten to put the order in.  Sadly, the bloody Mary was very weak and uninspiring when it arrived (tasted like straight up tomato juice with very little to it).  Eventually we were able to place our food order (I got the Migas).  Eventually that food came out.  The food was good. The Migas were crispy because of the cooked in tortilla strips.  It was a good amount of food and very tasty.  I would definitely be willing to try Radio Maria again if I was in the area.  Hopefully the slow service was just a fluke (I got the feeling the waiter was new as he couldn't tell us anything about their waffles as he hadn't seen them yet...).",

Despite having seated most of the tables in the bar side of the restaurant, they seemed to have only one person actively waiting the tables.  It took 10-15 minutes to get our drinks...not cocktails, but diet coke and iced tea.  The waitress was friendly enough when she showed up to the table, but seemed relatively uninterested in doing so.We ordered several items from the tapas menu (no entrees) and other tables that were seated after us received their food before we did.  I agree with the reviewer below that says that tapas should be brought out as they are prepared, not all at once.  But sure enough, 45 minutes later all our food arrives at once.The food itself was all very good to excellent, but in hindsight it's the too cool for school attitude of the waitstaff that stands out in my mind, not the food.  That's a shame.",

You have half of your restaurant empty and those are all reserved?  Ok, I'll bite.  Yes, we'll be happy to sit at the bar and have a drink and wait for \"about 15 minutes.\"At the bar, we order two delicious drinks.  They're made well, even though it took a little longer than it should considering there were three people behind the bar.  We decided to ask for the tapas menu so we'd be ready to order.  Sure, I don't mind that this one has food spilled on it.

For tapas, we ordered fried artichokes with lemon and feta, eggplant frites, seared tuna and the mixed paella. The artichoke hearts and the eggplant were great. The eggplant was drizzled with honey, which really enhanced the dish. The tuna tasted like it was on the verge of going bad. The seasoning was really good. The paella tasted lovely but was lacking the crispy bottom. It's clear they make the paella ahead. The portion was small but just the right amount.",

The tables are decorated underneath and they are unique to every table. There are about 10 tables outside if you like sitting outdoors. The brunch menu may seem overwhelming at first, but you can narrow it down to your dish pretty easily. They have a wide selection of omelets. They also have egg dishes with rice and beans. It includes vegetarian options. I had the guava juice, churros, and smoked pork posole. It hit the spot. Try getting a slice of beer bread! It's hearty and is flavorful. The churros are fluffy and not too sweet. I am not familiar with real churros, but this one tasted good! The service for a Sunday brunch is slow. I had to flag the waiter down to take our order after 15 minutes of sitting and waiting. The tapas menu is extensive. Hands down, my favorite dish to order are the lamb meatballs. They are made with pinenuts and tender lamb and then are stewed in a seasoned tomato sauce. You have to try them! I also love the Paella. There are several different kinds, but I like the mixed because you get to try all the different seafood and meats. It is big, so plan on sharing or gorging yourself in awesomeness. It is on the pricey side, so I would make this the place to go when you want to treat yourself.",

The employee seating us went to get us a table and was sidetracked by another employee at the entrance to the dining room and let us wait for at least 7 min. while he carried on an obvious flirtation/personal conversation with the other employee.  He finally looked away and saw us standing at the front door and that reminded him that we were still waiting.  I'm a relatively patient person but I was considering walking out at eating next door at Bacaro at that point - not because the wait was so long, but because we were so easily forgotten from the get go.  It was rude.The best I can say is that the dinner service left a lot to be desired (our waitress was tired and stressed) and the accoustics of the restaurant are such that larger tables are extremely loud, making it difficult to carry on a conversation in a normal voice.  The food was marginal at best although you have to give them points for creativity.  Wasn't a pleasant experience and my husband became very ill later that evening and lost his meal.  I wouldn't recommend it for dinnertime but may try again for brunch.",

And I'm a sucker for their Crass-esque vintage graphic design.Excellent wine selection.  The Reisling and Gewuiztraminer are my favorites.The service has always been friendly without being intrusive.My food has always been cooked perfectly.I can't say I agree with the claims that the menu is uninspired.  The coffee crusted filet with espresso drizzle and savory vanilla sauce is not exactly something you can get anywhere.  I think there is a fine line in a place like Champaign between daring and scary.  You can tell by the popularity of places like Olive Garden in this town does not have the most adventurous pallate.  Fennel, Saffron, hearts of palm, plantain, poblano chilis, mole... these ingredients are all \"hot\" in celebrity cuisine scene and at the same time pallatable items for most people.  It might not be truffles and quail eggs, but it is modern and accessible.  Oh yeah, and delicious.",

It was a very busy night, but our waitress was obviously assigned to too many tables. It too a long time for her to take our order and she forgot to bring the basket of chips initially. We were also seated by the window and the heating was poor. I was lucky I was wearing a warm dress, because I saw people near us having to wear their jackets while dining. I enjoyed my appetizer of figs with honey and gouda and the chips had a tasty aioli dip, but the main courses were less impressive. I had the Torta Maria, which sounded fascinating, but it ended up being a heap of flavors that really didn't stand out. My date's chicken breast was teeny tiny and he did not enjoy the accompanying slaw. The dessert menu was a bit boring, but the pot de creme was good. I also tried the tapas bar recently, which was a slightly better experience. The salmon skewers with cucumber were perfectly spiced and delectable. The balsamic fruit with manchego on bread was good as well. However, the lamb skewers...they were like meatloaf on a stick. The tapas are a good way to try several dishes, but they are overpriced considering how little you get and that I could probably grill salmon and put it on a stick myself. The exception would have been if the little dishes displayed exceptional artistry, such as Cafe Luna's.",

I remember going almost two years ago when I first visited Champaign, and really enjoying it. I've gone again a couple times after moving here, and I was never disappointed.The restaurant is divided into two different dining rooms: one that serves more traditional entrees, and another (the larger one, where the bar is located) that serves predominantly tapas. I don't really understand why they can't serve both types of food in both rooms seems it looks like they share the same kitchen, but that's a detail. I would recommend going for the tapas (the other room is a little more *stuffy*). I've now tried a bunch of dishes, and everything has been good if not very good. A few highlights among the tapas that I tried: the spicy shrimp in chile-lime sauce are delicious, as are the anchovies (if you like anchovies, that is), and the scallops. They also usually have a bunch specials, which I would recommend trying. Not to forget, they have an extensive wine list (including a pretty good selection of wine by the glass), and a full bar. The drinks are particularly cheap (at least compared to NYC prices that I am used to), and I'm always amazed at how low the bill is in the end: you can have a really nice meal with alcohol for $40 to $50, which is a pretty good deal considering the quality of the food. The service has also always been good.  4-1/2 stars.",

I looked it up online and they seemed to have a wide array of choices, when I saw the actual menu, I think there were 5 entree choices, in addition to a wide variety of tapas.  On top of that, the one dish I wanted, was sold out, so I went with the Smoked Duck and Brie Pizza.  I mean, it was OK, there was a good amount of duck on the pizza but the whole time I was craving more brie!!  They could have seriously doubled the amount of brie on the pizza and it still might not have been enough, I could hardly taste it.  Also, it wasn't really a pizza at all, more like a cold flatbread, so be forewarned.  I also ordered a small side salad.  It was a delicious spinach salad, but lived up to the \"small\" definition....AND it was $6--give me a break.  If I'm looking to drink, maybe I'll stop by next time I'm in town, but I'll hit up K.O.

Radio Maria is my favorite restaurant in Champaign.  The food is top-notch and the atmosphere is one of a kind.  But my wife and I had their Valentine's day menu this past weekend.  The food was great, but not for the outrageous cost.  It was $50/person plus drinks for a \"tasting\" menu that wouldn't have filled up a mouse.  Normally the value/price ratio is excellent.  I always felt like the food was worth the cost, but not the valentine's day fixed menu.  The high price combined with lack luster service took the sizzle out of what could have been a hot night.",

However, last night when we were there, the rice of the paella we ordered is not fully cooked. It was stiff and hard to chew. Although they sent it back to re-cook, the rice still comes back partially done. We ended up canceling the order. This is unbelievable. It seems that they cannot manage to get the rice cooked and the chef failed to solve the problem! We were very disappointed at the paella and will definitely not come back to the restaurant again!",

Do not rest on your laurels because that way failure lies...I don't get to go to Radio Maria as often as I used to. It has a fond place in my heart, which is probably good for them as I'm not dinging them as much as I could in this review. RM was one of the first hip businesses that launched the downtown revival (along with The Blind Pig, v 1.0) and for that I have much love.The last few times we've gone, we've sat outside and had tapas. Now I'm no tapas expert, but I believe you usually order a bunch of tapas and they come out one-at-a-time to your table so you can experience each dish on its own merits.  RM, however, always sends out all the tapas all at the same time. Everything becomes a mish-mash and it's overwhelming and nothing stands out.  You also immediately get abandoned by the waitstaff so you have to wait forever to order another drink or get/pay your check. Also, the pretty pretty people who work there don't like kids. That would be fair if we were dragging the kids inside and interrupting the restaurant. But even if your kids are well-behaved and you're sitting outside, you catch a real snotty attitude. I am happy to report, however, that they do have a real highchair. When my eldest was a baby they had a beautiful vintage deathtrap highchair. They now have one that is still aesthetically pleasing, but without all the metal.The restaurant itself is still lovely. I just wish they'd shape up their staff so it wasn't so depressing to interact with them.",

It was. I ordered a Bell's HopSlam the next moment I saw the waitress, and it came only 5 minutes after I pained through the flat gin and tonic. When the tapas came 45 after my wife and I arrived, we enjoyed the mussel in miso broth special and bacon-wrapped rainbow trout with aoili. The Spanish tortilla was burnt. Luckily, the harissa helped cover up the carcinogens. Now, I wait for the waitress to return so I can ask for the bill and go to a bar with responsive service. At least it's beautiful outside.",

It's sort of criminal that its average rating isn't higher (particularly compared to duller visits like the unremarkable Esquire's and Applebeesian Destihl).While there may be little in Champaign to compare to bigger-city fine dining, Radio Maria (and Bacaro, to a more intimate extent) shoot pretty satisfyingly close to the mark. Radio's selection of beer and spirits is dizzying and its bartenders have been, in my experience, charming and skilled. Their tapas menu is a little uneven, but with that topography come some nice peaks.For sit-down dinners, there's a dining area and outside seating, both of which are quite nice. The dinner menu is small but far more evenly excellent. Their desserts are also wonderful. Other restaurants in the area with comparable pricing can't deliver meals this nice.And finally, go to Radio Maria for brunch. You'll spend about as much as you might at, say, \"Le Peep,\" but your meal will be ten times as good. Getting there at 10:30 on a weekend morning and sitting outside off North Walnut Street is a pleasure unique to Champaign, and it's one I'll miss when I'm gone.",

The patatas were just okay, but I'm pretty sure I burnt off all of my tastebuds when I tried them, so that may be why I can't give them a decent description. The cheesecake was delicious. I drank orange frescas, and did a lemon drop shot. It was very good- I was w. a group of about 10 people, and the service was speedy and friendly. Please please go here over Boltini- much less pretentious.",

Service was super slow and less than stellar: 2/5We arrived around 11:30 on a Sunday morning and were told we would have to wait 20-30 minutes since we hadn't made a reservation. Ok, fine that seemed reasonable enough and maybe would be a testament to the quality of the restaurant, I figured. Time easily killed by a walk around downtown. The hostess said that we could leave our phone number with them, and they would call us when it was our turn to be seated. A nice touch, I thought.We never received that phone call, but wandered back of our own accord some 15-20 minutes later, and our table was ready. We received menus promptly, and then spent the next fifteen minutes waiting for our waiter. When he finally showed up he did apologize for not coming by sooner, asked us if it was our first time there (yes, for myself and one other in my party), and then proceeded to describe Radio Maria's menu: the uniqueness of the Mexican inspired breakfast items, the deliciousness of the omelettes, etc. I think I would have really appreciated that primer if I had not already had the opportunity to read over the menu several times while we had been waiting for him to show up. He seemed really startled when we informed him we were actually ready to order, because clearly he was not ready to take them, citing the drinks he had to bring to another table. So cue another wait...All in all, we saw two tables that had been seated after us order food, receive their food, finish eating, and pay in the before we had gotten ours. Which points to less of a systemic problem (because, clearly, some patrons DO get their food in a timely manner), and maybe more of an individual issue. Our waiter did seem very harried, and I would venture to say even distressed, so maybe there is an issue with the division of work. I did notice that another employee stepped to help with water refills, but during only the last quarter of our meal.FOOD : We ordered: two veggie masa boats, vegetarian Eggs Benedict, Mexican coffees,and a side of beer bread.Rated from best to worst:Veggie masa boats (4.5/5): perfectly cooked eggs, and the masa black bean and tomato combo worked for me. What did not work: the goat cheese. I actually would have liked something a wee bit less salty and more melty, but I was in the minority at my table on this one.Vegetarian eggs Benedict (4/5): I guess I am used to versions with meat, but I could have done with a little more salt or other sort of seasoning. The slice of tomato/avocado combination didn't do anything for me.Beer bread (2/5): really dry and cakeyMexican coffee (1/5): Came with a half-inch of spice grounds at the bottom, and was cloyingly sweet (The upside to this is that a refill of regular coffee, added to the grounds, makes for an actually drinkable beverage).Overall... meh. I could overlook the service issues if the food were truly crave-worthy, but I did not find that to be the case.",

Their menu varies, but just tonight I tried a couple of tapas (fried mozzarella and calamari) and the mushroom ravioli. All were delicious and well presented.My warm chocolate cake dessert, however, tasted soggy and generally unpleasant. It came with a scoop of some oddly flavored ice cream---I think it was meant to be mint, but it tasted more like horseradish. Not the best way to end a dinner; fortunately the rest of the meal was good enough to make up for it.Our server tonight did a thoroughly wonderful job. But overall service in the restaurant felt slightly slow, even on this quiet Monday night when my party was one of only two or three in the entire restaurant for a whole two hours. Halfway through our meal I noticed a middle-aged woman abruptly exit the restaurant despite pleas from her waiter. There was no commotion: it appeared the customer left, after settling down but before ordering, simply to protest the service speed.If I had to nitpick, I'd add that the men's restroom was a little worn and unkempt in the details for a restaurant of this caliber. The lock was also broken. Holistically, though, I had a great dining experience here.Quick tip to first-time diners: Free parking is kitty-corner to the restaurant in a third-party lot. Spaces numbered 1 through 30 are reserved for this restaurant's patrons.",

Here goes:My fellow students and I had organized a fundraiser to be held at R.M. We were raffling off some of our artwork and had ordered a substantial amount of food because we were expecting 50+ guests. Around 8:30pm, there was an AWFUL stench that filled the bar area, followed by a watery mist that began to fall from the ceiling along the west wall of tables. There were a number of people sitting in this area (myself included), who were covered in this putrid water (I had to go home and shower!!!). The food we ordered which was on a nearby table, was also covered. I alerted the manager who said to me \"It must be our pipes again.\" Again? This has happened to other customers? The manager then called the fire department in to inspect the pipes running along the ceiling, while our guests (those who were left) crowded awkwardly around the bar.  The manager took no action in remedying the situation. Our food was NOT replaced, and the water on the tables and chairs was NOT wiped up, so that the guests could resume sitting. The artwork that was hanging on the wall was also damaged by the water, and was NOT compensated for. Radio Maria had quoted us for the cost of food prior to the event, but when we received our bill, it was over twice what they had quoted. Worse yet, the manager only refunded us the cost of one cheese plate. Thanks. You're swell.  This matter is still not resolved as the owners of Radio Maria seem to think they owe us nothing. I disagree, and until we receive just compensation, I will not be returning and hope you don't either.",

I took my family there for dinner during graduation weekend since I had just graduated from law school.I understand that graduation weekend in Chambana can be really crazy.  However, the service we got was unacceptable.  We ate dinner at a different restaurant in downtown Champaign the night earlier and did not have anywhere near the problems we had at Radio Maria.  Our water glasses were constantly empty, the waiter would go a half hour or more without stopping by our table, he would forget to do things we requested (i.e. fill our water glasses), etc.  The restaurant is also EXTREMELY noisy.Given the prices at the restaurant, we really expected better.  Further, although most of our food was pretty good, my grandparents could not eat the hanger steak they ordered to share.  My grandparents cannot do spicy food and the steak ended up being totally caked in a pepper crust.  The bottom of the menu says items on the menu contain ingredients that are not listed, but that is in very small letters and I didn't even notice it.  Apparently, my 90+ year old grandparents didn't notice it either.  My boyfriend tried the steak and said it was pretty spicy, so it seems strange that the fact that the meal is spicy isn't on the menu.My grandpa also got meat that was not good quality.  It was very tough and he said it was inedible.  The restaurant handled the problem graciously, however, and took the steak off the bill which we appreciated.Nevertheless, it is unlikely I would go back to Radio Maria or even recommend it to other people.  I will be here for several more months while I study for the bar and even though I always thought of this place as one of the nicer restaurants in town, I was really disappointed.  There are restaurants in Chambana that have great food for better prices.",

I don't feel like I can really do it justice by describing it, but you will not be disappointed if you order up a couple Absinthe drinks. 2) They offer \"The Wheel\", which is a 3.5 oz shot of each of their beers on tap. They have about 28 beers on tap, and many are the darker craft ales, which in addition to being really tasty, are higher in proof. You need a couple of people to do this right, and there are some \"rules\", but if you are already planning on cabbing it home, this is a great way to learn about beer and get drunked. 3) Their kitchen stays open all night. 'nuff said. 4) Radio is one of the very best places to sit outside on a nice summer night. Get a table at dusk, put your back to the window and watch the night unfold.",

We ordered a couple glasses of pinot noir and were happy with their selection. Our appetizer, the broiled goat cheese, was amazing. The grilled bread provided great texture to the meaty pumpkin seed and spice spread and the divine creaminess of the goat cheese. Our entrees were the two dinner specials for the evening, seared diver scallops and a filet. Our scallops were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The accompanying puree had pieces of bacon which perfectly complemented the entire dish. Our filet was a beautiful medium-rare piece of meat that just melted in my mouth. The bourbon demi glace and gratin brought the dish together into a very enjoyable experience. We tried two desserts, the molten chocolate cake and the green tea white chocolate mousse. I absolutely loved the mousse while my partner preferred the chocolate cake. The best part of the rich chocolate cake was the fresh mint ice cream that came with it. Overall it was an amazing dinner. Go to Radio Maria and order their dinner specials. You will not be disappointed.",

I love the old architecture and the period decorations. Yet, they have a modern touch also, so I guess you would call it eclectic. When you walk in, the bar is is front of you. It is large, and I would guess that it is very well attended. (Lots of people tried to get in but were turned away due to the party.) They had one of the largest liquor selections I've seen, and they even have infused liquors. I tried the maple-bacon burbon - good, but a little too sweet for my tastes. Their infused liquors are all made on premises. The bartender told me he did it himself - and for the party, he wore a kilt.The dining room is large. We had a limited menu with four choices and we all pre-ordered our meals. I have to say that the salad served before the dinner was really excellent, fresh, simple and just the right amount of dressing. I can't say as much for the meal - I had smoked ribs. They were pretty tough, but did have a good taste.They also have tables on the sidewalk which we took advantage of. Topping the night off by sitting outside, drinking bourbon, eating dessert, smoking a cigar and watching the people walk by ended the night with a flair.If I make it back to Champaign, Radio Maria is definitely on my go-to list.",

Tonight, we finally had dinner at the infamous Champaign culinary sensation.The food offering was a mish-mash of cuisines - South American, Asian, Mediterranean, Spanish - and seemed to lack a consistent and unifying theme/thread/philosophy. These types of menus are generally red flags for me because they say: I can do a breadth of styles good, but not one style great.We started off sharing the mezze plate. Pita was pizza dough-y, but buttery too...strange, in my opinion. Also, I found the couscous bland. Best part was the hummus, which I was wishing they served more of.For dinner I ordered the crabcakes, which were more like crabballs. Goat cheese potato pancakes were crisp, but lacked seasoning. Radio Maria's Haitian slaw was flavorless and served merely as decoration on my plate - I hate to say it, but KFC's got better slaw! Positives about the crabballs - they weren't THAT bad and you get three in an order. If you order this, ask for extra garlic aioli (probably best to ask for it on the side). I probably would've enjoyed my balls (but, really...who doesn't?!) more if I had extra aioli.Beau ordered the adobo pork. Generous hunk of pig, the orange-bourbon BBQ sauce starts sweet on the tongue, then finishes with a kick...flavor was decent, but I wasn't expecting or enjoying this sweet sweet meat (SHOCK, I know!). Jalapeno-cheddar cornbread was interesting in concept, but lacking in execution...I would've never known there was jalapeno unless the menu told me! Like the roughage on my plate, the honey left his chayote-cilantro salad be.Call me crazy, but I AM willing to try their brunch and/or tapas, but lemme check-in with not-my-bio-mama first...",

A couple items we ordered didn't exactly match the description on the menu... For example: the Eggplant Frites had no balsamic vinegar... Our artisanal cheeses were served with tiny hard pieces of pita bread, weird.When we received the \"warm bread it with butter\" tapa, we got the some boring and COLD pita bread that was served with the cheese. Beyond that, they gave us about 15x the amount of butter that could fit on the pita they served us. The waitress who served the tapas explained the types of butter, but after trying them we realized she didn't actually know what she was serving because she clearly described the wrong flavors. Back to the cold pita that was served... When the waitress finally returned, I asked if she could have the pita warmed, after all, the tapa is called \"warm\" bread and butter, right? When she brought the pita back, it had been deep fried.. WHAT? When we talked to the waitress about our disappointment she seemed flustered and then admit to us that she agreed it was weird to serve pita with the cheese but they were out of the crackers (we weren't even referring to the how weird it was to get pita with the cheese plate at this point) and then she continued to ask us if we wanted her to serve the bread that was supposed to come with the bread and butter... She then brought us out some cold, but real bread. Still not sure why this wasn't served in the first place...In summary:Service: Terrible Food: Pretty good, despite the fee makes that chef made Atmosphere: Very nice! You can choose to sit in a casual area or a dining roomPrices: Pretty expensive for the amount of food you're getting",

I chose the Dark and Stormy, which was ridiculously delicious with fresh ginger grated into it! (I ended up having another that I really didn't need, just because it was so refreshingly awesome.) Unfortunately Radio Maria's website seems to be down currently and it was about two weeks ago that I went here on a trip out to Des Moines so my memory has faded as to the specifics of what we had, but we ordered off the tapas menu and everything was above average. I'd definitely return here on a trip to the Twin City area.",

I am sorry to say I was a bit disappointed, in the food and the service.  I love the atmosphere there, however that can only entertain you so long, our food took at least and hour before it came out. We did have the baked brie for and appetizer which came out straight away, but then we waited, and waited, and waited for our main entree. Finally I think our server who at this point I was sure had vanished, came to our table and explained the delay. That was 45 minutes later mind you.  If he had told us initially that our meals would be slower coming out I would have been more understanding, however when you are starving and you see people who sat after you being served and getting their bill and you don't see your server anywhere, you start to wonder what's up.I would likely go back for the brunch, but may try dinner somewhere else, hence the 3 stars.",

For the most part, the food was good, but there were a couple clunkers. We ordered the a number of tapas, including arancini, pork belly arepa, diver scallops, crab tart, pork tacos, and beignets. The arancini were nicely done, if slightly overpowered by the breading. The pork belly arepa, however, was not made with pork belly and the diver scallops were not diver scallops. I believe the arepa was made with pork shoulder, and was good, but no one ever said anything about the change. Similarly, the scallops were very well done, but were not diver scallops. The crab tart, on the other hand, was a clunker, as were the beignets. The tart was made of corn bread and I don't know that I've ever had a more dried out piece of corn bread in my life. It totally overshadowed the crab. The beignets were huge, which meant they weren't cooked through. They were like eating a heavy cake doughnut, not the light crunchy wonder they should be. The best dish of the night was the tacos. Smoky, spicy, delicious. We will probably go back, but will be much more careful in selecting our dishes.",

Honestly, I don't really like most tapas restaurants, as I usually walk away from an expensive meal that leaves me hungry.  Not  the case at Radio.  They have a diverse menu, and pretty much everything is very good.  They technically have two kitchens, one traditional and one tapas (you can order from either or both).  Prices can be high for the prime dishes, but if that is not your thing, there are plenty of other options (tacos, tortas, etc.).The place itself is very cool.  I like downtown Champaign, and this is one of the nicer spaces.  The bar side has a modernist feel to it (blue lights under the bar, abstract art), while the dining area is a little more classic.  The bar is truly outstanding.  They probably have the best beer tap rotation in town (yes, that's right) and it's constantly changing.  Probably 25+ beers on tap, and good nightly drink specials.  This is usually one of my top late-night options for that reason, along with DJ Belly on the tables (old school hip-hop is usually on rotation after 10 pm). The food always pleases. My favorite is the paella, but they will put out a good beef tenderloin or other special on occasion that has always impressed.  The chef there is very talented, and the staff in general is very courteous.  If it gets crowded, you might be in for a long meal, but that doesn't really bother me much for this type of place.  We have done birthdays, graduation dinners, or stopped by at 1 am drunk as a night-cap.  It's a very versatile place that can appeal to a variety of tastes.  Definitely the most unique place in town, and should be at the top of anyone's Champaign restaurant lists.",

To start, the wine list was decent with selections from the west coast to Burgundy and Bordeaux, though they were slightly more marked up that I've been used to in Chicago.  However, the kitchen was very clearly overextended on the graduation Saturday.  While I don't fault them for that I must comment that it didn't seem like they had tried to shove extra tables into the restaurant so it shouldn't have taken 3 hours for dinner, especially since we ordered quite quickly after we were seated.As for the food, we started with the arancini and garlic shrimp skewers.  The arancini was satisfying though plain, and the shrimp skewers were well done.  The entrees were bold options that suffered only slightly from less than perfect execution and definitely warrant a return trip.  I enjoyed the pan roasted duck with goat cheese polenta and roasted beets, while my family selected their daily special (a salmon dish) or the hangar steak topped with bacon and a fried egg.  As I mentioned, the entrees were good enough to warrant a return trip.  Hopefully on my next trip to Chambana the kitchen will be less burdened and I'll be able to enjoy my meal at a slightly less leisurely pace.",

                "review": "Radio Maria was one of the first restaurants in the current resurgence of downtown.  When it opened around 1996, two upscale restaurants had come and gone in the Mike n' Molly's space, and other than Great Impasta, in its old location, there was nary a place to eat downtown except in bars/ short-order cafes.  RM made quite a splash, and I thought it pretty good the first several years.  Nice space, creative menu (for CU),  and some good servers.  Then things starting going south as more and more better-quality eating places opened downtown and elsewhere.  I feel they often try too hard with their entrees...too many conflicting influences and tastes.  I am all for fusion cuisine done well, but I think they lose the forest for the trees here a lot.  Now, the new tapas bar I like quite a bit.  Very reasonable, GREAT beer list, better service, and b/c of the nature of tapas, a more focused concept and execution of cuisine.  Both spaces are nice - they are adjacent to each other.",

The olives in our manchego baked olive dish had a bizarre citrus note that was rather offputting, and were way short on manchego.  Our apple blue cheese spread appeared to be apple-free, and the blue cheese spread itself was runny.  My bloody mary was top notch; I'll have to do some serious research to figure out whether it surpasses guido's for best bloody mary down town.",

Their brunch menu has options that can appeal to everyone from vegetarians to children. I went with the vegetarian masa boat surprise and found it to be very flavorful and well-prepared. The goat cheese in the dish was delicious!I would highly recommend making a reservation to shorten the wait time, as they always seem to be busy. Unfortunately, the service was still very slow after we were seated. No one came to take our order until we flagged down a waiter ourselves.  Overall, I'd say Radio Maria has a lovely atmosphere and great food. Even if it is crowded and the service is slow, I doubt you will leave disappointed.",

It looks beautiful before you start eating, at which time it turns into chaos. You eat your way down to the little masa boat that is stuffed with Mexican cheeses. A really thin omelet tops the boat, and it was so loaded with veggies and chorizo that you hardly notice that the eggs are there. That is perfect omelet in my opinion. The dish also included black beans, yummy potatoes, and salsa. All for only $8. My wife's fish tacos were great too, but not as good as we've had in other locales.",

It's not that there's anything outright bad here:  the dining rooms are nicely decorated, the service is okay, the food is well-prepared, the wine and beer selection is thorough but not amazing.  You probably won't be disappointed.But then there's nothing about this place that's outright great, either.Radio Maria was the first restaurant downtown, and they did a fabulous job.  But now the dinner menu hasn't changed in years, they got rid of a lot of their good lunch menu (in favor of tapas), and they've got this strange \"upscale comfort food\" menu on Sundays that doesn't seem to fit in very well.Even the service - which used to be their highest point - has been slipping.  As the old guard moves on, they're being replaced with awkward servers who don't know (and don't seem to care) about the food and drinks they're serving.I will, inevitably, go back.

I feel like either the town finally realized that it would be wise to start spiffing its image up a bit to attract more students' $$  by spending some $$ or else maybe in the last 8 years, CU's been adopted by a millionaire benefactor with desire to see a small town emulate a big bad city in its gastric offerings. The restaurant scene here has improved phenomenally. My boyfriend and I popped into Radio Maria after being turned away from Bacaro for not having a reservation on a Saturday night. We both had to giggle a little as that's never happened to either of us before in Chicago but it's good to get rejected every now and then. The waitress was apologetic and nice enough about it. So next door to Radio it was and I'm so glad we gave it a chance. We hadn't been in the mood for tapas until we opened the menu. Surprisingly innovative, interesting and very hip. We tried the smoked red potatoes with aioli, the fire roasted pears with manchego shavings and fennel, spanish fusilli pasta salad with olives (which I didn't want to fuss with at first b/c I hate spitting out seeds in public but they were pitted, nice touch) and spanish olive oil. I'm not a big dessert person but since I'd been enjoying the meal so much, I splurged and ordered the pumpkin cheesecake with cinnamon cream sauce. Still thinking about it a day later...the restaurant's decor was again surprisingly hip for Champaign. The bar is lit in blue from beneath and the artwork was very urban/Japanese. There was this cool light box banner thing running the length of the artfully splash-painted brick walls that I'd love to have in our house back in Chicago. Check it out if you're in town. The waitstaff and service was also very friendly, young and attentive.",

Taste-wise nothing to write home about, the bread is just so-so.  Marmalade added a nice kick to it though.Migas & Pulled Pork Eggs benedict - both were not too bad each came with a small side of their house potatoes.  The deep fried house potatoes were delish. Portions of the main entree were enough, but the side potatoes was on the lighter side, almost too little.  Service at 1:30 pm on a Sunday was a little slow - the place was fairly filled up, still, it seemed like they had a good number of servers, so this was a little disappointing.  Nice ambient, but can get very noisy.  Our overall rating of the restaurant is 2-star.",

An upscale restaurant in downtown Champaign, Radio Maria has both a well developed tapas bar with a metro, modern dcor as well as your classic restaurant dining area which is decorated in such a way that gives it a more rustic feel.My first experience here was a very pleasant one as we were promptly seated, the waitress was very attentive, and the food was done very well.  We started off with the broiled goat cheese as an appetizer which was very tasty, and then I got the grilled salmon as an entre.  Like everything else in Radio Maria, it was cooked well, plated beautifully, and served relatively promptly.I came here again several weeks later for brunch with some friends and had a craving for some spicy sausage so I got the house-made chorizo omelet.  To sum it all up: *drooool*.  My friend's said the same thing about their orders (Greek, Italian, and Pinta's omelet, and the egg sandwich).  Everything tasted fresh and light - just like breakfast should.Whether you're looking for a place to loosen your tie and grab a drink after work, out on a romantic date, or just hanging out with friends, Radio Maria is a sure bet for good food and a good time.",

I love to eat tapas in my hometown and was a little skeptical whether or not this place could live up to my LA expectations.  Radio Maria did not disappoint!First off, I loved the atmosphere.  The architecture and style of the place is so artistic and unique.  It's beautiful.  I love the artwork all over the walls and the bar area especially.  The dim lighting and the small bites menu definitely makes it a great place to go out with friends or to go on a date.  The drinks are reasonably priced and tasty too.I had the lamb meatballs, the bread with fig jam,  and the bread with serrano pork and orange marmalade and the potatoes.  I'm forgetting the name of each dish but they are on the tapas menu. Everything I ordered was great, but the potatoes were AMAZING!  They were crispy and had a delicious flavor because they were hickory smoked.  They also came with a delicate drizzle of the most delicious sauce, I wish I knew the ingredients so I could re-create this dish.  I can't wait to come back to have them again!",

We started off ordering a tapas as our appetizer...the apple salad. It was very disappointing. The apples were not cut to order and were not crisp even though it was stored in a container of lemon juice. The bacon was not reheated...I mean who likes cold bacon? For pur entrees we ordered the scallops and duck meatloaf. The scallops were good however I personally didnt appreciate the jam that went with it...could have done with a spicy savory sauce. The duck was unknowingly served with the same exact jam. It was a tad too sweet for our tastes, but regardless of that...the meatloaf was absolutely amazing. The egg that topped it however was a bit overcooked so the sunnyside up yolk could not be used as a sauce. Our final conclusion is that the main part of the entreeswere cooked to order, as they should be, but all the garnish was precooked and we got the feeling that it was just thrown on...not worth the price.",

We sat across a huge purple bar. The menu was much different than I remembered.  Instead of entrees like half chickens with grilled plantains, etc. they offered Tapas, which we didn't mind at all. In fact, we love Tapas. The best Tapas we ordered was the vegetarian paella. I wished the paella was served on a big platter like in Spain, but it was just in a tiny side dish, which I understand is part of the whole Tapas mentality, but still I wished they'd offer it on the menu as a main dish. The margarita I ordered was spot on. Not to strong, not to watered down. And their prices are extremely reasonable. We spent $47.00 without tip for six tapas, two margaritas, and one dessert, which we shared. I still love Radio Maria's, but I like the decor on the older side better.",

The mushrooms were bland -- the broth needs to be more flavorful. The bone marrow was also disappointing, the sauces on the plate did not complement the bone marrow at all. The crostini was very average, too much bread and oversized tomatoes for the amount of shrimp rendered.On the other hand, the stewed oxtail was absolutely delicious -- the meat was tender and the broth full of umami flavor. I was also a big fan of the lamb meatballs, perfectly done with a creative sauce to match. The potatoes were well seasoned and the dressing paired nicely. The mussels were served in generous proportion.Overall, 50/50 good bad. This was my second visit and I definitely trust Radio Maria for a night out dining.",

RM is situated in the bustling Downtown, and sports an eclectic modern decor with latin touches. The Tapas Lounge is all-modern, with changing exhibitions for wall-art, and a Euro-chic cleanliness, not typically found in the mid-west. I will talk of the awesome Tapas 'experience' at a later date, but this blog is devoted to our last night in The Dining Room.With an exceptional wine-list, dinner at RM always begins and ends well in terms of drinking options. One of the best things for me is that no matter what mood I am in financially, (from big-night-out, to my typical tuesday-night-budget) there are so many choices of great tasting vino. Although RM changes its menu about once a year, they (thankfully) keep many of their favorites available, such as the Coffee Filet, Peppercorn Tuna steak, New York Strip and appetizers Seared Avocado with Quinoa salad and Grilled Goats Cheese Medallions in pesto. All dishes have latin-fusion inspired flavors, plenty of warm chile, spicy cream, mole and guacamole sauces.Service at RM is impeccable. Quick, but tastefully so, timing is almost always perfect, polite and sophisticated. Their knowledgeable sommelier staff are very helpful for beginners and experienced wine-drinkers alike. Dinner is not cheap for the average mid-west dining clientele, but compared to similar dining rooms in larger cities, I think Radio Maria is worth double whatever the bill is.ALWAYS order the special, their young, fashionable chefs always deliver. Expect to spend $60-$80 on food for 3 courses for 2 people in the restaurant, or $40-$60 in the tapas lounge.",

Also, the wine selection is pretty decent.  BUT, I think the tapas side is just terrible.  We've only eaten in that part one time and I believe it was a Tuesday night, but essentially every dish we got had something wrong with it.  The biggest issue was that we were served the Spanish tortilla omelet refrigerator cold.  It is supposed to be GRILLED.  Not grilled then put in the fridge over the weekend!  We told our server and she told us that was how it was supposed to be.  Alrighty then!  Actually, every tapas we ordered was COLD, but this was the one that stood out the most (who wants cold eggs?  Not me!!).Maybe I need to experience the brunch to give a fair assessment, but for now I'm giving 2 stars (4 for the restaurant + 1 for tapas)/2 = 2 when rounding down).",

Amazing flavors, really great crab. Ordered a side of corn bread (drizzled with honey and orange marmalade), and that was pretty nice as well.

The hostess asks us how many, and are we here for drinks, tapas, or full meal?  I tell her tapas, and she tells us it's going to be 5-10 minutes, would we like to have a drink at the bar?  Sure, we walk past several empty tables and sit at the empty bar.  We are impressed with the blue light coming out from the bar top, when a \"bartender\" walks past and LITERALLY THROWS a drink menu onto the bar near us.  And keeps walking by.  I wasn't shocked because I had read the reviews, but I thought that was totally rude.I asked another guy walking by for a glass of water.  He was able to ablige, and by the time we got our water, amazingly the empty table behind us was available.  We sat, checked out a menu, ordered 3 tapas, and my friend ordered a beer and I ordered a glass of wine.  It took quite awhile for just the drinks to get delivered.  I was disappointed in the amount that they called a \"glass\" was about half of a glass I've gotten at other restaurants.  And when I was looking at the wine list, I asked for a recommendation, and said I didn't like fruity reds, I preferred more on the dry side.  I took a sip of an incredibly fruity red wine.  Sigh...When the food arrived, it was alright.  Maybe I just expect more.  It was okay food, just not as tasty as I've had elsewhere.  There were no outstanding flavors, or a bite of food that made me sit back and go \"wow.\"  Just ...average.The waitress asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu.  Sure, why not.  We went with the dark chocolate cake.  About 20 minutes later, we finally got the cake.  What took so long?  Who knows.  Maybe they had to bake the cake after we ordered it...  Anyway, I have NEVER left a piece of chocolate cake on a plate at a restaurant before.  My friend said the cake tasted like deli meat to her.  How does one make cake taste like deli meat?  I have no idea.  It tasted out right burnt to me.  Burnt cake peeled out of a pan, with some hersey's syrup on top to cover the taste.I ask for the check.  She came by with the check, I gave her my credit card, and away she went.  Another 15 minutes passed, and she had walked by our table about 5 times.  The next time she walked by, I asked her for the credit card receipt.  She was totally suprised, and hadn't realized she had never given it back to us.  She was sincere, it was just annoying.  I wasn't impressed with the food, and somewhat unhappy with the service.  There was dancing (salsa or something) starting as we were leaving, but I wasn't in the mood for it.  I don't know if I would recommend this place.  Maybe once just to go...  but I think once is enough.",

                "review": "Our whole family loves Spanish food and since we were all in Champaign for the football game we decided to check out a \"new to us\" Tapas restaurant.When we arrived at 2:45, the kitchen was not open but would reopen in 15 minutes.  We decided we could easily wait so we snagged two tables outside and ordered drinks.  The waiter delivered the drinks and took our tapas order so he could put in the order as soon as the kitchen opened which was a marvelous idea!  Before you knew it we were sipping on Sangria and our food began to arrive.We tried the cheese plate which was outstanding.  I could have just eaten that and been happy.  The mussels were grilled which had a pleasant taste but the grilling did dry them out.  The biggest disappointment was the Spanish tortilla, the traditional egg and potato omelet of Spain.  This had been prepared like more of a quiche and no one at the table liked or ate it.  I adored the fantastic lamb meatballs, we even ate the sauce with some of the bread which came with the cheese plate.  The other tapa I tried were the marinated olives which were not nearly as good as I had expected.  The marinade was so vinegary, not a smooth flavor at all.  I would not order that again.  We shared everything but there were some dishes I didn't try as I had ordered paella for my entree.The paella was really really good.  It had a spicy chorizo but it did not overpower the overall rich saffron/olive oil taste of the dish.  The rice part was outstanding and the chicken and seafood were generous and tender. What a treat!  I had partaken of too many tapas so my husband had to finish mine, now that is a generous portion.We had a great meal, my sangria mellowed me out after like 4 sips, the Illini had won and the weather was beautiful.  When the sizable check arrived I might have blanched at bit under normal circumstances but my husband and I just laughed and put it on a credit card.It was a great meal with the family but very expensive.   Next game, those kids are getting pizza or burgers!   Ol!",

We had several tapas and one appetizer, and the fried goat cheese was our favorite, so delicious and creamy, and it is served with a light jam that makes a wonderful combination.-The pork tacos were also delicious, and obviously slow cooked, very delicious.-The service was excellent, especially for how busy everything was (they were tripled booked for Valentine's).-The homemade ricotta gnudi were also delicious, especially with the sauteed mushrooms that accompanied it. -We also ordered a flight of ice cream that featured a mint chocolate cake flavor which was extremely aromatic, and smelled like I was walking through an herb garden, delicious. The Meh:-Personally, I was not a fan of the arancini, to me all I could taste was a fried greasy taste.Overall:-Would definitely return! Especially for date night, it's a fantastic place.",

The fusion menu doesn't work because the chef has not mastered the basic cuisines that they are trying to blend.  Dishes are overly complex and are either bland or actively taste bad.  The staff used to describe it as a Caribbean-Polish Fusion.  (Really.)  I have no idea what's going on now.  Spanish-Korean?  Soul Food Middle Eastern Style?  Masa boats. Frog legs. Ground coffee rubs. Pad Thai. Torta.   The motto seems to be:  when in doubt, add more things that don't go together, none of it done well.This could only be mistaken for sophistication by people who have never been anywhere sophisticated.

I was the only one that ordered for the four of us and our waiter just starred at us for awhile asking if we were sure that's all we wanted. You could tell he hadn't been working there long as he had to ask the kitchen twice about what was in some of the different sauces and I had to repeat my order twice so that he could remember it. I ordered the Wild Mushroom Crostini, Smoked Pork Tacos and Sauteed Calamari. My favorite was the Wild Mushroom Crostini. The mixture of the cheese, fried egg and mushrooms with the crunch of the bread made it delicious. The Sauteed Calamari was an interesting dish with a lot of flavor. It came out in a soup dish so it was great to dip just some of the bread in the sauce. The Pork Tacos were my least favorite as there was too much green onion for my liking.The food was good but each dish was made for two people rather than four. As we were finishing our plates, a waitress cleaned our table without asking if we were done, which peeved me because I wasn't done with the calamari.",

The menu options do change due to seasonal availability for veggies/fruit which means there is always something new to try!

They have put a great deal of thought into the atmosphere and aesthetic of the restaurant but not enough into what the customer wants to eat.  I have visited three times and each time I go I come away a little more disappointed.  The unique menu loses its appeal when the food is more satisfying to look at on the plate than it is to taste.  The ice cream sandwich dessert was perhaps the toughest dessert I have ever ordered at any restaurant.  Their one vegetarian friendly option was mac and cheese which gets tiresome to vegetarians.  With the volume of alternative diets being practiced, especially in a college town, I assumed a trendy place like this one would cater more to the non-traditional eater.  Their new twists on traditional food abandons the American-fare loving customer, as well as the non-traditionalists.",

A great, locally sourced, and seasonally rotating menu that has quite a bit of variety in terms of flavor as well as price. So if you're a cheapskate always looking to get the most for your money (like me =D) then you won't find Big Grove too bad. If you're also looking to empty your wallet they can accommodate that as well. The interior is hip, but not too hip, and I find the layout of the place pretty comfortable.The service here varies from day to day and depending on when you're dining, although I don't recall ever having a less than decent experience. Service staff is always very attentive and friendly and the food is always prepared well. They also have neat specials from time to time like half off house cocktails on Tuesdays! Overall a great place to go with a group or a date. Especially in the summer months when the patio is open!P.S. One of my favorite places for brunch in the area. If you don't care for the dinner selections you should definitely try the place Sat/Sun morning.",

The restaurant was basically empty, and I asked if we can instead push 2 regular tables in the bar area together so everyone in the party could talk with each other. They seemed annoyed and the manager made a point of saying she would check to make sure our server \"didn't mind.\" Did I mention the restaurant was empty? I would think  they would want customers and make them feel welcome. Afterwards when the bill came we asked why they didn't charge the advertised happy hour prices. The server said that's only if you sit AT the bar. We sat at tables. Wow. Bottom line: This is not a customer-focused place.",

Because of the local aspect of the ingredients, expect to pay $2-3 more than you would at a local chain, but the improved atmosphere and deliciousness definitely make it worth it!",

The only difference is that Big Grove Tavern is good.I really hate hipsters. Like, some of the stuff that comes out of their mouths actually angers me. So I was not too eager to come to this place thats all \"local, farm to table, blah blah blah.\" Because a lot of times thats a hipster excuse for mediocre tasting food. I dont care if its local or organic or any of that. I just want it to be tasty!! When we walked in I was like... here we go. The OC soundtrack is playing, the menu comes on little clipboards with the farms listed on it, and there is no salt or pepper shakers on any of the tables. It seemed pretentious to me. But for the most part, everything I tried here was tasty.We had the fried cheesy grits, french fries with malt vinegar aioli, and pickled veggies for an appetizer. I didn't try the vegetables because pickled stuff is not for me. The other two passed the test.For dinner, I ordered the macaroni and cheese. In retrospect I wish I would have ordered the vegetarian version because there was so much bacon in this that it actually took away from the goodness of the cheese. But +1 for it being piping hot.The rest of the family had a pork tenderloin, beef short rib, and burger. I tasted the short rib and the burger- the rib was a little salty but still good. The burger was flavorful but for me (and this is just a personal preference) the mixture of meats made it a little too soft.We did have dessert- Gooey butter cake and a chocolate pot-de-creme. The butter cake fell a little short. I was expecting it to be warm and gooey. It was cold, not gooey, but still rich. The pot-de-creme, was... *kisses fingers like an italian chef* Perfectly bittersweet, rich rich rich, and topped with vanilla whipped cream that I could see the little vanilla speckles in. Nom.Our server was really cool and seemed to genuinely enjoy his job. He kept referring to the chef as \"chef,\" like \"chef makes this, and chef did that\" which was kind of irksome, just because its like... you're in Champaign IL, chef. Come back down to earth a little.",

It's a blend of beef, bison & pork, you can add cheese, and it has an aioli on top.  I've tried it bunless, and the meal is equally as satisfying sans bun bc the meat is so juicy and flavorful!Each time you dine in, you get a little tin of complimentary seasoned popcorn of the day.  Nice touch.  Another nice touch is the olive oil drizzle you can request on the vanilla ice cream for dessert!On my latest visit, I wandered in at brunch time and tried the chilaquiles.  Based on my previous dinners here, I had high hopes for the dish, but my heart sank with my first bite, as the pulled chicken was cold.  I was able to find a few pieces that were lukewarm, but that was disappointing.  The two poached eggs were bordering on cold too, so they had obviously been poached earlier.  Atleast the tortilla chips were crunchy...  I also appreciated the fresh cup of decaf brought to me mid-meal, since the kitchen had just brewed a fresh pot.  I would've enjoyed a meal as hot as that coffee!Last notes: I liked the strings of lights hanging from the ceiling, ornaments hanging by the bar, and snowflakes drawn in the window.  Very festive!  Music playing was right up my alley too, so I enjoyed the ambiance.",

I got the burger and it was real good - they forgot to put the egg on it like i ordered but brought me out an egg minutes later.  the drinks were really good too - had a bullet old fahioned.

The welcome snack is a daily-fresh made popcorn with a rotating seasoning.  Ours was crazy good, but we had to ask the server to place the flavor:  cumin & orange zest!  Apparently the chef regularly changes it.The tap and bottle list is craft beer lover's friend. Not trying to outdo a number-of-taps contest, but all the right choices were there. Especially loved the slightly sarcastic \"These Beers?\" bottom of section of the menu for those who want a Bud Light instead.Tater tots are like nothing you've seen: homemade and tasty with an apple sauce. The smoked bacon practically jumped off the deviled eggs.The menu feels relatively small when you're used to the pages and pages on your typical chain.  And I wouldn't mind if they expanded it a bit, but there were so many good looking items, I think it will take several visits without any boredom. That most of the ingredients are locally bought makes it worth it.Service was exactly what you expect from a place like this: a whole step above any chain restaurant. Constant attention, knowledgeable about the food, funny and warm, but never over-intrusive. Perfect!Nice job, Big Grove Tavern.  We'll be back.",

This is the third time I've eaten here, so I feel qualified at this point to pass judgement. My impressions so far:The food is great...although the dinner portions tend to weigh in on the \"smaller\" side.  I had the filet, and what it lacked in size it made up for in taste. It was well cooked and tasted excellent. However, the side that came with it (a mixture of small carrots and potatoes) left something to be desired. This isn't a place you'll go for dinner and take home any leftovers.  The Risotto also tasted great, and while it also wasn't a huge portion, it seemed to be enough to suffice.  The prices were also fairly reasonable for a medium-to-upper scale restaurant, except for the $8 cocktail which seemed on the skimpy side, size-wise.Two other standouts at this place for me are the deviled eggs appetizers ($1 a piece, and delicious!) and the Tavern Burger, which is a mixture of beef, pork, and bison and is the reason I will keep going back.  For my money, it's one of the best burgers in town.",

Service was wonderful, and there was an understated elegance and relaxation in the staff and the atmosphere.Tiny smelt breaded and fried with lemon mayo were a hit; the wonderfully seasoned pork-belly with grits melted like chocolate as it entered my mouth.  However, the special pork shank and beans seemed a bit of a miss, and the mac and cheese, although quite tasty, was so large and rich and hot that it was difficult to enjoy-maybe it could be a small appetizer, side?  The chef at Big Grove definitely puts out quality, tasty food that re-imagines the standard Midwestern menu.  I applaud that. However, some of the details were slightly troubling: out of draw item (burger) at 7:00 PM; slight gaffe on menu 'These beers?'; one dish that didn't quite work.3.5",

I tried to take a couple bites, but dang, it was good!  I would have ordered another but our food came pretty quickly after.  Deviled egg doggy bag anyone... or just me?I had the turkey sandwich, which had so much flavor for a turkey sandwich!  Loved the bread, the cheese, the spreads.  Also ordered at our table was the Tavern Burger (which looked like a big, juicy meatball) and the chicken sandwich.Their menu looks different now, which means rotating sandwich toppings and mains = never gets boring.  Their salads, bar snacks and starters all look amazing this time around too.I plan to make this a regular lunch spot when I'm in the area.  Maybe dinner too, so I can try one of their fun sounding cocktails!",

The staff was excellent - friendly, helpful with menu selections, and accommodating. The menu itself is charming - and the attention to the farm-to-table detail is commendable. There's seasoned popcorn on the table - a nice touch. I tried the very economical \"If It's From The Vine It's Fine\" daily wine special, which was quite a brilliant surprise for the price. I would recommend this to anyone. The take on a wedge salad - using bibb lettuce - was inspired. I was surprised there was no bread served with the salad. And, while I realize this is the chef's preference, I wanted some to sop up a little of the salad's very tasty creamy herb vinaigrette. And so I asked for some bread. And received some lovely bread to accompany the salad. For a main I ordered the Tavern Burger - a monster of beef, bison & pork, red onion marmalade, cornichon aioli - and served with house-cut fries. The fries were great! A bit less greasy version of those fantastic greasy kind of fries you get from a hot dog stand. Super good. As was the burger - the marmalade - and the cornichon aioli. Everything was perfect except...the bun! - Which was so bland and tough and flavorless, I tossed it to the side and knife and forked the burger.I'm sure, if I brought this detail to the staffs attention, they would have somehow taken care of things - they were nice that way. So I can only fault myself for not making an issue of it then. But man - compared to everything else - that was so great - that bun was a letdown. Regardless, I highly recommend Big Grove Tavern.",

The second time I went I met a friend and we sat at the bar. The bartender was inattentive and did not get me a water when I asked the first time. He kept walking away before I got a chance to finish ordering everything and he didn't smile once. When I finally got my food, my medium burger was almost well done, the lettuce on the burger was so soggy it dripped off my burger, and the fries were so salty that they made my stomach hurt. I couldn't finish my burger or the fries and it was extremely overpriced. I would not recommend this restaurant unless you just go for drinks or the eggplant sandwich. You will pay too much and get less than mediocre, almost inedible food.",

It made it very springy and slightly rubbery. The fries that came with it saved the dish. I don't like how they are so short and you have to use a fork but the seasoning and the texture was as perfect as fries can get. 4/5",

The food overall was bland.  We had the chili which was the best of what we ordered, the corn bread that came with it however, well, anyone could make something better tasting from a box mix.  The portabella mushroom sandwich was okay,  most of the flavor came from the butter, not sure what the cheese really was...., and the sweet potatoe chips again, we're okay.   Then came dessert. I am a sweet tooth fanatic, and I have very rarely not eaten a dessert, especially if it is chocolate based. The chocolate bread pudding looked chocolate, but had no chocolate, no sweetness, literally, no taste to it .  I kid you not. Not sure how that happens, but they seemed to master it here.  I see this place has really good reviews for dinner, so maybe it is just their Sunday brunch, but will probably not attempt to go back given the many other wonderful resturants in the area.",

Not to mention lots of very good beer bars.  This place tries to combine the two with a small but well constructed tap list and a small locally sourced menu.  My parents have been here a few times, and warned me of the downfalls (slow service, running out of menu items).  Well, I always have to check a new place out and see for myself.  After our visit, I had to apologize and thank them for humoring me.Anyway, a large open room with an island bar.  The light fixtures look like Christmas lights bought at Farm & Fleet.  The sticks on the ceiling look like they were bought at Hobby Lobby.We were seated right away, which was a good sign.  Though besides the fancy popcorn we were ignored for a long time.  I hate to be the person to say service was slow, cause it was a busy night.  I can deal with slow, but no acknowledgement what so ever was not good.  Incredibly slow kitchen times as well.We finally put our drink and food orders in at the same time.  We were not sure when we would get another chance.  I liked their beer selection.  8 taps of good micros.  Though they were out of four taps.  Half of their selection was out.  I like it when a place can go through kegs and rotate the selection, though no.  They would rather just not have half the selection.  Out of Great Lakes, out of Founders, out of Dark Horse, out of Victory.  I ended up with a Sculpin, and my Dad a Goose Island 312.  If you are going to have a small selection, you need to keep it stocked.The menu was similarly small, but looked good.  My Dad ended up with the last burger, which is a mix of beef, bison, and pork.  Sounds great.  He has tried to eat here before, twice actually.  Both times out of the burger, so it was good that he finally got to try it.   Again, it is good that they can go through the menu like that.  Though it is tiring when they keep running out.  I had the pork sausage, my Mom Mac & Cheese.  It is a tiny menu for dinner, about 5 main courses.  I love when a place can do that.  Just not enough here to pull that off.  Especially when they run out of stuff. On top of that, not much here was that great.  The burger was decent, Mac & Cheese cold, and the sausage was poorly executed with little flavor.  They shout from every corner that everything is fresh and local.  Fine, but make it good.This is one of my longest reviews, and I guess it is this way because I had very high hopes and little was as expected.  Though I was told before hand that everything was slow, over priced, pretentious, not that good, and often out.  This place just left me wanting so much more.",

I was pleasantly surprised how great the whole experience was.On Monday night they had a nice pre fixe menu for $50 with shared appetizer, soup/salad, entree, and shared dessert. Otherwise I could see dinner getting pricey here fast. We started with the Brussels sprouts which were lightly fried and not as oily as most fried sprouts. I could eat these all day.We tried a couple of deviled eggs and they fact that you can order them one apiece for $1 is nice if you just want a taste. Pretty standard, but tasty as most deviled eggs (to me) usually are. The cauliflower soup was nice as well. A bit plainer tasting than butternut squash soup, but I would still order it again with some toasted almonds. The steak entree was cooked perfectly though they never asked how I wanted it cooked. Glad they read my mind and got the medium rare cook correct. Root veggies were good too.I wasn't in love with the rice pudding, though it's not usually my thing. I didn't think it actually had rice in it...Though I don't get to Champaign too often, I would easily recommend it for someone looking for a good farm to table restaurant. Especially Mondays!",

The meat was highly overcooked, tough and chewy despite ordering it medium rare. My friend had a risotto, which just looked like mush on the plate. Both of our food came lukewarm. It was a quite busy night Im guessing, and the food sat out waiting to be taken - but any proper restaurant would manage better.When I went for lunch I had a steak sandwich - again with the toughness of the meat and a slightly stale bread this time, by the time I finished eating my jaw was sore, as if it had done some bench pressing.I'm giving 2 stars because of their poutine available on Friday and Saturday evenings after 9pm. It makes for amazing post-bars food, maybe since you are not really caring about quality as much....",

The flavours to everything from the Appetizers to the Main Courses to the Dessert continue to impress.  I have too many favorites to enumerate, but I'd recommend Big Grove Tavern to anyone who loves food.  All local, always fresh.  The Tuesday fried chicken & waffles are amazing.  I have only tried the brunch once, but it was delicious and my whole family had a great time.  Loved the bloody mary's too.  The staff are incredible, possibly the best in town.  The servers know what they are doing and they do with elan, charm and a ready smile.  And everyone cares so deeply that the guests are having a great time.Lastly, I have been hanging out at Big Grove's beautiful bar (and I have learned that even the bar is \"local\" made by a local artisan) and it is becoming a truly cool after work watering hole.One word of advice, if you are planning on a Friday or Saturday dinner visit, you probably would be wise to make a reservation(which I did from their website via Opentable.com).  Easy to do. Try it.  You'll love it too.",

He said the chef runs every everything and she has complete say.  I asked who he reports to and he couldn't say.  I asked for the owners contact info, either email, phone or snail mail, and was given three names as-if I'm supposed to look them up myself when I was merely trying to do them a favor by letting them know how ridiculous this was.  I think I'll do myself a favor by not dining here again.",

I got the succotash, which was nicely presented and the flavors were great. It was a pretty small dish, but I was warned. My friend got the chicken which was also really well put together and tasted great. While we were there, a Spanish mariachi band stopped by and played and that also really added to the fun atmosphere. The place was not overcrowded so it was really enjoyable to sit there for a while. The reason for the 4 stars is just based on the waitress we had, but the food was good and I would eat there again.",

The popcorn presented when we arrived was nicely flavored with spices, but came in a rather small tin.  We began with two cocktails which were delicious, but for the area, were either too small, or overpriced.  Thus began the battle of the perceptions in regards to overpriced versus tiny portions.We did not have appetizers because in my mind, they were a little pricey.  Deviled eggs for $1.00 each?  Ok, I get it, these are local eggs.  But half of an egg with a little mayo and some flavoring mixed into the yolk for $1.00?  Nope, still expensive.  Fries for $4.00?  Nope, not for this guy.  Besides, Illinois isn't know for their potato harvests.  $9.00 for a mixed greens salad?  How about make that salad plural and give us a couple of them for that price?Moving on, I wanted to try the famous \"Tavern Burger.\"  However, at 7:45 p.m., in a restaurant which wasn't packed out, they were out for the evening.  Really?  Hmmm, how strange.  You mean the cheapest choice for dinner, the one item which was mentioned in the newspaper and was considered your house specialty, and, worth mentioning again, your CHEAPEST dinner choice, was out so early?  How very strange...  I guess that meant I would have to choose a more expensive option. (And, incidentally, our server told us you made it fresh every day.  So, why didn't you just whip up a little more of the mix?  Or, does the bison truck come very morning?)We chose the Trout and the Pork Loin.  First, the portion sizes were tiny.  For the price of the trout, we expected at least half of a small trout for $18.00.  What we got was about 1/3 to  1/2 of a side of a small trout.   As for the pork, we received what amounted to about a 3 oz. portion.  Now, I understand it's local.  But, and I'm saying this as a consumer and a cook, pork is not expensive.  There is no grocery store in Champaign where you can go and find any cut of pork out pricing Beef.   And, the accompaniments, the turnips, chicory and cornbread were nice, tasty and well presented, were cool and not substantial.  The pork, for the price, should have been at least twice the size, and even this would have made the price extravagant.We shared a bottle of white wine from the menu, the wine selection being very good by the way, and also had dessert.  I had the Ice Cream Sandwich (which should have been slightly warmed so as to not have been served rock hard), and my guest had the Pot de Crme.  Both were delicious!Overall, I believe our bill totaled more than $140.00.  Can you believe it?  $140.00 for two cocktails, one bottle of white wine which retailed for about $13.00, two main dishes and two desserts.   Fine for Haute Cuisine, not fine for a tavern. We found the service to be just about perfect, as our server was attentive and respectful of both our needs and our privacy.The atmosphere is great in this place.  The food is good, but not great.  With the expanding options in the area, especially the great options across the street, there is little to nothing to draw me back to this establishment.",

                "review": "We went for an early Saturday night dinner, drawn in by new fine dining in the area (which is limited) and the promise of local farm to table style. We are huge fans of many local farm efforts, which can be sampled at the Common Ground Co-op and the Market at the Square on Saturdays at Lincoln Square Mall -- and now, Big Grove Tavern.First, the food, from a foodie perspective: Fresh product, well selected and well cared for. The flavors of the natural food are highlighted. The preparation is often minimally invasive. The technique is classic French. The flavor profile is quiet. My partner and I both wished for something a touch bolder. For example, the deviled eggs, a pre-starter, have yolks mixed with peas. We would suggest adding an acid note, perhaps a pickle. It was nice that they brought out flavored popcorn as a freebie with our drinks -- a feature at BGT. The flavor of the night was white truffle oil -- and you could taste the oil. That was a real win.For starters, my partner had the chili and cornbread, and I had the chicken liver pate with pickled onions and stewed rhubarb. I think mine was better -- really delicious, with rich, deeply flavorful pate contrasted against the rhubarb, which gave the bite the sweet and sour it needed to cut through. The farmstyle, whole grain bread had a wonderful crunch. The cornbread was a bit too refined -- it needed  more crust and less cake, more corn flavor and less cafe baked-good sweetness. The chili was savory, but mild--no real taste of chilis.The entree and dessert courses were both very good, especially dessert. My partner had the short ribs, which were beautifully medium rare -- not a hint over or under. I had the roast chicken with dumplings, which was amazingly good. Crisp skin, moist and flavorful meat, with a delicious herb broth under. Three dumplings that tasted like a delicate stuffing and had a satisfying bite. Slices of asparagus that also had a nice bite and a lovely green flavor still -- not at all cooked out. The portions seemed just right -- not too much and not too little.For dessert, my partner had the rhubarb crisp and i had the chocolate pot de creme. Both were really superb: refined, flavorful, rich, balanced. Nothing fussy -- just satisfaction in every bite, with very good coffee on the side (they use a medium blend from the Columbia Street Roastery -- a fine choice).The food is not bold. Or experimental. Or imaginative. But it is good, very good -- much better, I thought, in terms of technique than Carmon's Bistro.It's clear from the limited but well selected menu that the chef behind it is attempting to appeal to middlebrow Midwestern tastes, but doing it in such a quality way that I found it kind rather than condescending. People who don't necessarily like a chi-chi dining experience will enjoy the food, and those who do like fine dining will think it is predictable in its selections but well done nonetheless.Second, the decor and atmosphere: I generally like the blend of industrial and contemporary tavern that the interior designer seems to have been going for, although the dark colors dominate a little too much, despite the effort to add bits of fun in the lighting options. BGT has a chic, young vibe -- somewhere between casual and serious. Dark gray walls with a black drop tile ceiling, black wire-cage pendant lamps with industrial bulbs of different shapes (reminds me of the recent Restoration Hardware line), bleached branch chandeliers over the bar area, outdoor party-lights with clear exposed globe bulbs interlaced with raw blond planks (one off note: the planks have lumber-yard stamps, which may be a bit too low-end for what they were going for),  fairly inexpensive light-wood grain tables and nicely selected dark chairs--if a bit flimsy--and booth upholstery. I hope that over time BGT will invest in some better art pieces, and ones that bring more interest and warmth to the interior. There's seating outside too, if you're a smoker or don't mind getting it second hand.Third, cost: Yes, yes, it's on the expensive side. BGT is fine dining, not family dining. I won't be eating here every night either. Of course, any diner can make the meal more affordable by just sticking with an entree, rather than getting the whole shebang -- I'd guess for dinner that this would run you $20-25 tops. But if you have a deeper pocket that night, the whole shebang here could run you $100 with tip for two -- and you still won't feel cheated. The value is here, given the quality of experience.Fourth, service: BGT has a young, eager service staff. They took good care of us, and every other table I could see. From beginning to end, we enjoyed our time here.",

We went on a Monday and did the date night menu which I have enjoyed before. My boyfriend got the grits with pickled vegetables and said they were amazing. I got the pate and I could have eaten that everyday and not gotten sick of it, so good. I got the risotto and he got the filet, both equally tasty. His parents said their meals were great too. There was also a nice beer selection to choose from. The only problem I've ever had there was one of their mixed drinks tasted very funny to me. Overall, the food outweighs that though.",

I came in with a group of friends for lunch one day, and while the service was nice, the environment fine, the food was just completely underwhelming.I ordered the burger for lunch, with a side salad.  The burger was incredibly difficult to eat, and not due to excessive size, or the usual suspects.  I added an egg for 1.50, which turned out to be a mistake.  Although the flavors were OK, the bun just wasn't able to hand and got soggy, the burger decomposing as I ate it.  The proportions were off, and the lack of spectacular taste just made the meal messy with no upside.  The lettuce was completely wilted under the burger and the onions were entirely too sweet.Similarly, the salad was unfortunate.  Too much dressing and an overly generous hand of salt and citrus made the salad too salty and sour.For the entire meal, I paid $17 including tax and tip, which is OK for a downtown area.  However, I'd suggest that you check one of the other places around if you're looking for a solid burger.",

There are a lot of interesting dishes on the menu and everything we tried was good.I recommend the fried cheesy grits- really good.

Both were very tasty, and had that been my only experience with Big Grove I would probably have given it a four or five star rating.  Unfortunately, I went there for lunch and had the chicken salad sandwich. I wish I had read the other reviews about it before I ordered.  The chicken salad was absolutely flavorless, and there wasn't much of it. The bread was dry and tasteless. Moreover, the dish cost $9.00.  I hope the owners are reading these reviews, because the chicken salad sandwich is consistently getting bad reviews, and needs to be revamped or taken off the menu altogether.",

The burger was alright; I always feel a bit jipped when a restaurant burger doesn't include tomatoes in it.

So to me, it seemed like the chicken;pork was more of a \"side\" than the main highlight of the dish. Overall, the flavors were really nice, but it wasn't anything terribly special.I would give this a 3.5.

When she would come over she wouldn't say more than 2 words to us and would leave as soon as possible. If we dared to ask her for anything she would just storm off and eventually come back with more water or popcorn since that is all we ever asked her to do. To top it all off, when we finished paying we were still talking and she came and got out receipt slips and read the tip amount! Of course she wasn't too happy since we tipped low based on how awful she was! But her doing that definitely justified to me why we tipped her low, that's for sure!Only reason I give 2 stars is because I liked the food.

Our server was really sweet and gave her opinion if we needed her help. I can't quite remember what I had because it was the special, but i thought it was delicious. It was two fried tortillas with black beans, rice, and salsa verde. It was topped with 2 fried eggs. Big Grove Tavern is not a place where you go just to \"have lunch\". It is a  place where you know you will get a good meal while feeling good about yourself because local farmers' produce is used in all steps of production.",

The menu looked very unique, flavorful and fun. However, none of the dishes blew me or my friends away. Everything was good and I appreciate how fresh the food was, but it all needed a little something more. The deviled eggs were awesome and so fun to order one at a time.

When we asked the bartender questions about the menu, he responded with an indifferent \"I don't usually work brunch\"...alrighty.  The food was delicious, but bordered on cold by the time it arrived. Bartender seemed to be tinkering around with menial tasks to avoid contact with customers.  After asking for the bill and producing a card, he walked away, forcing us to leave cash in order to get to the game.  It's gameday in Champaign, and we were decked out in Illini apparel...generally, servers know there's a game and will do their best to get you going.  I think in the future we will stick with Destihl, where service is always top-notch.",

                "review": "On Wednesday, July 11th a group of seven of us went for dinner. After a week of oppressive heat we were happy to be able to enjoy the weather and sit outside. It was great. We started with the tater tots and deviled eggs for appetizers. I loved the tater tots. They're not your typical frozen tots. They had some kind of apple puree sauce on the plate. Initially, I was skeptical, potato and apple together? It was delicious though. Holy cow. I really enjoyed that. I wish more than 4 came in an order though. The deviled eggs were nice, also. I really got a lot of the sweet pea flavor. It sounds odd but it was great and added a freshness to the egg. For dinner, several of us got the burger. Ohhhh my gosh. It was great. Cooked to the perfect temperature. It was a combo of bison, pork, and beef. The red onion marmalade on top was awesome. It added a sweetness and a lot of great flavor. A couple other people had the fried egg on top and they enjoyed it. The bun wasn't store bought and tasted homemade, very similar to what my husband bakes. It was nice to have a bun that doesn't disintegrate. The hand cut fries that came with the burger were the best fries I have had in years. Another friend INHALED the white fish. I didn't taste it but he said it was great. Someone else got the pork belly and kohlrabi gratin. She said it was great and was really happy with her choice. I wish I hadn't been at the opposite end of the table so I could have stolen a bite. It looked good. For a cocktail I had the Tavern Infusion. It was great and refreshing. There was a good selection of beer and wine, too. I stuck with one cocktail and water though. It was a nice touch when the owner came around to the tables and said hi and checked on us and other tables. She seemed really nice. Everyone at our table enjoyed the meal. We will definitely be back again, hopefully sooner than later.",

                "review": "I have a generally favorable view of this place. Like others before me have said, I definitely appreciate their fresh, simple approach that values quality ingredients and careful preparation.Several things hold me back from a full-throated endorsement, however.  First, the prices are steep.  The one reasonably priced entree item- the burger- frequently runs out.  I'm not sure if I just hit this place at the wrong time over and over, but I've only ordered it successfully once.  They know the demand is there, so why not have more? I understand that they don't want to freeze it, or whatever, but I've hit that place at 7 o'clock, and they're out of hamburgers.  It becomes apparent pretty quickly why there's no rush to increase their supply- because every other entree costs 5 dollars more. Secondly, the other (non-burger) entrees are small.  I rarely finish my plate at ANY restaurant, but here, it's no contest; I finish it all.  Last time, I ordered the mushroom risotto.  It was AMAZING.  I loved it!  But the size of it seemed like little more than a side dish.  My S.O. and I looked at each other at the end of the meal with our empty plates between us and I could tell we were thinking the same thing - I'm still so hungry!  Afterwards, we ended up going to Merry-Ann's around the corner for chili cheese fries (our adventure at that establishment is detailed in another review).Finally, service is hit or miss.  Last time, my S.O. ordered the special.  The server said that she wasn't sure they still had the special, so he went ahead and ordered a back-up entree in case (this was his idea, not hers).  She never came back to tell us what result.  The runner came out with our food, and of course, it was not the special, but the backup.  She was busy, but it would have been nice if she had just swung by and told us that they were indeed out of the special.  I think she might have been new, because her server-patter was also wanting. (She really didn't know what to say to us when she first approached the table.)  She also forgot my Patio Pounder (a great cocktail, BTW) until I reminded her, and I only got it once I was almost done with my entree.  I had water, so it was no big deal, but the overall experience (coupled with the bill at the end) quashed the overall good vibe of the place.Before I move, I do think I will go back and give it another shot.  Their date night menu looks like a good deal, and I'm really rooting for this place to be all it can be.",

I would have given this place 4 stars if not for the service, which has been some of the worst I have received in Champaign-Urbana.  More on this shortly.I love select dishes on the menu, but I feel like you have to know what to order.  The burgers are INCREDIBLE.  I never want to eat another burger that is not a mix of beef, bison, and pork.  Awesome.  And the fries with it are great!As much as I enjoy the burgers, there are times that you want some variety.  I know that it is trendy to include deviled eggs on a menu, but this are nothing special.  However, I feel like the pretzel makes up for this.  The pretzel is great and if you like your mustard with a HEAVY amount of spicy horseradish, this is for you!  I also really enjoyed the pork belly, but wish it was larger than just a starter.All of that being said, all of my recent experiences there have been a service disaster!  We have enjoyed going for the Friday outdoor concert series because we can sit outside and enjoy dinner, a beer, and the music.  In fact, until the service problems began we would go every week religiously.  Earlier in the summer the service was not a problem.  However, the past several times we have gone, we have literally had to BEG to be waited upon.  Each of these times, we have arrived, been seated, and then waited for 20-30 minutes before any server came to our table to even take a drink order.  We have had to ask the hostess or manager, some times several times in the same meal, to have one of the wait staff come to our table just to take an order.  The last straw was when the same friend was there for TWO DIFFERENT MEALS IN A ROW (seated at an entirely different table) and she too was talking with the management to try and get someone to take our order.The paranoid person in me worries that this lack of service is because we came with a small child.  Our child is quite well-behaved in a restaurant, but we try to be courteous and go for very early dinners when we know she will not be a problem.  We always try to order the full meal (drinks, dinner, dessert) up front and ask that the bill be given to us when the drinks arrive so we can make a quick get-away if necessary.  My point is that this is the one time that we actually get to go out and enjoy an adult meal and activity and I don't want it regularly spoiled by bad (or nonexistent) service, regardless of whether or not it is because I have a child with me.  I have wasted this time for several weeks in a row at Big Grove and don't plan on doing so again for a long time.  There are plenty of other options in the area.",

                "review": "Thank god for this place. That's really all I can say. Well no, I can say more. But before I get to the meat of my review, no pun intended, let me say that Big Grove Tavern is exactly what this town needed. When Jim Gould's closed I was sad to see it go but what has come in it's place is something really fantastic. From the food to the interior to the crowd, the energy Big Grove gives off is infectious and demonstrates that the confluence of intellect and small-town charm in Champaign can really lead to something amazing.Now on to the food:Popcorn: Come for free as a starter. While I was hoping for bread, I was even happier with this. The popcorn really whets your appetite without being too filling. I hear the flavor changes; it was definitely some kind of lime (think the hint of lime you find certain Mexican foods) flavor when I was there.Tavern Burger: There are so many things I can say about the Tavern Burger. First and most simply, it's delicious. The blend of bison was for me, the most prominent of the three meats that make up the burger but overall I found it to be rich, meaty and just the right amount of gamey given the bison. The onion marmalade, and petite crusty bun complimented the burger without overpowering the taste of the meat. I opted to add the fried egg which led to messy experience given the soft yolk, but a certainly more delicious one. At this point, if I did this right, you are so convinced about the deliciousness of the burger you won't even care to hear about the fries. But hey, if you're still interested: they're completely well-executed- crisp yet still potatoey. Now... onto my other comment on the Tavern Burger. There was some review on here about how the burger is in limited quantities. That's how you know it's fresh and locally sourced! If I wanted something from a freezer I'd head down by the mall and swallow some hormone-laced, bacon-cheese-blue cheese-fried onion-black forest-ham-ranch dressing-heart attack in a bun. If you want a burger that satisfies your burger craving while still being an appreciable entree and cut of meat, come enjoy the Tavern Burger. And if you've missed it, just come back and try again! And frankly, at 12 bucks, it's not that bad. The downtown Champaign restaurant scene generally errs on the more expensive side. Given what Jim Gould's prices used to be like, Big Grove is far more reasonable price-wise in comparison. In sum, ignore the hate, embrace the love, Big Grove will have you leaving full, happy and pleasantly surprised by what Champaign has to offer food-wise.",

                "review": "I was glad to see something young and fresh in place of Jim Gould. Gould was boring and dated, but the only option we had in the C-U if you wanted to go to a \"nice\" restaurant. Big Grove Tavern has a casual updated atmosphere with an original concept for the C-U (farm to table). We wanted to go to Destihl (right across from Big Grove) yesterday for lunch,  but there was a wait and we couldn't wait. We finally had a chance to try Big Grove. There was no wait, and we were seated right away. We were with our 2.5 year old, and  we have never gone to a kid restaurant. Our daughter is used to dining in grown up restaurants with grown ups, but even the most patient of young foodies could use a quiet distraction while they wait.  Destihl is not a kids' restaurant, but they have a variety of foods to choose from on the kids' menu and they give the kids crayons to color on the kids' menu. Smart and simple concept that works well. The server at Big Grove said they do not have a kids' menu, but they have \"kid friendly\" options. All they had was grilled cheese and sweet potato fries. I asked if we could just get regular potato fries and the server said \"yes\" so that is what my daughter got. I never understood the whole trend of replacing delicious french fries with sweet potato fries--they don't taste better nor are they \"healthier\" or much lower in calories. If you are going to eat fries make them from potatoes not sweet potatoes. I wanted to order a burger, but all their burger options are a blend of beef, bison and pork and I don't want to eat bison so I ordered the Black Bean Burger.  My husband ordered \"The Baltimore\"which is basically a BLT with avocados. My daughter's fries had more salt than there is in salt. Maybe it was just that day, but someone went really heavy handed with the salt. My Black Bean Burger was really good. It's not what I wanted to eat, but if you are vegetarian (I have been on and off for years) this was delicious. My husband's order was okay. It's a BLT with avocado. Why take a classic and add something that adds nothing? The server was great--very nice person and efficient. The design and layout of the restaurant is great. Casual and open. Trying to be a gastropub, but misses the mark with the menu. It's still a big step up for the C-U in terms of dining options. I liked this place. I like the concept, the layout, the service, but the menu is not for me. The food is not bad, but not great. Too many options like a classic burger or BLT are turned into things that are trying too hard to be \"cheffie\", but miss the mark. I just wish they didn't try to reinvent the wheel on these American food classics. If they're going to reinvent the classics they better make them better than the original. I would have liked to see a few classics taken up a notch with a gourmet twist or just a few classics done really well. Overall Big Grove is worth a try, but I wouldn't highly recommend it or anything because the food options are limited and the food tastes okay. Not great, just okay.",

When I asked the waitress she said my salad was on my sandwich...which did have a piece of lettuce on the bottom. Besides that my sandwich was very dry and tasteless. My lunch mate wanted a cup of chili and was told emphatically they only had bowls but when it arrived it was the smallest cup of chili I have seen and for 7$?  The cornbread was bigger than the cupAnother person in the party had the burger.  The 12$ burger. When it arrived it looked like a slider.  I do think he said it was good, but there are far better burger for a better price than 12$.Our bill for lunch for 4 was 70$. Way too expensive for lunch. Even a NYC lunch but the food was not worth it at all.

I was wrong...I was down in the U of I area during homecoming and made a reservation just in case it was packed for an early dinner. When we arrived, the place was empty. We were taken to our table and given this small one page menu. I thought it was the drink menu, but no, it was the dinner menu. A bit suprised, I asked my father if he would rather go to DESTIL across the street, but he wanted to try this new local joint. We decided that I was going to get the \"famous\" burger and my dad was going to get the Mac and Cheese. Our server came over and my dad started by ordering the Mac and Cheese, but he asked if he could get it without the onions (shallots and leeks). He was told NO because they already have it premixed. Premixed? She assured him that there was not alot of onions so we continued. For $12 on the burger and $14 for the Mac and Cheese, we were expecting something spectacular. My burger came out. It was a mix of bison, beef, and pork. I was expecting something very flavorful. It was bland as could be. Also, it was about 1/8 of a pound. One of the smallest burgers I have ever eaten. The fries that came with this was good, but the dish was not worth it. My dad's Mac and Cheese came out in a small bowl and half of it was made up of shallots and leeks. I tasted it and thought that it was good, but he HATED it. We had the manager called over and he took it away and took it off of the bill without us asking. He asked if we wanted something else, but my dad complained that the menu was too small for him to go with anything else. Instead of apologizing, the manager told him \"well its all local\" and he walked away. Our server was nice, but I could overhear the hostess and the manager talking about future reservations for the night with an attitude and snarky responses to each other. People can hear you folks!  It was as if they were doing us a favor by being open. In short, skip this place and go to other places within a block of this place. They know how to treat their customers and not to overcharge. I would suggest Guido's!",

Everything blended together perfectly... A medley of flavor so irresistible it has me drooling and wishing I could come back for more. You can trust me on this. I like food. A lot. But this burger changed my life. Buy the Tavern Burger. You won't regret it. One thing I would say: their definition of how well the meat is done is different than most, it is much less cooked than what a usual burger would be. Probably rule of thumb would be to order up from what you usually get if you don't like or are picky about how pink your meat is. i.e. If you're like me and like your burger \"medium rare\" order \"medium\" if you really don't like your meat any more pink than what you are used to. I would highly recommend this restaurant to all people looking for an exceptional and creative meal.",

Second, she had the short rib and I had the mac and cheese. Everything about the short rib dish was perfect. I mean, really everything tasted amazing. The mac and cheese was just not as cheesy as I want out of my mac and cheese. The bacon tasted good in the dish but I probably wouldn't get it again. (5 stars for everything besides the mac and cheese. 3 stars for the mac and cheese).",

His salad was yummy. My soup was ok but the salmon made up for it. My son had the pork shoulder very tender and flavorful. Even their ginger ale had a different and unique taste. My daughter had the tavern burger -mmmm she loved it! We all enjoyed the chili fries. The dessert was an apple crisp. I enjoyed it but was pretty sure I ordered a different dessert because no one in my family likes apples. However, since everyone was pretty full we opted for keeping the erroneous yet delicious sweet. I cannot emphasize enough they have amazing customer service!",

It was cold and hard, and i wouldn't have been surprised if someone told me it came from Sams.   The most disappointing for me was the coffee, as it was only lukewarm.   I should have asked for a new pot, but by this time our waitress wasnt around much.  I feel like she probably just needed trained better ( she came frequently when not needed and infrequently when required,  she also didn't know how to read when the table was ready to order or needed anything).  All that being said... it was a nice restaurant and i would return for brunch.  I'm not sure it's  worth the dinner prices,  but it's definitely worth the brunch prices.",

We each got a deviled egg ($1 each) and they were good, a little on the salty side though.  We also enjoyed the small bucket of popcorn you get for free.  Hubby's burger came with a huge pile of fries (good because the burger is $12, cheese is $1.50 extra) and I got a mixed green salad with my grilled cheese.  The vinaigrette on the salad was a bit salty as well.  The food was okay, the service was great, I like the fact that everything is locally sourced.  We might be back for dinner sometime, but we'll see...it's very expensive.",

I had the falafel, which was a tad dry, but it's falafel, and this is easy to screw up - forgivable.  The other dishes were great.  Excellent turkey sandwich, though the sourdough is a bit airy for my tastes.  A traditional sourdough needs some ... sourness and doughiness - this really does taste like airy French or Italian bread. The saged popcorn is a nice touch, but I have been here about seven times, and it is always saged popcorn, and the server consistently says \"Our popcorn -today- is fried sage\". ... which to me implies that this will change once in a while.  In my experience, it does not. Finally, and this has been said *dozens* of times here.  The prices are completely out of line with Champaign.  I can get locally sourced ingredients to create a Turkey sandwich and mixed green salad at the local grocery, and a 10oz bottle of the same beer.  Grand total will be well under $20 with a full six pack and ingredients to spare. My damage for lunch?  $23 after a modest tip.  The following day I had a (good) soup of Yellow Beet root and mixed green salad.  To be clear, we are talking about a CUP of soup and a small plate of salad, for $18. Completely out of touch with the local area and absolutely haranguing customers on the guise of farm-to-table.  Want to like it based on the food, can't stand to be here based on the price.

Good atmosphere, good service, good beer.Full review:Based on my two trips to the Big Grove, it seems to be hit or miss.The first time I went, around January of 2014, I was extremely impressed. I had pork belly as an appetizer (amazing) with a Dogfish Head 90 minute to chase it down (the beer selection is pretty great). For dinner, I had a perfectly cooked steak (don't remember the cut), served alongside gnocchi. Everything I ate was relatively simple, but they executed perfectly on the local, farm to table ingredients (they're proud of that here). Service was fantastic.The second time I went, in July 2014, the food was very disappointing. The steak was solid again, but it was served alongside one of the most bitter, poorly cooked broccolini I've ever had the displeasure of tasting. The pork tendorloin was chewy, definitely do not recommend. And this time, the pork belly appetizer was served differently, as a salad. I think it's pretty difficult to screw up pork belly, but they managed to do so. It tasted as if it were cooked a day ago, and it was difficult to find much pork belly beneath the greens. Service was tremendous on both occasions. Our water and popcorn (the popcorn is great) were refilled consistently, and the waiter seemed to take pride in the food.",

There are these cute containers of popcorn on the table. The popcorn is salty, but sweet, nice touch! I checked in on foursquare and got a free deviled egg! The deviled egg was very tasty and different than anything I've ever had.. The egg with the combination of cabbage was tasty! The beer menu was pretty big, which we liked. Unfortunately, we were told right away that they were out of the bison burger, which is one of the reasons we chose this place, so that was very disapointing. I ordered the Mac and Cheese and hubby ordered the steak that came with potatoes and veggies, well done. We had a couple rounds of drinks and our food came. My mac and cheese was good, but a bit dry because of the amount of bread crumbs. I feel like the bread crumbs needed to have more butter or moisture. The cheeses and bacon made this macaroni and cheese pretty good. It isn't something I'd order again for $14, but I liked it. My husbands steak, seemed awfully small for a $20 meal. Probably about 4 oz of meat. Plus, it was cooked more medium than medium well. The sides on the plate were pretty good. Overall, the place was nice, but a bit overpriced for the portions.",

During graduation weekend I attempted to make reservations for 10 (I know...bad idea!) and was told that they were only taking reservations for 8, which I understood, but the hostess proceeded to tell me that if more than 8 showed up she would be obliged to charge my credit card. I didn't argue over the 8 person rule, so why would that be her response?! On a separate occasion I've had my reservation lost which led to a 30 minute wait.  The food: the deviled eggs are always a delight and the drinks are above average. I find the entrees to be a hit or miss as they can sometimes be too salty but the burger is always a solid bet.",

On such a beautiful day we couldn't justify sitting in a dimly lit, empty restaurant. Luckily there were plenty of other brunch spots across the street who were much more accommodating and friendly.

The staff were quite friendly and efficient, and the food was very good. Probably the highlight of the meal was the popcorn instead of bread or rolls; the night we went it was flavored with roasted fennel seed and lemon zest. I usually don't like the taste of anise, but this was really good, and we got free refills without asking.We ordered a vegetarian ragout (creamy with a hint of spiciness), the burger (it's big burger a unique taste from the mix of beef, pork, and bison), the pork shoulder (cooked perfectly), and the pork sausage (after the waitress checked on us, we discovered the root vegetables weren't cooked well enough; the dinner is on a low-carb diet and wasn't going to eat them anyway, but the waitress was very receptive when we mentioned it later). Also two beers--I can't remember which. We didn't have room for dessert, but if it's still on the menu, I want to try the spiced pumpkin bread pudding. Hello? Heaven is calling...Pros: good, local food; great staff; reasonable prices at the \"expensive for a college student\" level (c. $15 per entree)Cons: dim lighting + aging eyes + small print on the drink menu = squintingnoise level --All too often it seems that chic decor and sound-proofing are non-intersecting circles of restaurant interior design. Would it be possible to put some fabric or panels on the ceiling to absorb some of the sound?",

They didn't even have an omelette, which was very surprising (and a bit disappointing).Let me say though, the bacon was cooked to perfection. Lots of taste and not too crispy. Potatoes were surprisingly tasty, and the eggs were eggs. Service was impeccable: there are few places that keep up with how much water I drink.I thought for such a basic dish it was a little pricey at $10, but I must admit that it was really well done.So my three star comes down to...+ flavor+ service+ bacon powdered popcorn- price- selection",

Our server was as friendly as could be and gave great suggestions for our meal. The cocktail she recommended to me- I think it was called a Georgia Peach?- was yummy, though it tasted much more like melon than peach. The Seared Pork Belly was totally decadent- buttery, full of umami flavor and perfectly crisp on the outside. Mom got the Faroe Islands Salmon, which was excellently cooked, though the lentils were a touch under-salted. We shared the Apple and Pear Crisp for dessert, which was delicious as well, but my entree really won the night.I ordered the Roasted Mushroom and Poached Farm Egg. I'd originally planned on the Mac n Cheese, but our waitress persuaded me to give the egg dish a shot, and I am so incredibly happy I did. The egg was poached impeccably, and when the yolk broke over those grits, I nearly wept. Everything about it, from concept to execution, was excellent. The grits were rich and creamy, the mushrooms were delightfully earthy and tender, and whatever they did to that sauce was magical. I honestly feel a little depressed that I'll never get to eat it again. It keeps me up at night.On second thought, maybe I should give them 1 star, because they ruined my life with their amazing food. Thanks a lot, guys.",

First off, I love farm-to-table restaurants and Big Grove Tavern does a really great job of utilizing local and regional farms. One of my favorite parts of the restaurant is a large map displayed on their wall that pinpoints where each of their ingredients comes from - how awesome is that! When it comes to the restaurant's atmosphere, it's trendy mix of both contemporary and rustic chic. The ceilings are lit with old-fashioned string lights and vintage lightbulbs, and hanging above the bar are driftwood chandeliers. After flipping through the clipboard dinner menu, I decided on the free-range roasted chicken with herb dumplings, green beans, shiitake mushrooms, and fingerling potatoes. The portion size is good, but the flavor was not anything spectacular. The chicken was juicy, but the rest of the dish was undercooked - especially the green beans and fingerling potatoes. All in all, this average tasting dinner dish was not worth $19. For dessert I decided on the girl scout thin mint brownie sundae, complete with mint ice-cream, brownies, chocolate ganache, and sprinkled with peppermint candy (I mean come on, who doesn't love thin mints?) It may have been served in a glass goblet, but unfortunately my expectations of this dessert were much too high. The brownie and ice-cream were good, but the whole dish was overloaded with crushed peppermint candy - it ruined the flavor of the rest of the dessert! I would not recommend wasting $7 on this glorified sundae. Next time I'm in Champaign, I'll be trying out another restaurant in hopes of getting my money's worth.",

These things were addicting. I shared a little, but not much! Gotta love some good brussel sprouts. I still don't get why kids hate these things so much???Then since I ate vegetables to start like a good kid (I know, yes they were fried, but come on, let me have my cake and it too, okay?), I thought that granted me the ability to get their mac and cheese in a little oven baked dish packed with tons of cheese, bacon, leeks, fried shallots, and then as it should be, topped with crumbled bread crumbs! Mmmmmm that mac and cheese was exactly how I like my mac and cheese! Hot, creamy, cheesy, goodness. Done and done. Plus they had a good beer selection here too, the only thing I think that was missing was more attentive service since I would have ordered more beer if they had come around more quickly and the water service, but pretty minor! I definitely would come back here if I visited again!",

Since that initial visit, I have now tried their chicken and dumplings and the skirt steak. The chicken was lovely, moist and well seasoned, the dumplings, however, were a bit of a downer--they were SALTY, small, and sparse, nothing exciting. I might try the dish again, but will have to ask them to be mindful of their salt. The skirt steak was cooked as requested (medium) and was surprisingly tender. I think that they change the accompanying veggies seasonally, but it's always served with a chimichurri (sauce). Given that chimi is one of my favorite sauces, I'll admit that I was skeptical of trying it in Champaign, and was pleasantly surprised--the downfall, they serve it as decorative dots on the plate, rather than a sauce for the meat so there's hardly any of it to enjoy! As you can see, my review of the food has much improved since my first post. I still think that it is overpriced for the portions and location (come on it's Champaign!). My last waitress was pretty good--so service also seems to have improved (or I might've just been lucky).",

The food was good but not great. We also ordered ice cream for my granddaughter's birthday and a sweet potato cake that was dry and had a weird after taste.  Our bill came to $80 FRICKN dollars!!! Way way over priced!! This reminds me of Jim Goulds that went out of business for this reason!!I agree with previous reviews that they are trying too much to be different and have Chicago or New York prices. In conclusion, we were there for over 90 minutes (with a 3 year old), food was good but not great and extremely over priced..will not return as there are many better options in Champaign-Urbana.",

For drinks, my S.O. had two 20 oz. Schlafly Klsch and I tried the Cherry Wheat.  The draft of Schafly was the way to go.  Along came two delightful, Deviled Eggs.  It was superb when paired with the pickled pepper relish.  I almost went with the Seared Walleye, but decided to indulge on a burger with my bf instead.  I've never had a combination of beef, bison, and pork.  Both were cooked to a perfect medium.  However, he ordered his with the additions Amish white cheddar and a fried egg, with the marmalade and aioli on the side.  I ordered mine with everything and a fried egg.  The red onion marmalade was amazing!  I was eating my fries with the bf's side portion.  Next time, I'm asking for extra!  It was so messy, but well worth the lean-in at the bar.  I almost forgot!  The seasoned fries were crispy and well-portioned.",

It was served half-cold and dry-ish like someone just heated by a frozen pack without caring to garnish it with even the slightest bit of flavor or hardwork. The fingerling potato salad came with a honey mustard dressing, which is okay. But who in the world would pair already bitter rhubarb with a mustard sauce to create one of the most horrible tastes one can experience. The chef at big grove, of course. This was a waste of time and money and I'm never going here again.",

Alas, it is not to be.In spite of many available tables, we were seated in a dark and cavernous (all in black) alcove.  Although elsewhere it was the bright light of day, we were barely able to make out the menu in the darkness.  We ordered wine by the glass to start; they waved the bottle over the glass and delivered a very small quantity for a full price pour.  Actually, I like the option of small-glass, but only if they offer the option of paying accordingly...I've had larger pours at free wine tastings around town.  Illinois is beer country, and as they are going local perhaps we would have been better to order a local brew.We waited a long time for our food, allowing our meager splash of wine to warm in the glass so as to save the few swallows to have with our meal.  At long last when it arrived, the spouse's was pleasant enough but mine was not at all as described.  I had ordered the chicken salad on wheat bread with greens; one of the few sandwiches that did not say it was served with chips. All flavors were erased by a thick layer of Dijon mustard and it was served on very dried out toast with chips on the side.  The \"greens\" were a piece of lettuce inserted between the mass of mustard and the dried out bread.  The person at the next table ordered the same dish and had the same impression, asking the waitress where the greens were and commenting on the dried out toast. It was supposed to have tarragon and other interesting ingredients, but every flavor was eclipsed by the strong Dijon mustard.Don't know if it was the worst lunch I had since moving here last summer, but it was clearly the most expensive bad lunch I have had, approaching $50 for two sandwiches--one nearly inedible--and a smidgeon of wine. This was very expensive for mixed quality, not a good value.Pluses: I like that they are trying to source from local farms, although I missed having a fish or seafood option on the menu.  The staff was very friendly. Minuses: Expensive, very small portions, descriptions on menu not accurate, food quality uneven, some bad seating locations.  I gave it two stars for the effort to source locally and the friendliness of the staff.  I a willing to give them a try again in a couple of months to see if they iron out the kinks, but only if I am feeling extravagant.",

But what runs a restaurant is the food, and we gave it plenty of tries.In January we were in for a date night on the weekend and we told they had oysters! Oh how we miss them. The server seemed pretty confused on how they came, what they were and what sauce came with it, so we went ahead and gave it shot. How can you mess up an oyster, right? Well, good god this was so disgusting! The oysters were on ice, but filled to the brim with this gross creamy orange liquid that was tepid and just...GROSS! It totally covered the whole flavor of the oyster and was absolutely a disgrace to the beauty that's an oyster. So tepid sauce and somewhat cold oyster - feels like a temperature danger zone to me. So again, I'm thinking, the chef is from SF and she does that to an oyster?! Yikes. We then decided to not order dinner because of those oysters (and didn't want to seem like cheapskates) and got the chocolate budino. That dessert is supposed to be pudding-like, but was SO hard and impossible to put a spoon, knife and fork in. So we sat and waited for it to get a little softer, but it was more like a little jar of chocolate that was melted and then refrigerated back into a chocolate bar. That was in no way rich and creamy and custard-like. I would call it \"Chocolate Brick In A Cute Mason Jar\".Came back again and had Sunday brunch as there are limited options in Champaign-Urbana. I ordered the chicken hash and my partner got the huevos rancheros...I think. My chicken hash was full of those bits of chewy cartilage-like chicken that you would, ya know, throw away! Not one piece was edible chicken. I felt absolutely jipped and told the server who didn't seem to care or knew what to do? And the scone we got was just a rock hard lump of dough over baked. I mean you could use that thing as a weapon, lol. So depressing for such a beautiful restaurant and concept. :-/As some have said in their reviews, too: the food is nothing extraordinary. Honestly, for each of our experiences it was pretty gross and I couldn't tell if we came in on off times or what, but not impressed at all. Yuck.",

                "review": "I decided on Big Grove after driving around Champaign for a few minutes, and I wasn't disappointed.It was a really nice day out, and since I parked in a nearby lot, I had to decide between here and Destihl. I looked at both menus, and frankly, because big grove was second, I stayed there. I opted to sit outside, in the sun. It was not bad at all.Onto the  experience... first of all, my waitress was great and very attentive. Each table gets a little bowl of popcorn to start, which is cool. Anyways, their menu is locally sourced, and quite small. They have a few appetizers, and I indulged in two of them. I had a deviled egg (dollar per), and I also ordered the pickled vegetables (radish, onion, fennel, and carrot). The deviled egg came with a rye crisp and sauteed red onions. It was okay, and I'm glad I only ordered one. On the other hand, the pickled vegetables were fantastic! A little pricey at 3 dollars, but definitely the highlight of my meal.For my main course, I ordered the pork, bison, and beef burger. I had the aioli and red onion marmelade on the side. I like my burgers medium. I also ordered mine on whole grain bread instead of the standard bun.The burger was average. It was not cooked medium well, and there was some yellow sauce (not the aioli, but possibly a mustard) that ended up on my burger, even though I asked for my burger plain. My mixed greens salad with the vinagrette was good. My second favorite part, and I'm not a salad fan at all.Overall, a decent place. Nothing special. My bill was 17 dollars, and I did not order a drink or anything. I like the feel of the restaurant, but honestly, I'll probably go somewhere else in the area before I head back here.",

For dinner we tried 4 of the 6 starters and all I have to say is that the hash browns were excellent and I could probably eat the pickled veggies every day and never tire of them. The Pate is a must try and the deviled eggs are just perfect. We tried 4 of the soups/salads and while I was not a fan of the seared pork belly, others at the table thought it was very good but the cheesy grits on the bottom were amazing. The cornbread was delightful (almost as good as Black Dog) and the chili just right. I look forward to trying the other items. The entrees were a great size and very well done. I had the pan seared fish which was perfectly cooked and had a side of pickled veggies. The cornbread stuffing on another plate was so good. The chicken was very tasty. The steak was cooked to a great temp. We also had the mac and cheese, they seem to understand that people like cheese and bacon because this dish did not disappoint. I plan on going for dinner many times. For lunch we were disappointed that the burger had already run out but we will have to go back earlier to try it. The steak sandwich was very good but the star on that plate was the Sweet Potato Chips, they were absolutely delicious. The horseshoe was very good and I especially enjoyed the sauce. I will be heading over there again for lunch very soon.This place is a great addition to downtown Champaign and a great replacement to Jim Gould's. The decor is very well suited to the atmosphere the place is trying to convey. I love that they expanded the bar. The prices are a bit high compared to some of the other places downtown but the food is of such a great quality that it is well worth the price.My biggest disappointment is that I am always too full to try the desserts because they look very good.",

                "review": "I have been to Big Grove a few times, with mixed results, but lunch today will be my last visit. Service:When we arrived, the restaurant was less than half full. Our server's name was Daniel. My friend and I ordered Chili Cheese Fries as an appetizer (I specified that we wanted it out first) and two sandwiches as the main course. About twenty minutes passed and our sandwiches came out, carried by a different server. I asked him about our appetizer and he had no idea. He found our server at the wait station, who then came over and without any apology told us that the kitchen had messed up our tickets. He returned with the app a minute later and mumbled something about the Chili Cheese Fries taking longer on average than the Cuban sandwich which I had ordered. The Cheese Fries were soggy and lukewarm. First of all, I absolutely hate it when a server blames the kitchen. It is so petty, and makes the whole restaurant look bad, especially at a place which supposedly prides itself on it's chef-driven sensibilities. Next, there is no way that a plate of chili fries takes longer than a Cuban sandwich. It was clear to me that the appetizer had sat in the window way too long, which is why it was tepid and soggy. This tells me that our app was finished by the kitchen in good time, and then just sat there until after our sandwiches had already been ran. No point having a chef in the kitchen if the food dies in the window. Even if the kitchen did screw up, which I highly doubt, the server is responsible for taking care of us and smoothing it over. Throwing the kitchen under the bus is a pathetic excuse. I cannot stand a person who won't take accountability for the mistakes. Next: Halfway through my sandwich, I decided to order a second beer, as the draught list there is excellent. Not only did our server fail to offer me a refill, but I COULD NOT get his attention. I spent over ten minutes waving my hands, trying to get him to our table. I'm going to repeat that this place was far from busy. I watched him bus tables, have personal conversations with other staff, and generally ignore us. I ended up flagging down the second server who ran our food, who took my order to Daniel (who was standing at the bar talking to staff.) After another five minutes, he managed to produce my order. Completely unsatisfactory. Fifteen minutes to order and receive a beer during a slow lunch is unbelievable. At this point, we had been seated for almost an hour. Daniel then dropped the check and returned our receipt with no kind words, apology, or gratitude for coming. We did not feel welcomed or taken care of at all. Simply some of the worst service I've had in CU. Food:Chili Cheese Fries would have been tasty had they been hot and fresh. No one likes soggy fries. Inattention ruined that dish. My Cuban was shy on meat and priced at $12. Destihl, right across the street, also offers a Cuban sandwich with way more meat priced at $10. The flavor with Grove's version was good, but the value sucked. My friend enjoyed her Grilled Cheese. Conclusion:  After a half-dozen visits over the last 18 months, both for lunch and dinner, we have not had one satisfactory meal, due to sub-par service.  There is no point sourcing your produce and protein from local farms if the kitchen is sabotaged by terrible service and high price-points. Over-hyped and not worth the money. This place is all hat and no cattle. We will not return and will tell everyone we know to avoid it.",

Sometimes it is a little slow, but servers are always friendly and do their best for you.The So-So: *menu tends towards fancified home cooking, which is not a bad thing.  But given that, it seems a bit overpriced for what you get.  The food we've had as been consistently okay, but not amazing.  Dinner?  Okay.  Brunch (which I really, really wanted to love)?  Again, just okay.  If you don't cook a lot at home, this can be a great place for you.  If you are a successful and inventive home cook, you might not be as impressed.  Con:**This is the thing that makes me not want to give Big Grove another chance.  We were in about 6 months ago (August), and both ordered the burger.  We requested some tomato to go with it, and the waitress came back- somewhat sheepishly, to her credit- and told us that the kitchen didn't serve it with tomato.  Okay.  I've been to fine dining restaurants, and I understand that chefs conceptualize the flavors of a dish in a particular way, and that's the way they want you to experience it.  But a burger?  And, more importantly, this burger?  It's fine, but it's not all that.  Perhaps they were just out of tomatoes?  But anyway, the fact that they were so proud of this burger keeps gnawing at me.  Overall:*Good drinks, fine ambience, good service.  In the greater scheme of things, they are still fairly new, so maybe they'll continue to evolve?  I hope so, because I'd love to see them reach a little bit higher; there seems to be potential for more here.",

This place takes both reservation and walk-ins, which was very helpful during graduation weekend when all the restaurants are packed.First impression: the place is trendy - you can sit in the bar area, tables, booth, or even outside during the summer. During brunch people come in their sweatshirt and sweatpants, but the dinner crowd is more well-dressed. I had a good experience with the service everytime I go to this place. They serve you popcorn with spices of the day as a complementary snack.Dinner:I came here with my vegetarian friend so all the items we ordered from the menu is vegetarian!- Devilled eggs: delicious, but not dying for it- Chilled roasted beets: very very delicious - I honestly prefer the beets to the devilled eggs for appetizer- Roasted sunchoke risotto: Errr... It's just ok. I've had better risotto before. I think it's a little bland- Veggie mac and cheese: Also just ok. Among all 4 items we order, I like the beets the most!Brunch:To be fair, I've been ordering the same thing over and over again: CHILAQUILES. My mouth is literally watering as I am writing this. It is absolutely heavenly!!! The tortilla is well covered in spices and it is between crunchy and soft corn tortillas. The shredded chicken is so soft and it melts in my mouth! MUST TRY! The portion is very generous I usually can't finish the whole plate in one meal.My boyfriend had the eggs benedict before and he said it was good, but it's something you can find anywhere!Did I mention they have good selection of cocktails? LOVE THE BLOODY MARY!! Overall I give 3 stars for the dinner and 5 for the brunch and thus 4 stars!! It's also a good place to chill and drink on sat/ Friday night.",

I did not get the Aioli on my burger.  It was DELICIOUS!  for me the fried egg made this burger one of, if not THE best in Champaign/Urbana.  And i've had what is considered to be in the top 5 in america at Kuma's Corner in Chicago, its not that good, or that big, but its plenty excellent.  the house cut fries were very good too, i loved the seasoning.my wife raved about the Beer Brined Pork Loin, saying it was \"delicious\".  The place is a little pricy, but they also have very close attention to detail and the food is all from local area suppliers, which is a nice touch and compliment to the local growers.I will be back again at this restaurant, i can't wait to try the BLT with the egg at lunch next!",

                "review": "I was really close to leaving a 3 star review, but Big Grove pulled through in the end!My folks came down to visit and we wanted to grab some dinner. We got in at 4:30 and the server informed us we couldn't order dinner until 5, so we got a table and dissected the menu for ~30 minutes, ordered some drinks, and a bar snack or two.We opted to sit outside on a beautiful Sunday evening. Though I must mention the inside of Big Grove has a cool ambiance. Very dark/modern types of colors with some interesting tree/woodwork stuff hanging from the ceiling.Wine by the glass happened to be half off that evening, which was a pleasant surprise. I had a smoother French one which I forget the name of and my mother had a French Malbec, I tried to look them up online when I got home but it seems their wine list isn't 100% up to date online. Dad opted for a beer, the Left Hand Milk Stout Nitro, which ironically my roommate just ordered last weekend at Black Dog! He really enjoyed it but thought it wasn't served cold enough. No frosty glass, kind of a turn off for my Pops....We started with the deviled eggs and hushpuppies. The eggs were just OK and I thought the hush puppies were pretty tasty, especially with the sauce they came with! My mother said they were just fair.For dinner, my Uncle got the Free-Range chicken which he liked a lot. He particularly enjoyed the chicken jus as well as the dumplings that came with it. Mom and Dad split the short ribs, which they both thought were exceptional, and believe me, my mother is highly critical of short ribs, since she can cook up some mighty fine ones herself. I can verify via taste that these were not your average short ribs, I'd highly recommend these. On a last second split decision between the skirt steak and the pork tenderloin, I opted for the latter. This was also a really well put together dish that came with carrots, endive, and these glorious sweet potato hash brown patty things. The pork itself was done a perfect medium-rare and was flavorful, juicy and overall a nicely executed plate that would not have been the same without the creamy mustard sauce it was all sitting on.We did have some qualms which would have normally warranted only a 3 star review if it wasn't for how well everyone enjoyed their entrees. The beer I mentioned above could definitely have been served colder. Our server didn't seem to take the hint when my dad mentioned he liked frosty glasses. Our other major qualm would be the price to portion ratio. My parents split the short ribs and when they were finished they were still kind of hungry. Be warned, if you want to be at least a little full, don't share an entre, the portions are pretty small. The place is also comparably expensive, all of these entrees nearly required a $20 bill or more. We thought the clipboard menus were a little tacky for a place of this caliber.I do like the farm-to-table concept, I also really admire and respect Big Grove's local sourcing of foods. My only constructive criticism would be to actually put where each dish comes from on the menu, such as:\"Grilled Pork Tenderloin - Farm XYZ: _____, IL\".As an avid organic and local food fan, adding this type of notation makes me feel much better than simply, \"local\". Common Ground Co-Op in Urbana does a fairly good job of  this.Overall, a very pleasant dinner on a gorgeous day.",

                "review": "I have never been to the MIdwest--except 3 days in Chicago in heat and humidity so intense I remember almost nothing--but can say without question that this restaurant would be a hit even in NYC or LA. I ate here twice on a visit, once for lunch and once for dinner, and was initially struck by the sheer beauty--and size--of the restaurant. It gets crazy busy on a Friday night and appears to be the only upscale bar in the area.Recommended dishes: 1) Veggie mac and cheese2) Chili: cup or bowl, cornbread on the side3) Lake Trout (I don't even like trout--it's my least favorite fish, likely because I have only had river trout with the bones and almonds and butter, but this was sublime with horseradish sauce)4) Pate which rivals the best I've eaten and is my personal favorite because it's mousse-like and light and not too heavy/strong but still exquisitely flavorful: it's better than the chicken livers at the Public Kitchen at Hollywood and served almost identically at a far lower price5) Fried grits--I know, this doesn't sound good at all but it has a chipotle aioli and for a decadent fried treat, you can't do better. I didn't know much about grits, as an LA girl, but apparently you can cook them without much fat and then unceremoniously dump a big hunk of butter on top so that it's like cream of wheat with butter, or you can do it more like the French with butter and cream, in which case it's far worse for you but tastes infinitely better. Executive chef Jessica Gorin subscribes to the second school of grit preparation and I wholly approve. 5) Beets: they were as good as the Purple Pig in Chicago but this is a \"bar bite\" (see below) so if you want a large portion, order two. 6) Chocolate bread pudding: this dessert rivals the Olio e Limone chocolate bread pudding with bananas which Julia Child cited as among her favorite desserts in Santa Barbara7) Pork belly: this has become trendy of late and some restaurants are pulling it from menus in big cities as people seem to be over it to some extent but Big Grove Tavern hits it out of the park with this appetizer. 8) Burger: some people in the area carped about the price of the burger here, not realizing that this is standard in LA and NYC (actually, their burger is cheaper than most fine dining burgers in cities I travel or live) and it's sheer perfection with the onions and cheese. The prices are reasonable and they offer a sort of mini-appetizer they call a \"bar bite,\" for 3 to 5 dollars. This is a nice option as you can try all sorts of sides for not a lot of money. The watercress soup was beautiful and subtle but the only dish on the menu that didn't send me into another galaxy. I truly believe Big Grove Tavern would be a hit in a city. In Champaign, which is a college town that feels infinitely smaller than it really is, with very few fine dining options, I see why the place is booming and if I lived in this tiny place, I'd eat here three times a week.",

I am so happy that Champaign downtown has Big Grove Tavern! We sat at the bar for drinks and dinner. They had an excellent beer selection, with several Midwest and even some local brews and seasonal ones. The bartender was very helpful and attentive. The night we went, they had recently roasted an entire pig, so their specials were these amazing pork dishes. I enjoy pork quite a bit - beer and pork - since I've lived in Berlin and love German cuisine, so this place made me really happy. Based on my one visit, I'd recommend this place to all my friends and family, and anyone visiting from out of town.",

We were advised that if we didn't have a reservation we would be sitting outside or at the bar due to a 45 minute wait.  Note that at the time we arrived 80% of the tables inside were empty - no problem, we enjoy sitting outdoors.  Side note: forty-five minutes later there are still twelve empty tables inside...We enjoyed the cumin flavored popcorn and ordered a wedge salad to share.  The wedge salad needs a little help (extra crumbles please) but the bacon had a distinct full smokey flavor and was very good.  We requested salt and pepper and they brought it out in little stainless dishes.  My wife ordered the scallops and I ordered the flank steak.  The scallops (four) were exceptionally good - flavorful and delicious.  The cornbread was just ok.  The flank steak was marginal but ok - served with delicious sides.  The wine and beer list is solid - lots of good choices.Good table service - steak could have been brought out hot off the grill but can't have it all.  My wife was unimpressed overall - note the menu prices are high. The atmosphere is upscale overall and the food presentation is excellent.  The menu options are limited.  The music is questionably appropriate for dinner but not offensive.",

Then the steak comes out, and it was way too salty. The sauce was too salty as it is, and then they added sea salt on it. When I told my waiter about it, some manager lady in her 40-50s came and took it back to have it redone. She did not apologize but instead shrugged and said \"that's the way we cook it here\";  face was stone cold and gave us a new set of silveware without saying a word. Talk about customer service. I do not know how this place stays in business with a manager like this. Bottom line is, if you're looking for a quick eat, then the food here is ok, comparable to steak and shake quality but 3x the price. If you're unlucky enough like me to see that manager with an attitude, then you're in for an experience.",

I had the trout dish last time and was extremely disappointed with the tiny piece of fish in the center of the huge plate it was served on. Not much flavor, not satisfying. The only menu item I would recommend is the Tavern burger. The service here is soooo slow. I took my mom here when she was visiting last month, wanting to give this place another try since the restaurant overall does have a nice atmosphere inside compared to other nearby places. Unfortunately I was disappointed again. It took our waiter too long to greet our table and then again too long to bring us our drinks. I ordered a pecan beer that he had suggested and when I tasted the beer, it seemed a little off but I figured that was just the flavor of it. Our meal took about an hour and a half to come out...and all we had ordered was a burger and the free range chicken dish. I think our waiter had forgotten to put in our orders till later. The couple seated next to us after we arrived had their meals a half hour before we did. When the check arrived, I see that my beer was in fact a $10 cider, not a $5 beer. Guess my taste buds were right. We paid the bill and left without complaining because we didn't feel like being there any longer than we were. Look, I understand things go wrong in restaurants and the server can't always control how long food takes and mistakes can be made. I am a server so I've been there. But I would've appreciated it if our server tried to do something to make up for our lackluster experience here. Not coming back here.",

If it were less expensive; maybe more in line with Blackdog or Dublin O'Neils prices it may have gotten 4 stars (whereas those other restaurants get 5 stars and 4 stars respectively). We started off with some deviled eggs that were good, and a fresh baked pretzel that had an unappealing mustard sauce.  I'll take Gulden's over that mustard sauce any day.  I ordered the burger and my girlfriend ordered a chicken salad sandwich.The burger was actually pretty good, cooked medium, with an egg and some onion maramalade on it.  The fries were decent but nothing to write about.The chicken salad was just a terrible sandwich.  Maybe one small scoop of flavorless chicken salad on hard toast for $9?  Get that thing off the menu.  Seriously.  People who order that sandwich will not come back.   The sweet potato chips on the side were pretty tasty though.Overall, not as great as I had hear, though maybe the chicken salad ruined the experience.  You want a burger, go to Blackdog or Farrens for a comparable one that costs half the price.  Want chicken salad better than this, go to your local gas station and buy a pre-made chicken salad.All that said, I'll give it another try.",

Love the fresh dinner rolls and the orange juice.",

We arrived and made a dash straight to the restrooms which we were happy to discover were very clean. We were a party of nine so they couldn't sit us at the same table so split us into two tables right next to each other, which suited us fine. Our waitress could not have been less thrilled to serve us. I don't think I saw her crack a grin, much less a smile, the entire time. The food was decent. The pancakes had a seriously tough exterior, but the eggs were yummy, the biscuits and gravy devine, and my toast wasn't overly buttered (Rebeca has me looking out for that now). I had asked for there to be two seperate checks since trying to figure out a nine person tab could get ugly, however when it came time to pay, one check. Thank goodness everyone just decided to split the cost, which was wonderfully affordable, instead of picking it apart cent by cent. Overall, a good travel spot for decent food.",

I can barely finish half of them even when I'm really hungry.  I'm a huge fan of breakfast potatoes, and I've never been disappointed with them here.  Everything I've tried has been pretty good, though nothing outstanding.  I think you could order just about anything without being disappointed, so long as you don't look at the nutritional information.I don't go here often, however, because it never sits well with me afterwards.

While I don't think that $18 a person is too much for a nice brunch every once in awhile, i do expect to get what I pay for.I don't want to be ignored by the hostess, then treated rudely by both her and the waitress.  Additionally, I expect the food to be restocked.  If you own a restaurant and advertise that brunch is offered until 2:30, the brunch should be stocked until that time.  If you want to stop stocking the brunch at 1:00, the advertise that the brunch ends at 1:00.  The good foods were omelets and waffles, smoked salmon and shrimp; the two things I could get cooked fresh, and the two things that are served best cold.  Everything else was cold, crusty crap.We were rushed by the waitress who couldn't be bothered to refill our drinks.  Busboys were texting, no one would check us out when it was time to pay.  In fact, the only nice people there were the bartender and the omelet chef.  I liked this place in the past, and if I have another chance to come back, I will...so I guess the have a chance to gain some stars.",

It's never my choice-- Champaign has a handful of restaurants where everyone goes when they're looking for a somewhat upscale experience and Silvercreek falls into this category. And so I find myself here for graduation celebrations, birthdays, meals for when relatives are visiting, and so on. Most of my experiences here have been for their Sunday buffet brunch. They offer your standard biscuits, gravy, bacon, potatoes, as well as some lunch-ier fare like pasta and prime rib. It is all less than mediocre. Last time I was there for brunch, my dad said, \"We should have gone to Ryan's.\" Ouch. They have a pretty big selection of desserts. It really grinds my gears that even though they have an omelet and waffle station, they can't make eggs to order because they only have a big bowl of premade egg mix on hand. So yeah, no fresh eggs on hand. They have scrambled eggs in the buffet line but... gross. Side note, try not to get seated by the omelet station. It gets boiling hot. Last time I was here, I actually dunked my cloth napkin in my water and dabbed my face and neck with it. I mentioned the heat to the hostess on the way out-- she asked how the meal was-- and her response was \"Oh, in the greenhouse? Yeah, hot day.\" No, not in the greenhouse. But that reminds me...My best friend had her bridal shower at Silvercreek about a year ago, in the greenhouse. In the middle of the meal, one of the chandeliers DROPPED FROM THE CEILING and shattered on the middle of a table. Unreal. The staff did not know how to handle the situation and the only compensation was free dessert. This place is such a mess.",

Since I try to eat vegan and I know it can be a pain to sort that out in a large party, I called ahead to ask if there were any vegan items on the menu.  The hostess was incredibly helpful, pointing me toward a couple of salads and a vegetarian entree that could easily be made vegan, and reassuring me that if nothing on the menu caught my eye, the chef would be more than happy to create something for me with the veggies and pasta they have available.Service at the restaurant was equally good.  I went with the autumn salad (Garden greens, apricots, pears, grapes, pecans, hazelnut vinaigrette) which was refreshing and delicious, and the stuffed poblano peppers (Black bean, corn & rice stuffing, red onion, cilantro, chihuahua cheese, paquillo pepper sauce) without the cheese.  The peppers were TO DIE for.  The pepper sauce was insane, creamy and delicious, yet somehow dairy free.  I still wish I had gotten that recipe!I'd definitely recommend Silvercreek for any vegans or non-vegans looking to get a high-quality meal!",

The restaurant has a warm & cozy feel to it - equipped with a full fireplace and lodge-esque interior.  The bread variety was quite delicious - esp. the olive and rye breads.  I ordered the jumbo shrimp appetizer (the name escapes me), which was incredibly spicy.  It was ok.  I also ordered the spinach salad, which was quite good.  My fiancee ordered the pot roast entree, which I sampled, and it was actually very good.  My friend ordered the brie appetizer, which was also quite tasty.  The only downside was the service, which was slightly lacking.  The price is moderate but nothing completely unreasonable.  They also have a nice selection of domestic and import beverages, which always makes me warm and fuzzy inside.",

Then there's other fancy meats, fish like whole smoked salmon, pastries, and of course, desserts.  The price tag is expensive for the Chambana area but the food selection will all be worth it.

Once we got seated, our waitress, \"Diana\" (?) greeted us immediately and was very knowledgeable about the menu, she was very nice and personable.  A few of us sampled the specialty drinks on the menu which were delicious.  I had the Lobster Bisque soup - holy crap, unbelievable!  I mean, I could have licked the bowl.  Another gentleman in my party pretty much did!  For my entree I had the filet, the quality of meat and preparation was so nice.  The way the Chef placed the meat on top of the potatoes and asparagus was very upscale, not to mention easily the best steak I have ever had.  The potatoes & asparagus perfectly complimented the flavor of the filet.  For dessert I had the flour-less chocolate cake.  No cake should ever have flour, as this was the best dessert I have ever had...  In my life.  I would HIGHLY recommend this restaurant, the price is reasonable and for a casual upscale dining you can't get any better!  Go there now!",

The dish definitely was a bit better than your standard macaroni fare, but I don't think it's good enough to warrant an $18 price tag. The Sunday buffet is similar. It costs $20 and the food is a bit better than your standard buffet food, but not enough to warrant the much higher price.",

It was August and it felt like the A/C was broken in there, I had to use a menu as a fan. Service was slow and rude (we waited about 10 minutes just to get a beer menu, which we had to make a special request for). Music was terrible and so loud I couldn't tune it out (bad slow jams and classic 70s tunes). My so-called  \"Roasted red pepper risotto\" had not red pepper, but contained raw green pepper.

It loses a couple stars because it wants to be a fine dining establishment with an accompanying pricetag, but the servers are generally not as experienced as you'd like (although they are trying, so it's not right to totally pan them).  And the food quality and inventiveness leaves something to be desired.  They have a good location, dining rooms, including a nice garden room, and it's quite comfortable overall.  It just needs an infusion of talent.For brunch, four stars.",

                "review": "We really wanted to like this place. I enjoy the farm-to-table, localvore style a lot. Our experience here was... less than optimal. I dined with my husband, and we had a late reservation. We had tickets to a performance at the Krannert, and wanted to eat dinner afterward. Silvercreek was one of the few places which had their kitchen open past 10, so we decided to check it out. We made a reservation, because we wanted them to know that we were coming. There were still two other tables dining when we got there, but that was it. I should have realized that something was wrong when I saw the totally empty parking lot at 10pm on a Saturday night.First problem: the place was really bright and the music was awful. Chain-restaurant bad 70s music and lighting. Not what I was expecting for the description of what they were going for or for their prices. Pros: the restored location is really charming, and with better lighting and a less cheap and intrusive soundtrack, the place could be beautiful.Second problem: the booth was dirty. The whole place was practically empty, they knew we were coming and they didn't bother to make sure that the table was clean?The menu is a nice one. We opted for the calamari to start, then my husband ordered the lamb and I ordered the duck. We like both medium rare, which is the standard way that both meats should be served.The food was just such a miss. The calamari was okay, and it would have been fine at Applebee's. For the price, a pile of frozen calamari rings (interspersed with pieces of fries and onion fritters - clean your fryer guys!) served with canned sauces is not the \"best of local, seasonal Illinois\". The entrees came out fast. I mean really fast. So fast that they were decidedly undercooked. I had already gotten a sense that even though the place was theoretically open for another hour, they were unhappy that we were there. Even though they knew we were coming. And they were open for another hour. Both the lamb and the duck were under rare. The cherry jam that was served accompanying my duck was refrigerator cold.We probably should have sent the food back, but it was obvious that the kitchen was hostile to the idea that people were bothering them an hour before they were even supposed to be closed, so I was somewhat afraid of what would happen if we did. Flat out: the kitchen shouldn't have sent out grossly undercooked food and the server shouldn't have brought the meat to our table that way. The message \"here's your food, eat and get the hell out so we can go home\" was not exactly subtle.The food would have been good if it had been cooked properly. The plate presentations were nice and the cherry jam was pretty good - nice warm spices and cherries cooked just soft enough. The jam would have been a great accompaniment to the duck, if it wasn't obviously straight out of the walk-in.It got worse, though. We had ordered a bottle of wine to share, and the entrees came out so fast that we were only half-way through. I'd noticed an \"artisinal cheese plate\" on the appetizer list. I figured that that would be something we could snack on while we finished our wine. Especially since the raw meat wasn't exactly a palatable meal. It also wasn't something that would take a whole lot of work from the kitchen, so I figured it would be safe. When she walked away from the table, the server yelled back to the kitchen \"Cheese plate coming\" Mel's diner-style. Seriously. The kitchen yelled something back to her about not knowing how to make one.The cheese plate was $19.00 for the large. What we got was a platter of cheese straight from the deli case at the local supermarket. Boursin, some sort of italian herb cheese, a really cheap Double Glouster, a brie and some bland white cheese. Not one of them were anything that would be close to artisan. Not one of them is \"the best of local, seasonal Illinois\". It was served with a handful of jarred black olives and a heaping scoop of the aforementioned ice-cold cherry jam. It wasn't an awful cheese plate, but it is not what it's advertised as, which is surprising since there are a fair number of artisan cheese producers in the area. For $19, I was expecting more than cold supermarket cheese.Soon after the cheese came the bill. No offer of desert, which is fine, since by that time we really wanted to get out of there and I could have stopped by the store on the way home and gotten some frozen pie if more stuff out of a box was where I wanted to go with the night.If you're looking for a nice meal, especially late, go elsewhere. The price they charge here does not match the atmosphere, service, quality or taste. It's more family dining, and it would have been great if the bill hadn't run to almost $200 (that's with wine, tax and tip). For slightly more money there are better places in town that don't make you feel like they hate you for coming in while they are open.",

The atmosphere was beautiful and intimate and the space was used well to include the head table, guest tables, the DJ, a bar, food tables and a projector reflecting a lovely slide show of the couple. The food was honestly the best i've ever had at a wedding reception and there was more than enough even with the guests piling enough food on their plates for a small nation! After dinner, the staff inconspicuously removed two tables to create a dance floor that stayed full the rest of the evening. The couple had a very tight budget for their wedding so I suspect the cost of the reception was well below what one would expect. It was truly lovely.",

That being said, I have had some hit or miss experiences with both the food and the service while I have been there. Most recently, I had dinner with my family there to celebrate my graduation for the University of Illinois. We had put in a reservation for our party well in advance and paid a substantial deposit. We showed up slightly early for the reservation and still had to wait almost an hour after the designated time. We were repeatedly told that it wouldn't be much longer, but by the time our party got to the table we were starving and pretty tired of being there. While I recognized that graduation is a very hectic time for people, I just did not understand what the point of making a reservation was when we had to wait as long as people who walked in the door. Once we were seated, the service was a little slow but was much more reasonable. Everyone enjoyed the food, which was flavorful and filling. Our favorite item was some sort of crab hushpuppies that were simply phenomenal. However, on other occasions, I have ordered fish dishes and found them to be somewhat bland. Overall, this place is a nice place to eat if you're looking for somewhere with a fancy vibe in Urbana. However, I would steer clear of it for important events (parents weekends, graduation, homecoming and other peak times) and check the menu before you go to ensure that the food suits your tastes.",

They serve warm bread with the meal, which is always a good start.I had the filet and it was soo good, and we shared a couple desserts for dessert and I would recommend each on - creme brule, bread budding, and a torte.It was so good we went for their Sunday brunch.  It's $20.95 and worth every penny!  When can you get salmon, prime rib, fresh waffles, red velvet cake for $20!  It also comes with drinks included (I had juice and coffee).They also have an awesome beer and wine selection - much better than your typical restaurant.I would seriously recommend this place!",

                "review": "The food was good, but it doesn't outweigh the management practices. The experience was bordering on a nightmare. Definitely a stressful and extremely unpleasant dream.Graduation day at U of I. Reservations were made far in advance. We had a 9pm reservation with a $50 required deposit. When we walked in a few minutes before 9, we found ourselves shoulder to shoulder with angry and annoyed patrons. We spoke to several people who had been waiting to be seated 1, 2, and even 2 and a half hours AFTER their reservation time. They know how to take a reservation, just not how to keep the reservation. And that's really the most important part of the reservation.So, due to the $50 required credit card deposit, all those people were stuck waiting and waiting and waiting. After waiting an hour, we asked what would happen if we left, and they said they would charge us $50. I'm pretty sure this wouldn't hold up in a court of law, but the small claims filing fee is more than $50 so they have people hooked. When we were finally seated an hour and a half after our \"reservation\" time, the 5 of us were squished into a small booth with a chair at the end. There was no space for that chair. It was very uncomfortable. Were our drinks comped? Were we offered anything for our long wait? No. The server was very nice, but we were starved and exhausted and really annoyed. The food was great, but way overpriced. I had \"little parcels\" pasta filled with cheese. Really great. The taste was worth 5 stars. I find management's policy on the U of I graduation date coupled with their failure to keep reservations absolutely unacceptable. It is completely unnecessary, their restaurant would be packed skipped reservations or not. The management decided to take this opportunity to swindle people.",

There is also a fabulous dessert selection for those with more of a sweet tooth. The servers are quick to refill a drink or pick up an empty plate and were more than kind and tolerant of our group which was frequently moving around and staging photos in the middle of a booming time slot.

The restaurant's ambience is just about perfect, with romantic lighting and a beautiful garden room that's just breathtaking (more on that in a minute).There are some complaints on here about the food, but I think it's delicious.  I haven't had anything here I didn't like.  One of my favorites is a salad, whose name escapes me at the moment, made with field greens, goat cheese, toasted walnuts, dried cherries, and a champagne vinaigrette dressing.  It's simply divine; I could be happy with just that.  However, it just keeps getting better.  I think the chefs are pretty creative, although the menu hasn't changed much in the three years I've lived here.  The desserts are excellent, as is the wine selection.I've heard that brunch is fabulous, but we've only been for lunch once and dinner a handful of times.  They put on quite a show for New Year's Eve, with a special menu and a generally festive atmosphere.  It was New Year's Eve 2004 that my sweetie and I were sitting in that gorgeous garden room, enjoying a night out on the town, when all of a sudden, a diamond ring was staring me in the face, and my sweetie was down on one knee asking me to marry him.  Now, Silvercreek isn't directly responsible for one of the happiest nights of my life, but they certainly helped make it as perfect as it was, and for that, I thank them.",

Definitely not worth $20. Pretty good food but not $20 a person food and experience overall.",

The selection is smaller than what you would get at other buffets, but the quality of the food blows all the others away. I would say that it even rivals other non-buffet restaurants in terms of the quality of the food. I liked their prime ribs and croissants, they were very fresh, a new batch being brought out once every fifteen minutes. The ribs were flavorful and not under or overcooked in my opinion. Some people may find some of the slices of meat to be too undercooked, but there are plenty to choose from. One thing that was kind of disappointing is the selection of fruits. There was plenty of meats, vegetables, and baked goods to choose from, but I found the selection of fruits kind of lacking. Their website showed a whole platter of fruits with various melons berries, etc, but there was only a bucket of oranges and lemons (yes whole lemons) that you had to peel yourself. I would expect pictures to be slightly exaggerated, but this is a little too much. Even cheap buffets like Ichiban Chinese Buffet or Hometown will have slices of ready to eat fruit. Just that felt like a glaring hole, considering the price and the otherwise great food and service.The service is definitely above average and my water was refilled often, and the waiter was prompt at taking my used plates. I felt comfortable eating at Silvercreek, with the restaurant being clean and the friendly staff. Overall a really nice restaurant, but one star off for the lack of fruits and higher price.",

The space is still lovely.  I thought the food quite good until maybe the late 90's.  Several chefs have come and gone recently (last few years).  I have had lunch/dinner here a few times over the last, say, 6 months, and it has been decent.  Nothing too stellar, but not horrible.  The menu gets tweaked more frequently.  HOWEVER - today I stopped by for brunch at about 12:40, it is scheduled to go until 2:30.  Brunch at the Silvercreek of old was very good - lots of salad and hot items, bustling crowd.  It wasn't too crowded, but I was saddened at the brunch I saw.  VERY limited salad items (though the dressing was good).  Mostly very standard breakfast fare, except that the scrambled eggs were somewhat brown (not from brown eggs, either).  Very few hot items, either - some brisket, the kind you would put on a bun, fried chicken (boring), and some salty, rapidly cooling prime rib and ham.  Desserts were unmemorable as well, including a key lime pie that had so much green food coloring in it that I wondered if one of the ingredients was green food coloring.  The trifle I had and the cheesecake were lackluster.  To top it off, I saw my server three times - once for my inital drink, once to clear plates, and once for the bill (which was wrong, I was charged for 2 buffets!) .  Never asked how things were - breezy and unprofessional.  Come on Silvercreek, there are too many other good brunch choices in town, including Luna and Jim Gould (best brunch in town as far as I am concerned, though I don't think they do other meals well).  I think the owner is too busy with his car collection to oversee his eating establishments.  I have not been very impressed with the Courier lately, either (same owner).",

The hot table included two types of scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, vegetable, two types of potatoes (the sweet potatoes au gratin were outstanding), fried chicken, salmon and a carving station with both ham and prime rib.  I always enjoy a nice piece of prime rib with horseradish cream sauce.  The dessert bar had a nice selection too, including a hot chocolate bread pudding that was absolutely decadent.",

It is beautiful, and it was also  the first smoke-free restaurant in town. I very much appreciated that at the time. The food wants to be outstanding, but it is only very good. For as much as this place costs, I want it to be better. More innovative, more spectacular. The wait staff is mostly very young and not quite experienced enough to pull off the fine dining experience. One time, one of them addressed my dining companion as \"dude.\" He took offense, and rightly so. We are not your surfin' buddies, we are your customers. That said, this is a great place for a big celebratory dinner with your whole family. It's a beautiful setting, the wine and beer lists are good, and your grandmother will be able to find something she wants to eat. So will your vegetarian cousin and her picky five-year-old, and so will you.",

Sunday = 1/2 price wine night (per glass) which was surprising as their wine isn't unreasonably priced to begin with (~ $5-$9), and they have a nice selection to choose from.We split their goat cheese salad, I ordered their stuffed chicken breast, and my friend got their 5-spiced alaskan halibut (which I tried a bite of).  We both agreed that the chicken was really yummy and juicy, anwhile their halibut was well cooked and moist, I found it a bit tasteless (plus a on the more expensive for what you got).The ambiance is quite romantic (both inside and out), but you don't need to dress up unless you want (I was just in shorts, a tee, and a fleece), and it's just a nice place for a quiet dinner.I'm going between 3 and 4 stars here, but I until I try their brunch, I'll have to say 3.",

I started off with the Roasted Squash Panzaella which is a crouton salad, and it was very good. There were too many croutons in it for me, but I just picked out some of them and ate the rest. For the entree, I got the Crispy Potato Crusted Michigan Whitefish. It was so good. I loved every bite. By the time I got to the end,  I was glad that I had not eaten all of the croutons in the appetizer.For dessert, I got the Apple Dumpling A La Mode and again it was amazing. It was on the small side, but I thought it was the perfect size for me. Someone else may be disappointed that it wasn't bigger but any bigger and I would not have been able to eat it all.All in all, I was very happy with my experience and if I am ever in town again, I will definitely go back.",

The service is good, although knowledge of the wine list could be better (from both servers so far). The menu is really interesting, with a lot of options, and some cool creative twists on some meals which would otherwise be your typical American bistro fare. Prices are worth it, HUGE portions (generally speaking-but the pork chop especially is Massive and the Hangar steak notsomuch).I fully intend on going back, frequently.",

It is quite an extravagant lunch with MANY options, and they were constantly refilling the trays so everything was fresh!  The waffles were fantastic, light and fluffy, the salads were fresh, and the hot items were flavorful.  I was struck, as a vegetarian, with how many green vegetable options I had!  Brussels sprouts, broccoli, zucchini with cherry tomatoes, spinach salad, cucumber salad!  For meat eaters, there were all sorts of coldcuts, fish and seafood, fried chicken, beef and ham.  And save room for dessert, there are almost as many dessert items available as there are main course, so many cakes!  Along with tarts, candy, apple crisp, bread pudding (which wasn't very good, the only thing I didn't like at all), trifle and fruit.  This is the perfect place to bring visiting family or have a nice brunch out with friends.  Service for us was good, though I did have a bit of a wait once for a water refill.

Based on the good reviews and seemingly more upscale menu, I thought this would be a nicer restaurant with good decor and great food. Well, not so much. My friend and I showed up around 7:30 on a Friday night and the place was only about half full. That should have been our first hint. The restaurant has a rather strange look what with the exposed brick and ceiling beams combined with the country-style tables, carpet, and booths. Overall, it just looked a little dated and old, especially the booths that were in a bit of disrepair. The dinner menu isn't huge and has a handful of selections for seafood, steaks, and pasta. I opted for the potato-crusted whitefish. It came with a cream sauce, asparagus, mushrooms, and carrots. It came out nicely presented, but when I lifted up the outer potato crust and got a glimpse of the actual fish I was so annoyed. I'm not exaggerating in the slightest when I say that piece of fish was 2x2 inches. Maybe you're not supposed to notice that with all the potato lumped on top of it, but at $18 that was absolutely ridiculous. My friend said her lobster mac and cheese was good, but so rich she could only eat half. And, BTW, it was corkscrew pasta, not macaroni.Sadly, I didn't order a salad because those actually looked pretty good. And there was also a good looking maple banana cake, but I refused to spend any more money there so I can't attest to the desserts. Overall, this place is way, way overpriced and I would never go back.",

Gremolata ( overpowering and chemical flavor) on over-cooked scallops, undercooked fingerling potatoes and a passable steak with uninspired brown sauce poured over. Overall, quite \"ok\" but no better. Highlight was the dessert, a chocolate cake with ganache and mousse. Best part of the meal was feeling welcome to linger and chat, which we certainly did.",

It's a family restaurant with half food service frozen stuff and half solid homemade stuff. You need to enlist your waiter or a local to sift through what's worth ordering. Decent salad bar and soup. Probably could get away without ordering an entree. If you've been to a greek owned family restaurant in the Chicago area, then you can kinda picture what its like here. Overall,  I'd come back, but it's nothing incredible.",

The menu has a huge selection - something for everyone (unless you're eating vegan of course). There were about 8 of us and they had plenty of tables but for some reason, we had to wait 15 minutes for a table. When one of us asked if we could sit at the empty ones, they said sure if we didn't mind being split up, which we agreed to. When we were about to be seated, they asked if we wanted the tables pushed together (all of us were wondering why they didn't just do that earlier) but we said no, it's fine to keep them separate. All the food had that fake butter country crock flavor and the toast had huge slabs of margarine on them. Also, one of our waitress was considerably faster than the other which made our experience a little more strange since we were already split up at two tables.All in all, this place was one of those places that's so bad it's kinda good and when you're hungover, I'd choose this place over Merry Ann's any day.",

If you like a cheap meal or breakfast item this is likely the place to go. Also if you are eligible for a senior citizen discount, this is a great place to grab a meal. For everyone else, there is so much left to be desired. I don't care about the drab interior that reminds you of a restaurant from the 80s. If the food is good I am there. The prices are cheap for dinner and they have multiple specials everyday of the week. Today was 11.99 all you can eat bbq ribs or pasta. I took at pass an tried the grilled salmon for 12.99. A couple issues came up. First there is no warm bread with butter, you get a trough of saltine crackers so this is clearly wrong in the menu. Second you can chose soup or salad, I went with the soup based on the other reviews. The beef vegetable had a lot of veggies, but no pieces of beef another thumbs down. Finally the meal itself came without any other fixins instead a slice of tomato and lettuce. I have no idea how that goes with salmon. A couple of steamed veggies would have paired nicely. Salmon was okay, nothing special that you couldn't whip up at home. Finally that amazing pie that people wrote about, if you look carefully at the shelf, those are store bought pies. All and all this is a place for 10 dollar ish meal, but I think I might have been better off eating at a fast food restaurant. Pro: cheap breakfast/lunch/dinner, daily specials, seniors discountCons: store brought pies, no fresh bread with butter which is in the menu, borderline poor-below average mealsHidden gem:Daily specials. Check the website, although it does not appear to be updated and constantly shows a Monday special",

All their pies (especially the pecan) is like awesomeness in your mouth4.  The breakfast omelettes are a frown... which is so unfortunate because I can never find a unbusy good brunch place.

We always use yelp when trying to find a good restaurant in a new location - and when yelp gave us this restaurant as the #1 in the area, we were doubtful it would be right for us.  It looks like your typical family greasy spoon but we decided to try it because of the yelp reviews & we were hungry.  This is the only restaurant in the vicinity of at least 5 hotels but we quickly realized why.  The food came out in what seemed like 5 minutes and everything was fantastic.  My reuban came with a bowl of soup - chicken rosemary - huge chunks of real chicken breast and perfect flavor.  The salad bar was very fresh and had a nice variety of choices - you can order the salad bar instead of the fries but the fries are nice steak versions - which usually are served uncooked in the middle because they are too thick.  Not here - every one was perfect...and we all ate every one.  The service staff was very nice & friendly.So we went back for breakfast the next morning.  Again, everything tasted great and we had wonderful service and the prices cannot be beat.I would give this restaurant 5 stars but both times we were there, there were kids whining in the back ground.  Not the restaurants fault but it is a family style restaurant and as long as you can put up with a whining kid the whole time you are there, then this is the #1 choice in the area.",

But this review is based on more recent visits. :-)It can get busy on Sundays after churches typically get out. But, for the most part, there is not a long wait. One one recent occasion I had brunch with my mom and a family friend. I ordered a salad. It was HUGE. I actually had to take half of it to go! On the second recent trip, we went out as a family for Mother's Day. No wait late in the afternoon. I ordered the banana blueberry pancakes. They were supposed to be multigrain, but learned that they had discontinued the multigrain batter the week before. :-(  But the waitress said that they could make them with regular batter. I was surprosed that the bananas were not baked in the pancake, rather they were sliced on top. Regardless, the pancakes were still good. They have sugar free syrup if that is your preference and it wasn't bad. They let me alter my order no problem. It was supposed to come with turkey sausage and egg whites. But I changed it to fruit and bacon. No extra charge.Speed of service and attentiveness dependent upon who you get and the time of day. But I haven't had a negative experience. Pay your tab at the front register, not at the table.",

The lady that rung me up was so friendly and reassured me the pie would be great. It turns out we had a hit item at the picnic we went to. Everyone kept talking about the pie as we were making our way through the savory main dishes. And boy did it disappear fast. The pie was just as delicious as Marie's.

They serve \"mammoth muffins\" for around $2.30.  They had the typical kinds like Banana Nut, but also Cranberry Nut and Carrot, which I really wanted to try but I couldn't imagine that cream cheese frosting sitting too well at 8am.  Another time.Their muffins are big... I guess \"mammoth\" sized, but instead of an insanely gigantic muffin all I can picture is an adorable woolly mammoth.  Anyways, I thought the muffin was cream-filled, but it came with a mini scoop of butter on the side.  Not the same, and I didn't slab it on.  It tasted great the way it was.  With a cup of coffee my breakfast was within $5.By the way their pies and cookies are amazing, especially their FRENCH SILK pie.  All I've had here are their desserts and that is fine by me!",

Not downright bad, definitely not particularly good.I got an omelet with pepper jack cheese and the \"garden mix\" (green peppers, onions, and celery).  It came with homefries and 3 pancakes.  All for just under $9.  Not a bad price considering the ridiculous amount of food you get, but I don't really NEED that much food, and it wasn't very good food.The pancakes were pretty good; I had them with the wild berry sauce, since I can't stand that fake \"maple\" syrup that restaurants serve--so kudos to them for offering 3 different syrup choices for pancakes (maple syrup, wild berry syrup, and peach syrup).  The hashbrowns were also decent.  My omelet was pretty nasty and I ended up just eating half of it.  The pepper jack cheese tasted cheap and bland and the peppers onions and celery (....still a bit baffled by the inclusion of celery) was just not a great combo.  Kind of annoyed that cheese counts toward one of the \"free\" toppings in the \"create your own omelet\"...shouldn't an omelet just...COME with cheese?I had a few sips of my boyfriend's coffee and it tasted pretty good.Service was average, and we got our food fairly quickly.The bill for the 2 of us came to about $22 (before tip).  We spent a couple bucks less at Courier Cafe last weekend, for better food and a more interesting atmosphere.  Definitely will be going back to Courier Cafe, not so sure about Perkins.",

The food was good and hit the spot. The problems came after we got our food. Our waitress disappeared. I'm not sure if she was taking a break or busy doing other tasks but she was nowhere to be found. We were wanting to order dessert which is one of the perks of going to Perkins as they have good pie and other goodies. Unfortunately we have had this type of service in the past. We did inform the manager about our disappearing waitress.Another problem I have with the staff is that if you order a muffin with your meal, don't expect to get dessert. The waiter/waitress will suggest that you 'probably don't want dessert' since you had a muffin. This has happened to us on multiple visits from multiple waitresses. I'm not sure if this is how they train their staff here, but it's really not a good way to run a business. I want to give them my money for more food and tip well, but they make it very difficult to do this.I don't care if you have the best food on the planet. If your service is lousy, then it ruins the whole experience.",

I've experienced better\" and three stars jumps to \"A-OK.\"  Perkins is somewhere in between.  The menu for breakfast seems pretty extensive.  I ordered a platter that included smoked sausage (greasy), sausage (greasy and bland), eggs (done okay), bacon (spot on), breakfast potatoes (pretty good), and pancakes (so-so).  I like that they leave a pot of coffee on the table, rather than having you wait for refills from the wait staff.  It would have been even better if the pot was full and the coffee was good, neither of which was the case.  My waitress was efficient and personable.  Seemed more like a pro waitress rather than some of these student types that serve with the attitude that says, \"I'm only doing this until I graduate and start my money-making career, so don't expect much.\"  Again, not all student wait staff are like that but some are.  The place seemed clean and it wasn't very busy for a Saturday morning breakfast.  I've wanted to try Perkins and must admit i went there today only because Courier Cafe was closed.  I will return to Perkins, as there were some other things on the menu I'd like to try and because the experience wasn't completely a bust.  Although, I am usually a member of the Clean Plate Club, I did leave behind one piece of smoked sausage, a sausage link, some potatoes, and half the pancakes.  That says something.SECOND VISIT: My first reaction holds true the second time.  The coffee wasn't very good.  The eggs were okay and the potatoes decent.  Bacon once again was perfect.  The muffin french toast was awful. and was left unfinished.",

I tried one of their newer omelets, and it was surprisingly tasty.  I had that problem where I was too full to eat more but wanted to keep eating...  The service, however, leaves much to be desired.The first time I went was on a Sunday around noon, so it was pretty busy.  My boyfriend and I stood in front of the podium waiting for someone to come to put our names on the list.  When someone finally came, he first took the name of someone who had come in after us, like we weren't even there.  It took a while to be seated, but that's understandable since it was about time for Sunday brunch.The second time was again on a Sunday around noon, but it wasn't near as busy.  Our waitress took our orders promptly, but afterwards, the quality of service plummeted.  My water glass was empty for at least 15 minutes before getting a refill, twice.  The waitress had walked past our table many times, but didn't even look at us to see how we were doing.  Our food took forever to come, and I understand there were five of us so that can take a while, but this was ridiculous.  And the waitress didn't say a thing the whole time.  When the food did come, it was warm, so at least the meal itself was good.  I asked for a box, but it never came.  I ended up asking for one at the counter myself to avoid waiting probably another half hour.  Overall, our waitress stopped at our table maybe five times total, and never apologized for the long wait or even noticed that we were pretty upset with our service.  In addition, several of the other employees were arguing loudly in earshot of customers, which I think is pretty unprofessional.I can't say I'd recommend going here, and if you do, expect to wait.",

This place does not offer vegetarian-friendly lunch options. I ended up getting the tomato basil soup and the wedge salad without the bacon. Both were subpar.2. The service staff showed little effort. After my waitress carelessly placed the water on my table, she just threw my straw in front of me and hurriedly proceeded to serve the neighboring table. Wow. What's more is that my wedge salad was hastily assembled--the iceberg lettuce was stacked in chunks and the bleu cheese was piled on one side. 3. The booth I sat at was not well-cleaned, and the table was sticky. How the heck this happened is beyond me.The only thing holding me back from giving them 1 star is that their pastries at the front counter look well made. Sorry, Perkins. You're never seeing me again.",

I ordered the new bacon, mushroom and onion skillet and I loved it. It has an Alfredo sauce over potatoes, grilled mushrooms & onion, bacon and cheddar cheese. I know it sounds like a heart attack on a plate but it was so good. I had a blueberry muffin also and it came out hot with butter on the side. Although I was very pleased with the meal the reason I am giving such a low rating is for the service. I ran out of water and was looking for my waitress to ask for more. It took a really long time for her to show up again. It also took more than a half an hour for our food to come out of the kitchen after we ordered. With only an hour for lunch that is unacceptable.",

When the ice had brought down all the electrical, once, and the roads were sheets of ice, a death-defying trek to Perkins, who promptly saved Christmas, one year!Whenever we couldn't make up our mind about anywhere else, the answer was always Perkins, and this location (on University) always met the call.  A warm pancake stack, with an ice cream scoop sized wad of butter melting in!  The aforementioned French Silk pie, a slice of it just as a treat.  Even their hot turkey plate-- a real Butterball turkey, slow cooked, with amazing \"fixin's\".  I mean... food doesn't have to be froo froo for me in order to be _good_, _wholesome_, and made with love.  So many meals I've had here, and I'd say that the vast majority of them have been something special!Perkins is super reasonable on price.  The restaurant is a little dated, now, but you just _can't_ judge this book by its cover.

I had a Flat Iron Steak and fingerling potatoes w/blue cheese. Steak was cooked perfectly. Potatoes were tasty.Other people in our group were satisfied with their choices. (We tasted each other's dishes to verify the deliciousness.) Portabella burger, veggie burger, American Kobe burger, chipotle shrimp skewers, & chorizo stuffed dates wrapped in bacon were their choices. We had two appetizers - cheese curds & tempura-fried asparagus. Yum, yum.One of our dessertw was the highly-promoted banana cream pie. Good, but the bananas were over caramelized. (waiter apologized).All in all we were very happy with our experience. I hope to take other people to share the Destihl experience.",

Also really enjoy their coffee and fresh cream after any meal there. Still nothing terribly interesting however everything seems fresh and well executed. Also I am trying to tone down on being such a food snob so... 4 stars!! (throws confetti sarcastically)",

My group of 12 was immediately seated and drink orders were quickly taken. Service was interesting. Although our waiter was excellent, there seemed to be several uncertainties when drinks and food were brought to the table. Things got to where they needed to be, but I was surprised there seemed to be so much trouble just getting the orders to the correct guests.The food was wonderful! We had some excellent shared appetizers -- beer-battered asparagus, stone oven pretzels and beer-battered bacon. I had the Greekish salad and the cedar plank salmon. My wife had bacon & brussels and roasted beet salad. Others had a variety of chicken, seafood and meat entrees. For dessert my wife and I shared the chocolate cake.I tried a few of the four ounce beer samples and had a bloody mary. The beer was very good, the bloody mary excellent in presentation but only average in taste.We were not expecting to spend almost three hours having a leisurely dinner, but the evening was very nice. I was impressed with the general vibe for a Saturday night.All in all, I was impressed with Destihl and will definitely come back to try lunch or perhaps dinner with my wife or a smaller group.",

The restaurant decor is very modern and the menu is impressive - often offering delectable-sounding dishes and impressive combinations. That said, you may be disappointed upon arrival of your meal. The presentation is beautiful, but the taste is so bland. The first time I had a featured soup and sandwich - both just okay. The second time, I had their Rancher burger, which was wayyy overcooked (I asked for medium-rare and got very well done) and the fries were pretty bland. Some words about leftovers from Destihl: you don't want them. They are terrible as next-day meals. Overall, you'll have better luck for your taste buds and wallet by making a trip down the street to Dublin's.",

I don't have very much in the way of complaints about Destihl, but I don't exactly have much that makes me love the place either, especially since it is downtown and it has a lot of competition in the restaurant scene that does a better job. Let's start with the beer. To me, being a \"brewpub\", the quality of the beer is pretty sub par. I've had some good brews, but definitely some bad ones. I was here just last week and got a red ale that tasted more or less like fizzy cough syrup. Not the total end of the world, and beer taste is very subjective, but the beer here isn't exactly cheap and I feel like it's one of their main draws as a brewpub. On the other hand, I don't think I've ever had a bad experience with the food. They have great pizzas with a pretty neat variety of toppings and some pretty killer appetizers, the thai wings and the pretzels are a pretty normal addition to my dinners here. They will consistently cook a cheeseburger medium rare (sad that's something I have to even say) and the other entrees are usually pretty quality. They have a number of specials usually every week too. All in all, this place is certainly not bad, and I would feel a little more comfortable with giving it a 3.5 instead of a 3, but I would rather round down than up. If you haven't visited I definitely would check it out but after you've been here a couple of times I don't think you will get excited to go back.",

                "review": "I have never been more disappointed in my gastronomic experience in Urbana-Champaign then this past weekend at Destihl \"Brewery\" (who knows if they even brew beer at this place). Having been to Destihl a handful of times before the abominable brunch I suffered through this past weekend I expected an experience somewhat similar to what most people describe here on Yelp. That being a friendly staff, and decent (perhaps even good) food at reasonable prices. Unfortunately, Destihl has suffered a complete drain of quality over the last few years. When it opened, Destihl offered hot, quality food served my intellectual and friendly servers who were happy to be working in one of Champaign's better restaurants. Each time I dined at Destihl I noticed the quality of the food, the quality of the service, and the quality of the dining experience was eroding away. This erosion culminated with the brunch a group of friends and I endured this past Sunday. I say endured because our meal lasted from 12:30p.m. until 2p.m. The absurd elongation of our meal was not caused by entrancing, deep conversation amongst old friends, or by laggard mastication of our fantastic food. The epoch that was our brunch at Destihl was caused solely by the complete ineptitude and incompetence of our server, the manager, and Destihl as an establishment. To begin, our waiter spoke to our group at a volume slightly above \"whisper\". He seemed to not care at all that our decently sized group would likely give him his biggest tip of the day. One could almost assume our waiter was indentured to Destihl and taking our orders, suggesting menu items, and assuring that we were taken care of was a reminder of the chains that confined him. After taking our orders, three of which were simply \"eggs, bacon, and potatoes\" (not worth the $10), our group set off on the marathon that ninety minutes later would end in us getting our food. In total our group would watch at least seven other parties wait for a table, be placed near us, taken care of by the same subjugated waiter, eat, pay their bill, and depart. After the fourth group who had arrived after us was served before us, a member of our group called the manager over. At this point we had spent 45 minutes ordering and waiting. By this point the waiter had been unable to provide any information about our meal besides, \"they are still working on it, should be out soon.\" This information was decrypted by the members of our group through the reading of his lips and not by any sort of audible understanding between him and ourselves. We hoped the manger could provide us with additional information, this would prove to be a fool hearted assumption.The manager assured us he would check on our order and would return shortly. After three more groups consumed their meals, paid their tabs and departed, and another half an hour passed, the manager had not returned. At this point our group decided that if our food did not arrive by 1:45 PM. we would simply stand up, leave, and eat fast food. Finally, at 1:43p.m., 1 hour 13 minutes after arriving our meal was served. Destihl was relatively empty when we arrived and continued to be throughout our meal. Yet, our food took longer to cook than the run time of the original 1931 version of Frankenstein. If you have been to Destihl for brunch you know none of the menu items are difficult to cook, they are largely egg dishes accompanied by breakfast meats, french toasts, or a hot sandwich. Since this experience ended I have wondered what took so long for our food to be cooked and leave the kitchen. I have surmised that the reasons for our hour and a half endeavor are a product of the poor quality that now defines Destihl. First, our waiter did not care about us nor did he serve as our representative in the kitchen. Second, the cooks clearly lost track of our order because some food came out steaming hot, some came out only partially complete, and the rest came out lukewarm (presumably having spent an hour under a heat lamp). Finally, the manager who never returned to our table and only after being called over again offered excuse after excuse before finally saying, \"Well, I am sorry.\"To anyone who has invested the time to read my review, thank you. To anyone who has spent the time to read my review and still intends to go to Destihl even after I have made clear my utter frustration and disappointment, I wish you the best of luck. To conclude, my friends and I will never eat at Destihl again and I look forward to the restaurant that will soon replace it.",

We had to flag someone down just for some waters. I wouldn't say the servers did know what they were doing, but just very slow. For a Monday night, business was okay, but waiting 40 minutes for food is inexcusable. I had the Beer Battered Bacon Burger with an Egg, and it was below average. It would have been your average burger if the patty had any flavor.. But the meat was simply tasteless. The beer battered bacon is quite tasty, but the nothing I would crave for. The only reason I give this place two stars is for the Strawberry Ale that I got to try. The beer was light and smooth, it complimented my meal. I would go back to have a drink or two, but not for a dinner out with family or friends.",

This was the first time someone had even acknowleged us.  we ordered beers and the waited another 20 minutes for the first round to arrive at our table.  50 minutes after walking in we finally had a drink!  At a bar no less! We were celebrating a birthday and would have ordered more rounds of drinks if we could have.  we saw the server 3-5 times total and only were able to order 2 beers.  My hamburger was raw and an individual kids pizza was terrible.  The topping just slid off of the crust.  Very sad we chose this option.",

There is also plenty of seating.For appetizers, we ordered the cheese curds, pretzel, and lamb meatballs. The cheese curds were amazing, basically just fried cheese with marinara sauce. The pretzel was also good - a little burnt in places but nothing too aggravating. It came with nacho cheese and mustard. Our server had the chef chop it up into bite size so we could share easily. Very thoughtful. For my lunch entree, I ordered the Dijon chicken. It came with two asparagus and mashed sweet potatoes with sausage chopped up in it. for about $10, i would order this over and over again. It truly felt like a hearty, but healthy lunch option, especially relative to other options on the menu. The price cannot be beat.",

                "review": "Overall, not impressed. My family decided to something a bit different this year and went to a new restaurant vs. going to old standbys. After finding a list of top restaurants online, we ended up settling on Destihl due to the large menu with seemingly lots of tasty options.We made a reservation for a Monday night and we were seated right away. Parking can be a bit difficult mid-evening. We had to circle around the nearby city lot to finally find a spot. My order: Chorizo stuffed dates to share and Thai steak salad.Other orders: Clam chowder (the soup of the day), House salad, Spicy Thai shrimp, and Pesto Chicken (recommended by the waiter).The dates came out first. I didn't realize they were going to be wrapped in bacon. But score, I love it that way. The bacon needed to be cooked a bit more though. They had a nice kick to them. They were enjoyed for the most part, but these are much better in Atlanta.As for main meal, the accidentally brought my mom a Caesar salad instead of the House salad. She was going to order it but changed her mind. The waiter forgot to write down the change. He came out quickly to apologize after it was delivered. The salad is a wedge salad with a crispy toast in place of croutons and a fried egg. My mom wasn't excited about the fried egg and gave it to us. I tasted it but didn't like it so passed it on to my brother. How do you mess up a fried egg?My Thai steak salad was not very good. The steak was cooked more medium than medium well. There was not much of it. The greens were kinda soggy. The peanuts were way too salty. Much better in Atlanta, again.Overall, portion sizes were adequate and we got our fill. We signed up for a rewards card that evening and were able to apply the purchase that we had just made to our rewards card. That was great. Even though I may not be back. There were plenty of other options that seemed great on the menu, but hesitant after this experience. Plus there are other places to try in the city.Everyone else liked their food. So that's something. I was going to give them 3 stars given everyone else's satisfaction. But then I realized that I had noted in our reservation that we were celebrating my dad's birthday. They didn't do anything to signify that. Not even a happy birthday. Nothing! So 2 stars it is.",

Like so good hat he went there for lunch and dinner one day and then came back for brunch the next morning. After looking at the menu, how could I resist??So we went today for a late lunch (around 2:30) and found the place pretty much deserted. There were some people working in the bar who made eye contact with us but didn't come up to the host stand to seat us. So we waited. And waited. And finally a hostess came and brought us to a cavernous booth in the bar. Where we waited. And waited. And listened to awful terrible music (read: Dave Matthews Band)A female server came to get our drink orders and informed us that Michael would be our server. Ok, so the do team service, I'm on board with that. But Michael didn't come with our drinks. Someone dressed like a manager did. And Michael didn't take our food order. A woman who we later learned was a manager did. I think Michael maybe refilled our drinks? The first manager looking guy dropped off our apps. Here's the skinny on what we had:Beer battered bacon: this is worth a star. It was greasy but oddly delicious. Brussels sprouts: flavor was good but they were still pretty hard in the middle. Bacon Egg and Cheese Deviled Eggs: nothing to write home about. They were small and pretty smoky tasting.  For entrees, I ordered the fried egg BLT and my sister ordered the bison burger. My BLT was fine. Again, nothing to write home about. There was some sort of mustardy vinaigrette on the greens that was overpowering. And the egg could have been runnier. But another star goes to the fries which were hot and crispy and delicious. My sister ordered her burger medium and it came out completely well done. Like \"we think this bison is dead but let's burn it at the stake just to make sure it's really really dead.\" She decided to send it back and so we waited. And waited. And a brand new server (still not Michael) came by to check on us. She went back to the kitchen to have them make a new burger and left the old one so my sis could nibble on the fries. Her friendly attitude and apologies would have garnered another star, but I was SO put off when she came back to tell us that her manager wanted to let us know that she put the order in correctly and that the cooks are the ones who screwed up. Umm... Why wouldn't the manager come over herself to apologize? Or at least to check on us after the replacement came? And also, it is so not cool to throw your kitchen staff under the bus like that. All in all, Destihl has good bacon, inattentive staff, poor leadership, and too much desire to be \"cool.\" And where is Michael? My receipt says he was my server but I don't even know if I saw him, and I fear my tip went to someone who didn't do any work! I won't be back.",

Omg, I just realized that delish is almost an anagram for Destihl.  So shall I say it was delisht*?Too many other things were off about the meal for me to want to return.  Too bad because those desserts sound alluring (pumpkin bread pudding!).- It took way too long for the waiter (who said he was new) to come back for our order.  Another waitress actually came by to ask how we were doing because she saw us looking around. - Long wait for the appetizers.  How long does it take to send over some cheese curds, bacon wrapped dates, and nachos?  The nachos arrived last.  I didn't time it, but the meal was a solid hour and 45 minutes.  I wasn't crazy about the nachos, but the cheese curds were my second fave after the dates.- My bison burger was extra dry (and I've had juicy bison before), and the bun it came on was too crumbly and dry as well.  I took 2 bites and ditched the rest of the bun.And the last and final straw:- My colleague clearly ordered the Carolina pork two ways (the entree is actually like 5 or 6 words on the menu, and he read off every word), but what was served to him was the Carolina wings.  He ended up just eating it because it would've taken forever for the correct entree to come out, based on our experience with the apps and entrees.  Also, rather than bringing out a free dessert or comp'ing the entree off the bill, we were still charged for the incorrect order, and waiter just kept saying thanks for understanding, and \"the wings tasting good?\"  That is actually the first time in life that I've seen an entree get messed up, and it's still charged on the final bill.  Wth?  I spoke to a manager, who removed the item from the bill.*the t is silent.  Duh!",

I also have a baby and a stroller and the host was great about getting her a high chair before we even asked, and was very chill about finding a place for the stroller and just having the baby around in general. The food was delicious. I had a Thai steak salad, and the steak came on its own next to the salad so you can cut it yourself and get the full delicious steak experience and not lose any juiciness. The steak was tender and cooked wonderfully, and the salad was nicely spicy, with some spicy peanuts that I think they make in-house. Good deal for $12, in my opinion, or at least not overpriced compared to restaurants with similar food. My husband had the fish and chips, which I thought were pretty nice too. Potato wedges were a bit salty, but I love salt, so I was happy. Beer-wise, I had a house IPA that was good but not great. Would go again for a nice meal out. It seems like a good place to go on a date or celebrate an event, and they seem to handle large groups well.",

I was kind of put off by the dark color of the sauce, but the whole entree was pretty good; chicken was flavorful and tender too. For dessert I had the baked apples, which was good but nothing unique. Our waitress was very attentive, but  her attentiveness seemed to taper off as the night went on.",

They have few of the best appetizers I have had and certainly the best in the urbana-champaign area. They profess their best appetizer are the cheese curds (which are good) but the best of the lot has to be the Potato croquettes. I have had the beer-battered asparagus as well which changed my taste buds liking towards asparagus! I am a vegetarian and its extremely difficult to find a good vegetarian burger, so i was skeptical to order that (most places have burnt, bitter black bean patty!!) but they had one of the biggest veggie burger I have seen. The patty had rice, carrots, ginger and a few other veggies blended with the beans making it really delicious filling. The only vegetarian entree they have is the Stuffed Poblano Peppers, which was excellent. The staff is extremely courteous (sometimes more so than needed) and are very keen to entertain you. A few negatives are, the beer selection is great but is limited. I expect a brewery to have all their beers available (except the seasonal's, obviously) but they seem to rotate their beer. Even though the beer tastes good, I would cut some points for the spread of it. Another thing would be the place is unable to substitute any of the meat based dish with a vegetarian option which is a turn off if you are a vegetarian. P.S. Make a reservation, it is usually crowded!",

Their heffeweissen is really excellent. The apricot brew actually tastes like apricot; I tend to like fruity beers, and this one stood out to me. Their cocktails are also really, really good. I had the sake lemon drop and was not disappointed. Appetizers: Hands down, no contest, their beer-battered asparagus takes the gold. Its a lighter batter, more like a very gentle tempura than a \"fried chicken\" type fry. The honey-whatever sauce they serve with it is incredible, and they serve a grilled lemon with it that you probably aren't supposed to eat but tastes like candy so do it anyways. The shrimp ceviche is nothing to write home about. The shrimp skewers entree was tasty and well seasoned, but if you came with a big appetite, it might not be the choice for you. Their portions (one of the things I like most about Desthil) are reasonable and not out of this world for most of the main dishes. My boyfriend wasn't totally full when he left, but comfortable. The thai steak salad is incredible! I like a little spice, and this definitely had that! It's not big, but its delicious. Their pizzas are also fabulous, if a little salty. You can't complain that they underseason like some places in downtown Champaign. The seabass dish (I think it was a special) was definitely worth it. They do their cubans right; their mustard is homemade I think and really rounds it out. Overall, loved it. Decently priced for what you get, and you get a great night out!",

                "review": "This is become one of my favorite places to dine in Champaign. Good prices, consistent cooking, good service, and not too busy on Sunday mornings. I noticed some people complained about the prices, but for the quality of food, this is really much cheaper than something comparable in the Chicago suburbs although the portions aren't exactly huge. But it's pretty in line with prices and portion sizes at other restaurants in downtown. The menu is quite unique for the area and similar to what you'd find in a lot of Milwaukee restaurants.I really enjoyed everything from the American Kobe burger to the Beer-battered cod. The textures and variety of flavors were great and not too salty. The sandwiches and soups were also pretty light and refreshing. I particularly enjoyed the tomato soup and corn & chicken chowder soups. The dessert choices were quite varied but i was so full I didn't have room for more than one. The stout ice cream sandwiches had a really nice stout ice cream between brownie circles. It was a perfect way to end the meal.Given the quality of cooking and good prices, I'll definitely be back here soon.Update: Upon visiting a few more times, I still think this is a good restaurants but there are a couple notes.The price complaints I see from some reviews may be due to the varying sizes of some dishes. For example, the thai mussels appetizer is quite a bit smaller than some other items although the prices are similar. Also, the chocolate cake is a giant portion compared to the bread pudding.I'm not a big fan of anything Asian themed I tried here as I found the flavors to be too strong. I prefer it to be more delicate although some patrons may appreciate the bold flavors. I wasn't a big fan of the pizzas either. They were large in size but the dough was too moist for me and I didn't like the flavor combinations I tried.I did like the teas I tried as they were high quality organic tea bags. The coffee is a mix of two Kenyan coffees with a full bodied flavor from their supplier in Bloomington served with fresh cream. The shrimp frittata comes with a generous amount of shrimp flavored with shrimp stock, probably the best frittata I've ever eaten. The cuban style pork sandwich was done well but not as legendary as other reviewers make it out to be. The Potts roast was also done well but not worth a special note. The potato crusted rainbow trout was done well with good presentation but I wish the portion size could have been a little larger. The dijon chicken was moist and flavored well but, the real star of the dish was the asparagus that was cooked and flavored excellently.The apple fritters dessert had crispy fritters but the toughness of the peel wasn't that appealing. If it were substituted with something like apple chips or churros, I probably would have enjoyed it more. If the goal is to keep an apple-like look, possibly fried colored dough is a better substitute. The chocolate cake is a whole pound with chocolate layering instead of cream. This was done well and not overly sweet, a very good choice for chocolate lovers.  The sour cherry bread pudding was done well, a little too sour for me but a solid choice. I would've preferred a couple elements to vary the texture inside but that might not fit the overall theme of the dish.",

Not only were we waiting 30 minutes, four parties similar in size were seated within 5 minutes.  She was rude and if she were our only interaction with the restaurant, I'd never want to come back.The food was not bad, the ancho chip crusted pork loin was huge and delicious, fish and chips had a great batter on it, both top notch. However, the spicy chipotle chicken sandwiches was well seasoned, but could use a little more substance than just chicken and arugula.  There was too much bread for the sandwich. As for sides, the potato wedges were not bad, french fries were soggy and floppy.Four stars for the food, three for the hostess.",

Maybe it iwas the fact that we checked it out 4 days after it opened, but of the 5 beer styles we got, 4 of them were \"off\".  One was clearly oxidized (badly), one was infected to lacto and tasted very funy and the other two mildly oxidized.  We hoped the manager would come visit with us, but no luck.  The bartender indicated that depending on the time of day, the beer tastes different from the yeast.  First time I have heard of that.  Food was decent, but I have had better pub grub.  Maybe the beer just ruined my taste buds.  (Positive) The pizza is HUGE .  .enough for two to share or one very hungry person.Hopefully they figure things out.  Have been frequently brewpubs throughout the US in the last 12 years and can honestly say it was the oxidized beer and infect beer were the worse I have ever had.  Even my earliest botched homebrews were not that \"off\".  Gave it two stars since it was the first week it was open and the possibilities it was growing pains.",

J tried two different drinks (so I got to try them too) over the course of our dinner, both of which were delicious and pleasantly spiked with liquor.We tried two different apps - the Beer Battered Bacon and the House Olives (our 2nd choice when we were told they'd just run out of the deviled eggs).  The bacon was not greasy at all, and the maple chipotle drizzle was the perfect topper.  The olives were meh, just not necessary - and I don't think my opinion was swayed too much by the fact that I really, really wanted those deviled eggs!Next up, a la carte soup.  I went with the Beer & Cheddar soup, which was close to great with discernible beer and cheese flavors.  J chose the soup du jour, Cream of Asparagus - excellent fresh asparagus flavor here.  Both soups were wonderfully creamy.  Bowls were decent-sized for $5.My entree was a Thai shrimp and noodle dish (I'm a sucker for coconut curry sauces).  Nice amount of shrimp, but no noticeable spice to the dish.  A bit of a disappointment.  J's beer-brined double pork chop was an amazing dish, not to mention huge.  Perfectly pink pork.We parked in a nearby parking garage as the lot across the street was full.  I would return and try everything new (other than my Martini).",

Maybe I just know how to order at a place like this (potato croquettes are great, pretzels are... pretzels - come on, cheese curds are okay, sandwiches are satisfying). I feel like if you're ordering something that you expect to be high-end here, you're just begging to be disappointed. Very good cocktail menu. Nice that they will fill growlers. More than likely there's something on tap you'll like. Good spot to come after work.I always sit at the bar and I usually see people all around who seem happy - that tends to be a good sign in my book.",

It's often the gathering point for business events or company dinners, which brings a lot of patrons to this restaurant. There's a good selection of beer that's, judging by the brewing equipment in the restaurant, presumably brewed in-house (and maybe some off-site) as well as a decent menu showcasing modern American fare.  Usually, a drinking establishment that decides to start cooking ends up making subpar food, while a restaurant that makes good food has a lackluster beer selection. Of course, this isn't always the case, but I usually don't go to bars for their food, and restaurants for their beer. Destihl, however, strikes a good balance between the two camps.  I had a chicken pot pie when I went there, while my dining companion had stuffed peppers. Both were perfectly fine, but nothing to write home about. The menu is made up of conventional American dishes, but unfortunately nothing too unique. You'll find everything you want here for a great meal, but nothing that truly catches your eye.  Overall, the service was excellent, our waiter had insightful knowledge on the beer selections, and the atmosphere here was just right. I feel like their menu is a bit too unoriginal to justify the price, but regardless, I'm sure you'll enjoy your meal here anyways.",

Luckily for me I had not been highly anticipating the opening of Destihl. The beers were good enough. There were about a dozen to choose from so if you drink beer at all, you should be able to find one you like. The night we went in we were given free 2oz samples of as many of the beers  as we wanted to try. I tried the Belgian, Strawberry Blonde and Raspberry Wheat, Champaign Blond and Frankengluten - good flavors, but none will be appearing on my all-time favorites list. The Frankengluten was interesting and worth a try if you are adventurous. Our waiter was nice and attentive enough but could not properly give drink recommendations since he was not old enough to drink. I thought this strange since, clearly, patrons are going to want to know about the beer. The food... I had the brie and portabello sandwich with chips. The chips were average and the sandwich was bland. That's honestly about the best I can say. My dinner partner said his steak salad was excellent and it looked fresh and crisp, but I can't vouch for the taste. We split the beer battered asparagus and that was by far my favorite item. I will probably go back at some point for another try. The pizza and a desserts sounded like they may have potential.Second visit 8/27/11: Finally tried the pizza (pesto and goat cheese) and still really no change in my review. Nice wait staff but the food does not overly impress. You do receive a large quantity of food for the price. Although, for me, quantity does not trump quality.",

I got the pesto chicken pasta which I thought was good, but nothing to get excited about. I tried the fried cheese appertiser, and while good, they also weren't anything to write home about. Overall, food was good, but not great. There are better restaurants elsewhere.The drinks, on the other hand, were good AND also reasonably priced which I did not expect. They had a big beer, wine, cocktail, and martini menu. I tried a couple of different beers, and they were all really good for the most part. They also had 4 oz portion which was a great way to try different beers, and the 4 oz portion is surprisingly not priced proportionally any higher than its 12 oz counter part. Destihl seems like the ideal place to get dinner before a night downtown. Great ambient, great location, great drinks, and good food. Even though it's not anywhere near there yet, I'm sure that it has the potential to be the best place in a couple of months.",

We asked the waitress if there was some mistake but she confirmed that, indeed the bun we received was the \"golden brioche bun\". Either the waitress was mistaken, or this restaurant does not know what a brioche bun is. I guess it's also possible that I have no idea what a brioche bun should look like.

Ideally, I wouldn't have eaten as much as I did, but it was what it was. I started off with some of the home brews. I did the the little 4 oz guys and out of the four I tried, I liked three enough to drink again (the Belgian ale was a bit too hoppy for my liking). At $1.25 each (or $5 for the 4), I don't mind one I didn't like.Next I went with the beer-cheese soup. WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT. It was amazingly good. Also, at my table were some cheese curds and I will dare say that these curds were the finest curds I have ever eaten (and I've had them in Wisconsin too). For my entree, I went with the bison burger which was flavorful - although I will echo the review who noted that their meat was overcooked - and I appreciated that fries were included. The fries were awesome - shoestring style and were not oversalted, but weren't seasoned improperly either (just right!).For dessert it was baked apples with butter pecan ice cream. It was wildly decadent and irresponsibly delicious. The service is not awful but you can tell that the servers are still getting their feet wet. No worries though. The food was totes worth the wait.

Why can't the 4th largest city in the US have a brewpub? I digress.There is a sterile and industrial atmosphere here. One that I am seeing in more in more bars, and I am not a fan. The style does not work here looks like the pub and owners are being cheep.  Seems cold to me. The bar is to the left with some tables and booths. To the right on the Neil St side is another dinning area. The brewing equipment can be seen from the Church St side. A few TV's above the bar, but unintrusive. Relaxed, but sterile and pretty much the exact opposite of the Blind Pig. Which oozes uniqueness from every wood poor.The service is fast, but they are not very interested in much. I want someone working at a brewpub to at least show interest in their products. Here it seems they want to shuffle you in and out with a ticket and some tips. Unimpressed on this front. The food is fairly bland and generic. Some pizzas, some steaks, some chicken, some seafood. A little of everything. They do nothing good, but nothing bad either.There is a wide variety of beers available. Including a cask mild, which I would have jumped at if I had seen it before leaving. The rest is about 14 taps in all styles. A blonde, hefeweizen, a scotch ale, a few stouts and IPAs (some imperial), lots of Belgian styles.  Though nothing is really that good, and some have obvious flaws.Overall, clearly the second best brewpub on the block. Almost the definition of average to me. The food does not really excite me either. I really can't see myself coming here to often over the many other great beer destinations and restaurants within walking distance. Though cheers for at least another brewpub option in town.",

My BF thinks that this is \"a great place for women who shop at Chicos to meet up with each other and discuss the braided leather belts they bought for their husbands.\"  Which is to say, he thinks they overdo atmosphere to keep the rif raff out.  In my experience, I will sacrifice dim lighting for a chile that is actually spicy.  Oh, midwestern restaurants.  Are you using bell peppers to make Chile Rellenos?

For dinner I had the Swordfish dinner. It has a very nice and spicy glaze and is served on a bed of arugula and other spiced veggies. Very impressive, very tasty, but it was a little small which the server told me ahead of time. Not the best choice if you are looking for a big meal, but a very good dish overall. My friend had the Pork rib and pulled pork dish with cole slaw and potatoes. I was very good, had a nice kick to it. Everything is served with a modern flair and a unique flavor profile. This is not your typical boring brew pub food. Very stylish. The atmosphere is nicer that most brew pubs and is great for a nice dinner out with friends. I am never disappointed at Destihl!!",

Tons of good things to say about the place, but I'll start with the two negatives so we can get that out of the way.The waitress heard me say cheese pizza instead of goat cheese pizza.  Probably my fault actually, because it was loud and I am a self-proclaimed mumbler.  This mistake was fixed promptly and the pesto goat cheese pizza was awesome.  Second problem was that the fried asparagus was somewhat whelming.  It was really big, so if you're going for size great, but smaller spears aren't woody textured like the big spears.  I assume that since they specify they use local when they can, that this problem will remedy itself once asparagus comes into season in a few weeks around here.Now for the mega good stuff:Deadhead double red is probably THE BEST red ale I've ever had.  It is strong, spicy, flavorful and full bodied.  Just wonderful!  Everyone at my table liked their other flavors (and we went with some beer snobs ;)  The hubby loved, loved, loved the coffee glazed rib-eye.  Service was surprisingly good granted that it was the first weekend they were open.  The people getting bad service in the other review...sorry, we must've been hogging all the attention ;).  We actually liked the place so much we went back for brunch on the next day.  Which was even. more. amazing.Ordered the swordfish tacos (see pics) and Cuban sandwich, and the french toast (see pics) for the munchkin.  The kids French toast was ridiculously awesome.  Here's the most awesome kicker- we were with a big group with 4 kids and the back room was open, so they gave it to us to have our brunch back there so the kids wouldn't bother anyone else.  It was an awesome experience and the whole staff was soooo super nice.  Make sure to check out my food pics- the kids meal was 1/3 eaten when I took the pic, but you can imagine the thrill in junior's eyes when he saw what he got for breakfast! :)Awesome place guys!  Keep up the good work!",

Fortunately, I was able to get a reservation through OpenTable via Yelp, so getting in was no problem.When we arrived, we were seated within 30 seconds.  I appreciate that efficiency - we also saw several groups that tried the walk-in route - Lesson Learned - use the Yelp reservation system for fast seating!We ordered the home-made chips for an appetizer, and they were great.  Very tasty, and a malt vinegar sauce, as well as a spicy sauce.This place makes and serves it's own beer.  if you want a Bud Light, you'll have to go elsewhere.  If you want to try their beer, the prices are quite honestly, very low for good beer.  We tried their 4 ounce beers (I know, so small, but since you're trying a store brew, do I really want 16 ounces I don't like after one sip?) and for $1 and $1.50 (the price range of a 4 ounce beer), we got 2 beers that were very palatable and very good.On to dinner. The menu ranges from sandwiches to steaks to pizza.I ordered the 8 ounce Sirloin, medium rare.  The steak was cooked properly, more importantly, it was seasoned properly, and tasted great.  It was more tender than some fillets I have had recently.  A+!My wife ordered a pork roast dish, that had pork so tender you didn't need a knife.  She really liked the dish.My daughter went with the 8 ounce burger, and was very impressed.  She ordered it medium rare, and it was cooked to order.  She loved it.My son ordered one of the pizzas, and was a little surprised when a large, thin crust pizza arrived (pleasantly surprised - he was expecting a lot less.)  The pizza was great.We ordered desert, which included carrot cake (we ordered 1 piece for 2 people, and it was the right choice - very heavy, very good), along with S'mores and a Neopolitan fruit dish, all of which were very good.The only reason this isn't getting 5 stars is the noise level - the interior is nicely appointed, and very well done, but the acoustics are not very good.  Lots of hard surfaces result in a loud restaurant, where it was hard to hear our server.We'll be back.  The entire ticket with tip was less than $110 for four adults.",

                "review": "FINALLY! We were all being teased for so long about when it would actually open! I went it's opening weekend and let me be clear when I say this rating is based on beers alone, I didn't get a chance to try the food yet!I'll start by saying that the atmosphere is really cool. It reminds me of a Blind Pig Brewery meets Seven Saints or something like that. They call themselves a gastro-brewery instead of a gastro-pub, which I think fits the bill pretty well. The place is divided up nicely with the bar being it's own area and a nicer looking restaurant on the other side. I have to say though, I was a bit surprised to hear that it's only open until 11, that doesn't seem wise for an area of town that's so reliant on the nightlife.As far as the beer goes, they had 18 on tap that were freshly made on the spot and they were pretty amazing. I was surprised to hear that they didn't have anything but their own brews available, and I worried about how my non-fancy beer fans felt, but then when I tasted their Champaign Blonde Ale, it was EXACTLY like a Bud Light. I think my favorite that I sampled was the Downstate Pale Ale, and the Raspberry Wheat Ale was a bit too much for me. But overall, I think they covered their bases pretty well.I definitely can't wait to come back and try the food (which I hear is truuuuly delicious) and give this place it's 5th and final star!UPDATE!So I went back and finally got to try the food. I believe I ordered the Swordfish, my boyfriend got the jambalaya and we both split some of the beer battered asparagus. I'll say right away the asparagus was the best part, which didn't surprise me because everyone raved about their appetizers, but I never heard much about the main dishes. My swordfish wasn't that great, to be honest, and I'm pretty easy to please. My boyfriend's jambalaya wasn't superb either, but then again, that's probably not the best thing to order at a place like this.All in all, everything was good, and a nice change from what's available downtown, but if I had one piece of advice, it would be stick to the beer and small plates!",

The menu is extensive and has a great variety-- whether you're looking for sandwich/burger or a full entree. Everything I've tried so far has been great. They also have awesome beers. They brew sour beers, which I had never tried until I came here. Overall, great place to go no matter what you're looking for! Try the salmon and the cheese curds!",

Over all, I found the flavors in each dish are well balanced and don't compete for attention.

The service staff knowledgeable and attentive.  I wish I had one where I live and will absolutely be back when I find myself in Champaign again.",

                "review": "We've been to Destihl maybe six times now, for brunch, lunch, and dinner. Most of the food is very good, better conceived and made than a lot of other area restaurants offer. Portions are fairly generous (not so much with brunch items), and the price fits the quality of ingredients and preparation. The staffing is good, service is timely, and the decor is charming. The craft beers made on site are wonderful. Try a series of 4 ouncers to build your own tasting. The flavor profiles given on the brew menu seem so far to have been accurate.For appetizers, I recommend the shrimp ceviche (technically a \"small plate\") and the stone oven pretzels (you get two, with cheese and spicy honey mustard dips). I've tried one soup, the corn and chicken chowder, which was very good, nice SW pepper flavor without overwhelming the chicken. We've had sandwiches and entrees, from burgers to steak, and it's all been really delicious. The food is in the American Contemporary Casual style -- better than Houlihan's at the i-Hotel in our opinion.The only bad experience we've had with the food has been the cedar plank brie dessert. It was badly prepared (the brie wasn't even room temperature) and either the recipe was off or the honey-chili sauce was made incorrectly, because it was completely unbalanced and unpalatable. The smoke flavor reacted poorly with what was on the plank, too. We took the brie home (a big piece) and cut off the rind to eat the middle later, but it still tasted of rank sauce and smoke. We did not go back to the restaurant for a couple of months because of just how bad this was.  I wrote the general manager and he was good about it, offering to review the recipe and preparation with the lead chef. Since returning to Destihl, we've had good experiences again -- the place is consistent, a fun place to socialize, and a nice addition to CU's restaurant scene.",

Not one of the entrees are even vegetarian (they have a few vegetarian burgers and such, however). They have exactly one vegan dish: vegetables cooked in cashew cream. That's all folks. The dish was distinctly unremarkable, but most of the menu appears that way (this applies to even the animal products dishes; Destihl is only good for a select few dishes: salmon, mac and cheese, and burgers). I also ordered potato croquettes because from the description, there's no cheese in it (the other descriptions listed cheese, so I mistakenly assumed that these were cheese-free). In fact, the potato croquettes do have cheese in them. Just a note.I can't give 5 stars to a restaurant that I don't personally enjoy. But I think if you like beer and American food, you'd like this place.Just a note: I received a Compliment from another Yelper who seems to have misinterpreted my review. I would never take stars off because a restaurant is not vegan friendly especially when it never claimed to be. If you read my review, you can see my comments on the taste of the food. I even specifically wrote that my criticisms applied to animal product dishes LOL! I have tried many, many dishes at Destihl, both vegan and non-vegan. Destihl is two stars because the food is poor, not because it's not vegan (I almost want to laugh writing this because I can't believe someone would actually gloss over my whole review just to leave me a negative comment. It's pretty funny how willfully thick people insist on being). Yes, at one point I hated Destihl but I grew to love it...but that was because I was settling and I was naive. After trying many other restaurants, my opinion is that Destihl, overall, is an average to below average restaurant that may appeal to some people. I write about both sides to help veg*ns make eating out choices. They are never reasons to take stars off. I even explicitly noted which meat and cheese dishes were good so that I could highlight the good stuff about Destihl. People are really funny. This Yelper also asked me why I don't just exclusively visit vegan restaurants (even if you're not vegan, I think you can see how funny this comment is). Cheers.",

Well, anything is possible it was a tarter beer but still a very light ale. They didn't have their dunkelweizen here which was disappointing. I got hungry waiting for my friend so I ordered the Ancho chips and dip. The chips were just okay but the vinegar and the dressings were really quite good. The habanero vinegar wasn't overpoweringly hot but had a nice kick and the ranch was more than just a ranch dressing. I had the bison burger because I haven't had bison meat in a while and it was just as good. The burger though, was all right the bison, slightly sweeter and less greasy than ground beef was good. The dressing on it though took away from the flavor of the meat  but the fries were actually quite tasty.  Overall, it's still an okay place",

I had the Cuban sandwich and one of the better Cubans I've had in a long time!  My wife and friend both had a pasta dish which they enjoyed.  The waiter also was very knowledgeable about the menu and large number of beer choices, all of which were excellent too.  There are lots of choices in Champaign and I recommend anyone try Distihl!",

The food is okay, I can't say that it is amazing or that I crave coming here for dinner. It is also not cheap by any imagination, but this is one of the hot spots for dinner with the gastropub concept and microbrewery on site. The first time I came during a work function. I had the bavarian style pretzel. Nothing really exciting. Pretzel with cheese sauce or the IPA mustard. It sort of reminded me of the pretzels you would get at the amusement park. I ended up trying the most expensive item on the menu which was the espresso rubber ribeye 18 oz with bone in, chiptole espress bbq sauce, asparagus, and bacon truffle mashed potatoes for 30 dollars. Somehow the meat just does not match steak hour quality meat. You are expecting an angus quality steak, but somehow my ribeye had a huge chunk of fat in the middle. Good ribeye is marbled with fat to give it that amazing tenderness and flavor, this was not that. The espresso rubbed gave it sort of a burnt flavor. I can't say that I was impressed. The second time I came went with the beer battered bacon egg burger 14.50 that had angus beef, beer battered jalapeno bacon, bacon jam, along with a fried egg topped with smoked white cheddar cheese and a brioche bun. Somehow the batter of the bacon was super thick so you ended up having chicken tender size bacon on top of the burger. The blend of angus beef patty with bacon jam and fried egg is an amazing combo, but somehow the oil must have not been changed for the beer batter bacon. It was a very dark color and had a strong not so pleasant oil taste. If you like gastro-pub food you can give this place a try, but once again for the price you pay the food just falls short of that bar.Pros: gastro-pub, lots of beer selection, quick serviceCons: not top quality protein, the oil may have not been changed for a while given the overused oil taste, expensiveHidden deals:Join the desthil guest reward program. I did not get offered this at my visit.You get 25 dollars back after spending 500 dollars. Double points at lunch time during the week.",

We had to wait for a while for the other people to show up and the staff was very amenable to it, acted like that was just fine. They even held back our entree order until they got there.We liked the deviled eggs for the appetizer, they were really good. I had the chili which was very disappointing, I wouldn't get it again.

I also recommend the herbivore burger if you like veggie burgers. It is huge though so be prepared to share with someone or take half home. The cedar plank salmon is also very good and comes with grilled vegetables and a nice arugula salad. The salad was a bit too overdressed for my taste so request it to be lightly dressed if you don't like a lot of dressing.As far as dessert goes I've tried the cherry bread pudding, s'mores, chocolate cake, and the wild sour berry tart and out of all of those I would recommend the tart and the chocolate cake. They give you a pound of chocolate cake so only order it if you are not already stuffed from your meal or if you want to take it home. Half of it was more than enough for 4 of us.",

The burger is bland and if you're lucky (note my sarcasm), you'll get a few nice, chewy chunks of fat in there. I got some kind of s'mores dessert and it was a cheap mess. How can you make a bad s'mores dessert??? It's cruel! Their menu is so awesome, but they're SUCH a tease! They cannot execute anything well. I gave them two stars: one, for the selection in the menu and the other, because I haven't had any beer here and it is kind of a brewery I guess so I can't judge them there.

My husband and I have been here a few times, and we both really like the potato croquettes (mmm, chimichurri) and the marinated cucumber salad. Both have a spicy bite -- definitely recommended. The rest of the food is okay. Pizzas are decent, the salads seem to rely a lot on the dressings, similarly so with the sandwiches. Service is good and friendly, although can come down a little on the overwhelmingly chatty side. Still, in a place as big as this one, it's nice to not feel like you've gotten lost or abandoned.Unfortunately, I can't recommend much else. The design and marketing of Destihl gives off a very artisanal vibe, particularly in their choice of \"craft beer,\" but their beers are at best uneven and at worst anemic shadows of what they could be. Most recently, I was disappointed in the pumpkin porter, which sounds like it should be layered and spicy and complex. Mostly, it was bitter and I could only taste the pumpkin if I really thought about it. I've felt similarly about all of their beers that I have tried, although a few are okay (the Hefeweizen, the Tripel). I want to be seduced by the delicious descriptions (and oh, they DO have a good writer), but I just can't.This place reads to me as a large chain that wants to be a small, careful, art-and-ingredient-driven restaurant, but it doesn't get there. It's confusing. 2 1/2 stars, rounding down.",

The food has been sensational, but they tend to overseason some dishes. Several people in our party ordered Caesar salads (which is half a head of romaine topped with a fried egg) and they were grossly over peppered. The pulled pork from my Carolina pork two ways was the spiciest pulled pork I've ever tasted in my life, so much so that I couldn't take more than two bites in a row. It wasn't a problem ubiquitous throughout our group or between visits, though.The atmosphere is very nice. It's dark and clean. The service has always been good.",

The drafts come in three sizes, which is really nice. My friends and I got the pretzels with cheese and mustard dipping sauces, and LOVED them. I got the bison burger with fries and had to stop myself from eating the whole thing before my stomach exploded! Great wait staff and a very classy atmosphere.Visit #2: Another great beer experience. Got a pizza this time, which was pleasantly adequate for a one person dinner. It was thin and crispy, but not crunchy...just the way I like it! We sat at a window near the bar and watched downtown during sunset, which was really nice. I like the corner location...lots of natural light!Will definitely consider coming here whenever I want to eat downtown. Reasonably priced for the quality, and a great overall dining experience.",

We were impressed with ALL of it.  Flat bread was good if you're in the mood for starchy foods--the pizza had a very thin crust, which I loved, so you could eat more of the toppings...and the salad was HUGE for its small price.We tasted several of the beers and ended up getting a growler to go because we loved it so much.Decor was a bit industrial, and very contemporary, especially for the Midwest.  We will definitely return and bring friends!",

Honestly, my biggest pet peeve with Destihl is their attempt at trying to create elevated food that just come off as tacky. For instance when I split their quesadilla appetizer they proudly touted it was deconstructed. That meant the appetizer consisted of some tortillas with melted cheese and a side of so-so grilled steak. Give me a break- I've had some cleverly deconstructed items before and that was not the case here. They do a similar thing with smores (e.g. the marshmallows come pre-melted). Tacky might be a strong word but to serve things in ways that are poorly executed and actually make eating your meal less enjoyable and more complicated in an attempt to seem high-end is pretty tacky.",

I personally love the beer-battered asparagus and beer-battered fish and chips. My husband has ordered the fish tacos on one occasion and pizza on another. The fish tacos were okay. The pizza is good. They also have a gluten-free menu and a kids' menu. Even though we have never taken our 2.5 year old to a kids' restaurant, and she is used to dining with grown-ups in grown-up restaurants, it's nice that they accommodate young diners with crayons to color on the kids' menu. Even the most patient young foodie could use a quiet distraction while they wait. Glad we have this restaurant in the C-U. I highly recommend it.",

It took less than 5 minutes to get seated and less than 10 minutes to have our order taken. Within 2 minutes of having our order taken, the soup we ordered came out. The main entree came out in a timely fashion as well.Items I ordered were:Three Cheese & Ale SoupStuffed Poblano PepperCajun-Style Shrimp Po' BoyThe soup was overall very delicious. It was a bit salty but the creamy consistency was amazing and the bacon and green onions really gave the dish some nice texture and crunch. The soup also had a slight bitterness which was good as well. I highly recommend this dish. The stuffed pepper had great flavor but lacked texture. The potato and cheese filling was a bit mushy and the pepper being mushy as well didn't help. I wish the pepper had a bit more crunchy texture to accompany the creaminess of the potato and cheese. The sauce was great and had a nice flavor with some heat. The rice and corn was delicious as well. I probably wouldn't recommend this dish. The po' boy was pretty good. The bread was toasted well and gave the sandwich a nice crunch. Shrimp was a bit overcooked and the veggies were kind of just slammed together in some sauce. However, flavor was there. I took a risk in ordering a Louisiana style dish here and it didn't really hit the mark. I would still recommend this dish nonetheless. I was going to give this place 3 stars but the service is what made this place shine. Therefore, 4 stars it is! Overall, not a bad experience and would come back.",

There was not much of the cheese sauce that was supposed to be on the sandwich, either.  Did it taste good?  Sure, when I managed to get a bite that actually had all the ingredients of the sandwich in it.  Also, the top piece of bread was hard, probably because it'd been under the warmer for a while.I feel like they charge high prices for mediocre food; I do like having a spendy meal every now and then, but Destihl is not where I would go when I do.",

It was fairly fast service as well for being as many of us as there were.  I liked the menu selection here to.  Lots of gourmet and different food items to choose from, not the same old stuff you see at most restaurants.  They have a unique twist to your average or popular dishes.  Pretty cool.Now on to the food.... They had me at beer battered jalapeo bacon! Omg it was delicious! We also tried the beer battered asparagus which was equally as good.  For my meal I got the green chile mac and cheese with pork.  It was good, I wish I would've ordered something with a bit more substance (not much meat in it) but I guess that was my own fault! The flavor of what I had was great though.  I also tried my moms stuffed pablano pepper which was great! I wish I would've gotten that.  Everyone seemed to love their food here.  Oh, and the carrot cake is TO DIE FOR! I highly recommend it, the pieces are as big, if not bigger, than my head! The prices were also fair.  I really enjoyed this place!

The plus side is I'm forced to try something new when they switch things up. Destihl is a nice spot to go to relax and have a drink. They have a small selection of small plates that are interesting and mostly good. I've never had bad service here and love the fact that they validate parking!",

                "review": "Destihl (a play on De Stijl? no idea) is an inconsistently passable restaurant with a nice line of beers. They're also a brewery, if you're into that sort of thing, and my experience has been that the waitstaff are very helpful and knowledgeable when it comes to the stuff on tap.So if you like the idea of a flight of carefully-selected brews and tasty (if not slightly overpriced) appetizers appeals, stop by.Don't bother with sitting down for dinner. I've limped out of dinner here maybe five times in the past several years. Some reviewers described the food as 'delicious' (they are wrong); a few others as 'inconsistent' or 'not great' (correct). As a purveyor of hastily-prepared American slow food, Destihl is unremarkable, and the breadth of their menu probably suffices to describe the care that each dish has received. Some dishes are actually quite nice, if still too expensive, but you're unlikely to know which are worth your time unless you've got a secret decoder ring or something.If you're looking to blow some cash on food downtown, think about what kind of food you really want. You're likely to get the same (or a similar) dish done better somewhere else. It's like a rich man's Applebees -- the food is better dressed and the ambience is less \"shopping mall,\" but your wallet hurts more than it should and your tongue is left just as wanting.Oh, and if you ignore the rest of my advice, don't ignore this: don't get the big chocolate cake for dessert. It is the most over-sized lump of grocery store crap I've ever tasted. Its spot on the dessert menu is downright insulting.",

She indicated that our waitress had revealed our past unhappy experience and wanted to make sure we were ok and appreciated that we had come back. Needles to say I was very surprised. Props to the waitress for not only remembering but acknowledging our prior discontent. We were given a comp card and apologized for the past fumble. I appreciated it.

I had dijon chicken the last time I was there and it was burnt and over cooked but the sides were underdone. My boyfriend got a steak which came out a bit too rare and was just a bad cut- riddled with lines of fat.

Usually I have to settle for something bland or uninteresting, but Destihl has lots of imaginative and delicious options.  We started with the beer-battered asparagus which was pretty tasty.  I ordered the stuffed pablano which was absolutely amazing.  It was spicy and had a really interesting mix of flavors.  My mom got the Thai fried chicken and my dad got the ribeye, which they both loved.  My boyfriend got the bison burger which he thought was good but not as amazing as our dishes.  The second time we went was for lunch.  I got the lunch combo with the portabella and brie sandwich and the beer and cheddar soup.  The sandwich was yummy but the soup was really very delicious.  Definitely comfort food and really hit the spot.  My mom got the Thai fried chicken again and my dad got the Thai steak which he said was even better than the ribeye.  My boyfriend ordered the Dijon chicken which he really enjoyed.You should probably make a reservation for dinner but likely do not need one for lunch.  They also serve brunch on the weekends until 2:00 and those items looked pretty delicious as well.  We have had great servers at Destihl and the restaurant has a nice ambiance.  Plus, they don't have a corkage fee!  The first time we went, we brought our own bottle of wine and there was no charge!  All in all we have had really great meals here and will definitely be returning!",

The beer selection was OK, but nothing stellar - and one of the beers I got was on the warm side. The ambiance was nice, and it was quiet enough to make it easy to talk with the rest of the table, even though a world series game was on and it was pretty crowded. The food was just mediocre. The fries (which were recommended as a side) were tasty, but a bit soggy. I had a chicken sandwich that was tasty, but the amount of meat was pretty small - it was a thin cut (probably half a breast pounded flat) and I ended up peeling away half the bun, which was twice as big as the cut.My friends seemed to like their food (burger, bacon-wrapped dates), but I don't think they would give it more than 2.5 or 3 stars either. I gave it 3 stars because the prices were OK, but I'm used to California prices - so this might be more the norm for Champaign.",

A brew-pub has to have great beer-cheese soup, right?  WRONG!!!!  The soup was like a creamy caraway broth with some green onion garnish.  No taste of cheese or beer, just gross.  The Pastrami Reuben, described as served on Cranberry Nut bread, looked interesting on the menu.  However, what I received was essentially a large cranberry nut scone (about 4\" tall) sliced in half with three small pieces of pastrami, a few shreds of sauerkraut, and invisible swiss cheese.  I normally do not send things back in a restaurant, but this showing was so horrible, I sent it back.  I tried the $13 American Kobe burger instead.  Eh.  It was an average - but by no means worth $13 - burger (think akin to the pre-made patties you find at Sam's Club) and, once again, the bread-to-meat ratio was WAY off.   Anyway, $40 later, we walked out very disappointed.  I can think of several places in town I could go and spend much less for a much higher quality experience.",

I went with the Potato Crusted Rainbow Trout.  It had wonderful flavor!  My co-worker got my usual and she loved them too.  We decided to go for dessert as well.  I ordered the Creme Brulee.

It was a MUCH bigger place than I anticipated, and I would love to see it on a day when it was busy. We were there about 3pm on a Monday. I was immediately impressed with the vibe of the place - very hip, and something you would expect to find in any major city's downtown. The beer list was posted on a board above the bar and was HUGE for a local microbrewery. Where I expected to find 8-10 local beers supported by a smattering of other regional brews, the list of beers brewed in house was closer to 20-25. As I had never been to Destihl, I asked the bartender to select 4 beers for me to sample (this is typical practice for me -- a good bartender will ask the right questions and figure out what you like). He started by asking if I wanted darker or lighter beer, and then asked me about some different flavor profiles.  After a few questions, he came back with four delicious beers.  I tried the Roadblock British Red Ale, Black Angel Stout, Deadhead Double Red, and Antiquity Rye Wine.  All were really awesome.I was very pleased with the bartenders knowledge of the beer, the fast friendly service, and the atmosphere in general.Next time I'm in town this is DEFINITELY a place I plan to return, and hopefully next time I'll get to order some food as well.",

I couldn't get the Yelp App to check me in so I could upload my pic of the tastiest stout I've ever had, so you are just going to have to trust me on its delicousity. I tried a taster (4oz for $1.50) of their berry weiss beer and it was a little too much berry for me, but if you like that kind of thing, you will love Destihl's take on it: the flavors of sweet and tart bounce back and forth dynamically as you sip. A companion loved their IPA, lauding the freshness and the spicyness of the hops.The food is as good as anywhere else downtown. My table ordered the portabello sandwich which was really hearty and came with kettle chips with a touch of seasoning and Destihl's Kobe burger, which is served on a fancy bun I did non recognize and stacked with thick jalepeno bacon, bleu and white chedar cheeses, pickles, and comes with the best steak fries I've ever tasted. That burger is about the same price as Farren's and the verdict was it was just as good, if not better, owing to the extra special toppings. Destihl's fries are thick badasses with the skin on and huge flecks of kosher or sea salt and were both perfectly crispy and cooked the whole way thru. Those are served with their balsamic vinegar (and expresso bean?) barbecue sauce that is unlike any I've ever had. As good as the kettle chips are, I highly recommend you sub in for the steak fries (though I saw some gorgeous piles of sexy shoestring fries served with other dishes, giving me one more reason for a quick return).Another reason for a quick return is the very impressive menu. Vegetarian will have no problem here, nor will the health-concious. They have a wide and deep menu spanning from American classic pub fare to trendy fusion dishes usually found only in more expensive restaurants. Prices were not exceedingly low, however value is good. I did not see their spirits or wine menus, but the lineup behind the bar bodes well for those not in the mood for beer.This place takes the best of Boltini's, Seven Saints, the Pigs, Radio, and Bacaro and serves it up in a killer setting with great  modern ambiance. I will never pass up an invite to eat here.",

They are mostly a trendy place to go eat and stare at tanks. Most beer geeks will be sorely disappointed. They also charge quite a bit for a growler of beer. A fair number of them are $30-$50...which is stupid for beer of this caliber.Food:The food is pretty good, but all the pretty things to look at in there cost money, which means the food is not cheap. The menu always has interesting choices and they will not let you down.",

I don't like my burgers to have a ton of stuff on them because I like to taste the meat. One: they know how to cook meat \"medium\" (it's still slightly pink and perfect). Two: the meat tastes AMAZING! Whatever they do this is probably some of the best meat I've tasted. Tasty beer (they brew their own plus it's not over-carbonated) and the service is really good. Usually I don't really care about service but all of the service we've gotten from this place is setting the bar. The servers actually know what they are doing and what they are serving--plus they're all good looking! I absolutely love this place. Remember to bring your growlers because you can also purchase some of that yummy beer for later.",

The waiters and bartenders I've talked to have been incredibly friendly.The food's better than you'd expect, actually.  The salad was good, which is maybe not what you'd expect from a place that labels itself a brew pub.  The pizza's a little boring, but that's probably just the vegetarian ones I'm limited to.  They serve continuously, they have a large cocktail list, they take my American Express... it's everything a burgeoning yuppie alcoholic could want in a brew pub.Except that's not really me so here's what I don't like.The atmosphere.  As I read through the descriptions they say \"oh the atmosphere is great!\" and I say... are you at the same restaurant?  It's what a corporate design team thinks of as good atmosphere.  Large, airy, and completely devoid of personality.  It matches Jim Gould's across the street very well actually.The whole place really just reeks of chain, and I don't think that bothers most people at all but if I want to go in by myself and have a late lunch I feel very awkward.  I'm happy to go in with friends and have cocktails and split a pound of cake.  (They actually inform me that it is an 11 pound cake split 10 ways, so slightly more than a pound!)Worth checking out, if for no other reason than you too have probably been watching them work on this place for a couple years.  You can't NOT go.",

Strongly infatuated: \"he became besotted with his best friend's sister\".2. Intoxicated; drunk.Now, I am currently the first definition of besotted, with Destihl. I LOVED my visit. I went with Mr. Husband and a Very Close Friend (VCF) before seeing a movie at the Art Theater. Upon leaving, I may have been the second definition of besotted. (Just kidding, I only had one beer. I swear, my Yelp reviews make me sound like an alcoholic sometimes.)We went on a Monday evening around 6. We were seated right away. Mr. Husband and I had never been there, and we were surprised how big the restaurant actually is - it doesn't look that big from the outside. Our waiter came over right away and gave us a nice little menu introduction. I don't know why they've made a restaurant based on the things I personally like, but they did - I wanted EVERYTHING on the menu. Seriously. I haven't had such a hard time deciding on what to order for quite some time. VCF and I decided to split a small plate and an appetizer, so we got the 'House Olives' and the Bacon, Egg & Cheese deviled eggs. For my meal, I got the beer & cheddar soup and the spinach salad. VCF got the bison burger, and Mr. Husband got a special item, a bacon cheeseburger with sweet potato fries.Food: Very good, but to be honest, it *could* have been better. If Yelp let me give 4.5 stars, I would've. Everything was solid, but there were a couple things that might just push it over the top. For instance, the house olives small plate? It was agreed that it could be improved by serving the olives pre-chopped, not whole - sort of a mix between an olive salad and a tapenade. The deviled eggs were good, but the yolk was just a bit stiffer than I would've liked. The beer & cheddar soup was yum, but the scallions would have been a little better more finely sliced. The spinach salad was good, but the maple in the maple jalapeno bacon dressing was a little too sweet, and overpowered the other good stuff (grilled portabella mushroom? hell yes.) Another reason I'm torn: I love that they use ingredients from local places when possible, and have put an emphasis on sustainable farming. I'm all for buying locally and supporting small farms and businesses. On the other hand, the way it's flaunted just strikes me as a tad pretentious. Personal bias, but still.Service - Another ALMOST 5 stars. My only issue with our waiter was that he was TOO attentive. Really friendly, very knowledgeable about the menu, gave good recommendations, was able to tell us what HIS favorites are (it drives me crazy when waiters have no idea what's good on the menu.) However, he came by every 5 minutes or so. I always have mixed feelings about that. I like a server who is *there* when I need a water refill or a new fork, etc, but coming by too often just breaks up the conversation. Ambiance - Very cool. Very big-city. I like it. I also like that it's BIG. Ample room between tables. We chose a booth, and it was perfect. The noise level is ideal - quiet enough to talk at a normal level, loud enough that it doesn't feel like everyone in the area can hear what you're saying. Dessert - I can't tell you the last time I ordered dessert after dinner! That NEVER happens! (I actually can tell you, it was at my mom-in-law's birthday dinner in early October.) But VCF knows how to sweet-talk me into sweets (heh), and our waiter was VERY convincing when telling us about the stout ice cream sandwiches, which feature a housemade chocolate ice cream made with their own stout, served on chocolate brownies. Oh. Mah. Gah. SO GOOD. The stout ice cream was phenomenal. The dessert consists of two sandwiches, so you get four brownies and two scoops of ice cream. This would be great to  5 out of 5 stars for the dessert!! Price - Another 5 out of 5 stars. I was expecting that I'd have one entree and a beer. We ended up with a ton of food! For $38.77 before tip (I saved my receipt!), we got: -A soda-A 12 oz. beer - the Malius Apple Blonde Ale - so good!-House Olives app-Spinach salad-Soup-Bacon cheeseburger special-1/2 of the stout ice cream sandwichesSo while I can't yet give Destihl a 'best of the best' rating, I'm definitely a fan, and certainly willing to give it another few tries. I don't want to deter anyone from going here, because my visit was truly enjoyable. I'm already planning to permanently take Jim Gould out of my date-night lineup and replace it with Destihl. I just want to acknowledge that there is some room for improvement. I think with a tiny bit of tweaking, Destihl could easily be one of the top restaurants in C-U.",

You can also get growlers for like $20. Great deal. They generally have one of each type of brew and they're generally pretty solid brews. I got the Bela - Imperial Pilsner - which was great. Good, strong beer but very drinkable.This time I started with the Corn & Chicken chowder which has a bit of chipotle espresso BBQ sauce on top. Wonderful flavors, really was. Very delicate corn flavor mixed with the hint of bbq and given some weight from the just marginally creamy chowder. The soup was nothing short of phenomenal. Must Have.I then had the Farm & Field burger. Really interesting combination of flavors between the lamb and the bison within the patty and then it's topped with just a wonderful combination of delicious ingredients. Who would've thought that combining pesto, sun dried tomato aioli, havarti cheese, soy onions, etc on a burger would produce such an intriguing concoction of flavors!! My bun did come out quite burnt, but the rest of the burger made up for it.I'd get it again in a heartbeat.Only downside, no room for dessert.Can't wait to go back.",

The croquettes were run-of-the-mill, but good nonetheless.  The bacon was interesting, but certainly not a taste sensation.The main course were pretty variable.  My wife ordered the shrimp and grits - which was far too overpriced for such a meager portion.  Though, it was fairly tasty.  I ordered a Brewmaster's pizza which was very good.The main reason Destihl loses a star is the speed with which we received our drinks order.  It must have taken about 15 minutes after ordering for us to receive our drinks.  Eventually, we were informed of the backup at the bar.  I expect better though.Also, unrelated to my rating, there appeared to be a large number of employees standing around at the greeting station watching other employees working.  This could be training, then again, it could be the reason some of the food items are so expensive for the product!",

                "review": "If there were an option for negative stars, DESTIHL Champaign would have a rating of -5 stars.  What a complete failure this restaurant is.  This place reminds me too much of the Jim Gould success failure story.  It's a tale of how a restaurant owner and chef become to sure of themselves and stop trying only to discover complete failure.  I pride myself in knowing good food and good restaurants.  I have studied cullinary technique and have a passion for fresh, quality ingredients that produces a meal that leaves you longing for more.  I write this review, having visited DESTIHL three times spread out over the course of a year.  I sent my food back two out of the three times.  The second time, I ordered the veggie burger which was hands down the WORST veggie burger I've ever sampled.  I did not send this back because it was not the way the burger was cooked, it was a pure and simple failure on the design.  My first experience I ordered swordfish.  It was overcooked, returned and cooked perfectly.  My husband ordered the Bison burger, medium rare and it came out well done.  While waiting for the food to return, the manager apologized and brought us free appetizers.  The meal ticket was reduced due to the error in the kitchen.  I was optimistic about this restaurant and the situation was handled perfectly.Last night, I returned for what I was hoping to be a perfect swordfish.  My husband's and I's order was the same.  Bison burger and swordfish.  First try at our order lended the same results.  Both dishes overcooked and returned.  Second try at our order, my husbands burger was cooked perfectly, my swordfish was raw.  Third try at the swordfish, still raw!  I changed my order to salmon at the waiter's recommendation.  Finally a manager appears and delivers the Salmon stating \"this is cooked to the chef's perfection.\"  The manager slither's off like a snake before I even touch the salmon.  Without cutting into the salmon, It was obvious that this fish was too raw.  My family had finished eating and after an hour and a half wait with no food, no appetizers, and a chef that I was now convinced can not cook at all, I ordered a Greek Salad.  This salad looked like someone threw the ingredients on my plate.  No order, presentation was horrible.  The dressing was red oil.  This dressing did not taste like greek dressing at all.  I ate the salad in disbelief that this place can not even prepare a good salad.  Our ticket was once again adjusted but this experience left a sour taste in my mouth.  I e-mailed the general manager and COO for the company and am awaiting a reply.  I would recommend no one go to this restaurant.  Seated across the street is Ko Fusion, an amazing restaurant.  This restaurant is too close for comfort for DESTIHL as this is where I will be seated watching DESTIHL's doors close for good if they do not find a chef that can cook the menu that was created.EDIT:  Less than 12 hours after my e-mail, I received a phone call from the general manager.  He was very kind and appologized.  More than this he listened.  He was kind and acknowledged that my concerns were valid.  He stated over and over again that there are no good excuses.  Humiliy allows for growth and I hope that this general managers humility induces change that produces solid growth.In March 2013, My husband and I used compensation cards to return.  The following is my email to the manager of destihl.I e-mailed back in October regarding a disappointing dinner and service that my family I experienced at Destihl Champaign.  We received compensation cards and returned tonight in order to assess if the service and food improved.  Our server was once again phenomenal, but the food was less than stellar.  My husband and I both ordered the swordfish, which were once again not cooked properly.  The swordfish were dry and over cooked, even upon reorder.  I guessed by the drying of the fish that a meat thermometer was used to assess if they were cooked properly, which in my opinion is an amateur error.  I then ordered a small portion Greek salad due to my hunger, my husband did not order one and we were charged for both.  I then ordered a gluten free Mediterranean pizza and my husband, a bone in ribeye.  My pizza could not possibly have been gluten free because within seconds, I felt sick and bloated and my husband's ribeye was cooked unevenly and dried out!  Most likely another piece of meat fallen victim to the meat thermometer.  With a history in restaurant service and cooking, I was appalled that we were charged for the salads and the pizza and were virtually comped nothing for the less than stellar food that we received.  Please do not send us any more compensation cards as we will not be returning, but I wanted to let you know that we are completely dissatisfied with ALL of our experiences at Destihl Champaign.",

I was also fond of the house drafts that I tried (including an apricot beer that's one of my favorite Belgians). The beers they brew onsite are all really good. The dessert menu is also fantastic- try the chocolate cake that's the size of your head if you're looking for diabetes. The Smores plate is also fun.All that said, the food here is a bit more expensive than it's worth. Burgers are cheaper (and better) at Farren's, Radio Maria has better Cubans for the price and the entrees are nothing too impressive- good, but not great. I've also found service to be a bit hit or miss- we've had waiters that have been remarkably friendly and courteous, but last time they substituted a more expensive glass of wine for one they apparently didn't have without telling us. I like going here, and it's a nice change of pace every once in a while, but rarely do I go \"Boy, we need to go to Desthil.\"",

For my main course, I ordered the Brewmaster's Pizza, which was served with chicken, andouille sausage, ale onions, and an espresso-chipotle barbecue sauce. The pizza was nothing to rave about, but it probably would have been quite a bit better if a) the pizza had been served hot instead of lukewarm and rapidly cooling, and b) the crust had been cooked all the way through. My brother's pizza was also apparently cold and undercooked, and reading through the other reviews, this seems to be common for diners at Destihl who order pizza. I think I've probably accumulated enough evidence at this point--Destihl is not worth the high prices. There are so many better restaurants in Champaign.",

In this case it's warranted because it's their own beer and they're responsible for the quality.  It was just a very thin beer, it didn't have enough flavor to stand up to the food.  I had their meatloaf dish, and I appreciate the idea of creating a blend of beef, bison, and lamb the loaf itself was over mixed and too dense.  The mashed potatoes seemed like they were made from a box, or they were over whipped, almost to a paste but there was enough butter to make them creamy.  The roasted vegetables were pretty good.  Ended with the bread pudding, which was a drier than I like, but the caramel sauce was good.  I liked how other things sounded on the menu if I go back I will update the rating but currently unimpressed.",

Easy going vibe, spacious bar, everything squeaky clean, good beers to sample and the good variety menu that goes along well with everything.  The sandwiches, soup and salads were excellent for lunch and there were plenty of people sampling the many items on the menu... which made it impossible for us to get a table the next night without waiting.  So next time when I go, I will make a reservation.",

It is one of those lovely little Midwestern university towns where one could spend a nice life far from the cut and thrust of city life. When in Champaign, one could do worse than to eat at Destihl. The place is modern brew pub of the sort that was popular in the late 90s in fleshpots like San Francisco. Get their flight, it is quite good. The Amber is sweet and floral. They serve nice gastro pub fare. I had the fish (of some sort) that was quite nice. Mid-west prices. Sit on the corner patio in front of Destihl, sipping their beer and watching the sunset on downtown Champagne. Good times.(Whew! So snobby!)",

Best part?  Small (4oz) tasting portions $1-2.  GREAT service.-Every time I visit my parents in good ol' Chambana they have a \"new restaurant in town\" that hubby and I MUST try.  Or five.  This time, Destihl was first on their list... and they are so crazy about it, they took us twice.  In ONE DAY.First, for lunch.  No beer this visit (hence the second), just lunch.  I had the Portabella Sandwich with Shoestring Fries, and it was 100% delish.  Also on the table:- Stuffed poblano pepper- Cuban sandwich- Salad with ahi tuna- Clam chowder I heard nothing but raves from the group.Late that evening we stopped in for post-dinner drinks \"and maybe a little to munch on.\"  We got three appetizers for the table:- Chorizo & Potato Flautas- Marinated Cucumbers (there's some BITE to those suckers!)- Brewmaster's Pizza (yuuuuuumm)... and all got a few 4oz tasting pours.  The beer was fantastic, some of the best I've had.  Our waiters both times were friendly and went out of their way to make sure we had a good time.One of my favorite things about this restaurant is the story my dad told (more than once) about his friend's first visit.  They were a big group, 12 I think, and stopping in before seeing a show in downtown.  They ordered food, drinks, then dessert.  There was a delay in the kitchen and they were kept waiting on their dessert for quite while... they were now running short on time, so one of the guys flagged down their waiter and told him, maybe a touch rudely, that they \"needed either dessert or the check, because we gotta get out of here.\"  The manager came back a couple of minutes later, apologized profusely, and served their dessert.  Dessert or check, and Destihl chose dessert.  Their meal and drinks for 12 were on the house.It's those kinds of stories that spread your business' name in the best possible way - you chose wisely, Destihl.  The guy's been sending over everyone he knows, always prompting with \"you gotta hear how amazingly this restaurant treated me!\"",

I was mentally writing my review all throughout dinner, and it was a solid 4 stars--until the bill came. Don't get me wrong, I am happy to pay for amazing food, but it's gotta be spot-on. Our dinner for 2 was $120, after tip. We had 2 drinks each, an appetizer, two entrees, and a dessert. I've definitely paid this much before for a comparable amount of food, but that was at some of my favorite restaurants that make sure every detail is perfect. And everything at Destihl was good, but not perfect.Here's what we had:--Stuffed dates - These had a great sweet/salty/spicy balance, but the barbecue sauce was a bit too much and a little detracting.--Mustard-glazed chicken - The chicken itself was delicious, but there was too much mustard sauce. The fingerling potatoes and green beans were both good, but not well-seasoned. The dish also didn't come out super hot.--Espresso-rubbed steak - The steak was huge and cooked well, and it had great flavor. Not my favorite steak, but still good. --Bruleed banana pudding - They made this gluten-free for me by not having pie crust, and it was phenomenal. It was the star of the show! I am still dreaming of this.The interior of Destihl is very nice--what you'd expect at an upscale gastropub. Our server was also very nice, but he was a bit new and didn't quite know the menu well yet.While I'm not head over heals for this place, I do think it's a great addition to the downtown Champaign scene! I would definitely come back the next time I'm in the city... especially for that banana pudding.",

I finally came back a year or so later and the food has definitely gotten better.This time I went for lunch and had the swordfish tacos with rice and beans on the side.   This was pretty good.  Maybe just a bit heavy on the sauce which masked a lot of the fish but the chimichurri sauce itself was good.  My wife had the chimichurri shrimp pizza and hers was excellent!  I also have to mention the last time I was here I had the beer-brined double bone in pork chop and that was easily the best dish I had here.After a few early lackluster visits this place is slowly becoming one of the better restaurants in the area.",

The bacon wasn't crispy so it was tough to chew. The sauce was so spicy we were practically crying. Salmon sandwich special was not as good as anticipated, and the bacon on the bacon cheeseburger was also not crispy. The service was so-so. While our waiter at the beginning was friendly, he repeatedly forgot things so we would spend time sitting there staring at our food because we didn't have plates or silverware. They also ran out of wine glasses so we were left sitting through our entrees without drinks that were ordered before entrees arrived, and he didn't tell us until we were finished eating.Overall, it'd be worth a shot to visit again but if the 2nd experience was similar or worse, I wouldn't try a 3rd time.",

Because of the variety, I think this is a great place to bring a group or a date if you're not sure what type of food they prefer.  The beer is all brewed at Destihl and is decent, but I've never been blown away by any of their brews.  I have been here several times and my favorite dish so far was the Cedar Plank Salmon. On my most recent trip I ordered the Kobe Burger and when I ran out of sauce, the server asked if I would like more.   I am not a dessert person, but I LOVE their dessert menu.  So, do yourself a favor and save room for dessert!Be warned, if you sit in the bar area be prepared to wait. I have actually left a few times when I haven't been given water or a menu 15 minutes after arriving.  If you sit in the main dining room however, the service is superb.",

I have to say that I found it very amusing that the priciest restaurant I went to on this trip was also the worst meal of the trip by far.I ordered the goat-cheese pesto pizza, shared the battered asparagus appetizer, and had pint of the brown ale. The battered asparagus was alright but EXTREMELY greasy, the pizza was soggy and surprisingly didn't really taste like basil or goat cheese, and the brown ale was flat out bad (trust me, I drink a lot of microbrew beer, I know what good beer tastes like). Plus, most other people at my table agreed that their food and drinks were also mediocre. Needless to say, since this is an pricier restaurant, I doubt I'd be willing to give Destihl another shot.",

Our waiter was Trent; very personable, knowledgeable and helpful.  There is no set beer flight but you can order 4 oz small glasses if you want to sample.  I really enjoyed the Oktoberfest and the Roadblock British Red Ale.  We shared the Beer Batter Asparagus for an appetizer and really enjoyed it (Trent encouraged us to squeeze the grilled lemon over the Asparagus and glad that we did).  We ordered the Lunch Combos.  The soup and sandwiches were top notch.   I know there are a lot of restaurants in the C/U area, but you can't go wrong here.  If the rest of the wait staff are as good as Trent, you will be taken care of quite nicely.   Very good beer, very good food in an inviting atmosphere, I definitely recommend Destihl.",

She did not steer me wrong.  It was so tasty that I wanted to eat another entree of it.  Every dish they brought to the table look so tempting.  Definitely a wide variety and everyone enjoyed a nice beer and atmosphere.  Glad we made reservations because the place filled up quick for a Friday night.

I drove through Illinois on a day trip and passed the Destihl sister location in Normal early in the morning before they had opened, so I decided to stay overnight in Champaign to visit the other Destihl location. I ordered the Red Chili Pork entree and it was, quite simply, remarkable. [note: I posted a tryptich Instagram photo of my dining experience here on Yelp] I also sampled several of their beer offerings, conveniently (and affordably) sold in 4 oz. taster glasses. All were more than satisfactory as compared to other microbreweries, of which I have been to many. The interior is also pleasant, being situated in a newly constructed building. There is outdoor seating, which was in high demand on the warm early evening I was here in late June. As one who travels a lot for work, I can strongly recommend this restaurant.",

Also sampled 3 of the beers...really enjoy the 4 oz options so I can try a few different varieties.We were satisfied with our entrees...a pork tenderloin special and the flat iron steak. Great flavors and cooked the way we ordered.Best part is probably dessert. The smores are a fun, gooey mess and the cherry bread pudding was tasty.We dined on a Saturday night, which was also prom night in the area and a busy sports night (we were seated in the bar area), so it was a bit noisy.

Nowhere near medium! On top of that, it was smothered with caramelized onions, which were very strong and took away from the taste of the steak! The service was average. Nothing great. Overall, I would never consider going back. I can find a better steak sandwich for a lot less at a number of different area restaurants. Coincidentally, I spoke to a friend about my experience weeks later when Destihl came up in conversation, only to find out that she had the exact situation happen to her when she visited Destihl. Her steak sandwich was extremely undercooked as well. Must be a common trend with this place. Just another common chain restaurant, as far as I'm concerned!",

Their in house brewery interested me too.I haven't been to a restaurant where they offered 4oz sample sizes of beers. I got the \"Matt and the Giant Juicy Juicy Mango IPA.\" I'm not the biggest fan of beer, but this wasn't that bad to me and also it was nice to have just a sample size so I don't waste any beer.My friend and I started out with the appetizer, chorizo stuffed dates. I have never tried these and I thought that These were amazing. The perfect blend of spicy, savory and sweet. I got the Weissenheimer Chicken. I have to compliment the chef on how juicy the chicken was. It was a big piece of chicken and not one bit dry. I thought the green beans weren't cooked as long, but the mashed potatoes were really good.My friend got the Brewmaster's pizza. I liked that it was a personal pizza and they also offer gluten free bread. It's nice that this restaurant is conscious about that.The service was awesome too. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and attentive.I felt like some foods had a spicy twist on them which I think is a nice flavor to pair with IPAs.I didn't get to try any desserts because the kitchen closed. I know so sad because I went there wanting the dessert the most, but at least my appetizer and entree was good.",

I've tried the seared scallops over curried mashed potatoes and the thai half chicken. The scallops were hardly seared and the potatoes were waaaaay over salted. The chicken on the other hand was far under spiced and seasoned. I will say their beer battered jalepeno bacon is delicious but deep fried food is pretty hard to screw up. Overall the prospect of having a modern american restaurant with an eclectic menu in the CU area is a great one, but a bit more attention to detail would greatly help Destihl.",

The decor is surprisingly upscale - really cool use of natural stone and wood. HUGE shame they didn't open with their patio ready to go, but when I inquired they said it was in the plans to open the patio soon.The beers (I tried 5, yup 5) were decent - not world-class, but decent. My favorite purely for summer drinkability was the Champaign Blonde, but I am admittedly not into dark beers at all, and there are PLENTY of dark ones and heavier Begian-style ales which I didn't try.The menu looked surprisingly interesting, (I was expecting burgers and pretzels), and between us we tried the pickled cucumber salad, the tuna carpaccio, the strawberry salad and the warm salmon and potato salad. All four dishes were winners, although the small plates ARE really small (which is exactly what we wanted). The entrees are MASSIVE for the price, and look like they are high quality meals, but I'm glad we saw how big they were before we ordered one!Service was excellent from beginning to end.The desserts also looks amazing, but I was too full to try. As a gay couple it was nice to feel comfortable and that there was a real mix of clientele - I was scared it was going to be exclusively Olive Garden-goers, but there were some hipsters, some queens, and some students as well as your typical 'casual-dining' crowd.Can't wait for the patio to open, but believe me, there will be a serious wait time on those tables - be prepared!",

I suggested we try Destihl after having a pretty good experience there with my family last time. This visit was equally as good!We opted to sit at the bar and watch the Bulls game due to the dining room wait being around 35 minutes which was much too long for two very hungry college kids.We started with a few 4oz beer samples which are very convenient and not too expensive, I dislike having to commit to a roughly $5 16oz beer not knowing much beforehand. I particularly enjoyed the oatmeal nitro but didn't much care for the Champaign blonde.The beer-battered bacon was a must-try for us since I didn't get it last time and it gets a lot of attention here on Yelp. We also opted for the cheese curds, both of these appetizers were so artery-cloggingly delicious.The Bulls started to seriously disappoint us and when our food arrived we were glad to have something else to focus on, rather than the demise of Chicago basketball this season. I ordered the meatloaf and my roommate got the rancher burger. He said his was really tasty, right up there with the burger we had at Farren's a few weaks earlier. I went with the meatloaf to try something different and when it came out I was initially a little taken aback, but after trying it that all changed. This was not your grandmother's meatloaf! It was rolled up and wrapped in prosciutto sitting on a mountain of mashed potatoes adorned with some thinly sliced vegetables all inside a cast iron skillet. The meatloaf itself was well seasoned and actually had a little spice to it. What really made this dish though was the prosciutto, it added that nice smoky pork flavor to the meatloaf. I highly recommend this dish!The service was a little different because we were at the bar. The bar staff was extremely busy due to having a packed dining room and fairly full bar as well. There were about two people taking care of us and they made sure we always had beer and were quick to clear our plates as well as check in frequently. Service: great!Overall, another great experience at Destihl. Though, like I mentioned last time, it comes a bit of a steeper price than some other potential options nearby. Either way, we really liked our food.",

Western civilization pivots on the ability to look down and see if there are feet under the door and thus realize that you have to wait a minute instead of jiggling the door handle like some pee-filled serial killer).  The service was equally uninspired -- my least favorite combination of ingratiatingly peppy and incompetent, and the food was mediocre when it got there. It took so long to appear at the table that I was sort of hoping that the cook had sent out for it from another restaurant, but no such luck.  And I only thought this might be the case because the menu says that the kitchen likes to get food from local sources. This might be technically true -- they might like it -- but there's not much evidence that they actually do it.  I think I can honestly say that the last time I experienced this kind of ambience I was in an airport restaurant.",

The strawberry blonde ale on tap was a clear favorite for us. Both their beer and dinner menus took awhile for us to look at. I was expecting traditional pub-style food, but their offerings far exceeded that.We started off with the deviled egg appetizer and the beer battered bacon appetizer. Both were very good- the beer battered bacon is a MUST. Jalapeno bacon in a tempura-like beer batter coating topped with a drizzle of maple chipotle glaze?! Yes please! When it came to our table, we slowly stopped talking and watched our plate of bacon descend in front of us. Like it came down straight from heaven. We didn't even realize we stopped talking and didn't remember what we were talking about until the bacon was gone..My friends got the jambalaya and the prosciutto-wrapped meatloaf. I really only tried part of the super tasty andouille sausage corn muffin that came with the jambalaya, as I was working on my full slab of beer-braised ribs (I gave one rib each to my friends to try though). They were perfect. Orders of magnitude better than Black Dog's ribs. I'm not sure whether or not that's a fair comparison since it's different cooking styles, but the texture of Destihl's ribs was absolutely perfect- tender, falling off the bone, but not annoyingly so.. The flavor was great also, as it tasted lovely by itself and did not need to be hidden behind sauce although the chipotle espresso bbq sauce it came with was also very tasty. My friends and I agreed that I \"won\" dinner since I ordered the best dish. My only qualm was that my shoestring fries were a little soggy and not as crispy as I would have preferred. But that's very minor.We were all pretty full, but could not pass up dessert. Like the rest of their menus, the dessert menu had a lot of tasty-sounding options. After some rock/paper/scissors, we ended up ordering the stout ice cream sandwiches which is more like four round brownie patties a la mode. But by all means, if you really wanted to, I guess you could try to eat it ice cream sandwich style. The alcohol in the chocolate stout ice cream wasn't very strong. Both the ice cream and the brownies were stellar. My friends especially loved the brownies. I was wondering what they did with the remaining brownie part after cutting out the rounds (to, you know, save waste if need be), and our waitress told us that the remainder is used for their chocolate martini? Maybe I'll check that out next time. Oh, and also, our waitress was very nice and friendly too. Overall, good service, clean place, nice decor.. everything was great. After tips, came out to ~$30/person, but actually filling up me + two guys  does require a bit of food and drink. I'm already trying to think of when I will return to try the kobe burger..",

                "review": "Hmm.  The problem with Destihl is that it's either GOOD or it's BAD.  That's kind of why the review is an in-between.  This place is off the charts when it comes to liquor.  Just don't buy booze here.  That's my honest feedback.  We had a party of 8, once, and only a few drinks were ordered (a couple waters, two ordered pop) and the bill was something astronomical (like $180!).  The other thing about Destihl is that it's a microbrewery (and,-cough-, gastropub) that's trying to be a microbrewery and a -cough- gastropub, if you catch my drift?  If not, here's the thing-- it's pretentious as all get out.  And for who knows what reason, really.  It's kind of a dimly lit restaurant/bar that's just as non-descript as any other.  It tries too hard to be what it thinks it is, and doesn't try hard enough to be a good restaurant.With that said, though, some of their food is just out-of-the-ballpark, OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD awesome.  All of their soups (3 cheese and ale, or the tomato basil).  The Havarti and Turkey is lovely, as is the Cuban style pork (tho, I did find a very unappetizing piece of fat in it the very last time I had it, so it kind of put me off it for a while).You can't go wrong with a burger. =)  But, then again, it's a burger, they're not reinventing the airplane.I say... if you want to spend a mint for the possibility of some good food, and then an outrageous bar tab, pick Destihl.  But if you're looking for beer and semi-comparable food, check out Hooters or Buffalo Wild Wings. The same in theory, just a different point-of-view.",

My daughter who lives there is moving to Spain so we are letting her choose whenever we go down for football games and she has been picking some winners.This is a sleek, clean, modern space.  There are beer vats as you enter which add a nice vibe of authenticity.  We were seated right away at a very comfortable table for the four of us.  We tried the deviled eggs app and some gingery egg rolls, we all split them and liked them.  Both had a bit of a kick, the egg roll sauce had the most kick and I found this out after I had drizzled it all over mine but I still enjoyed it immensely, I just drank some extra water.Everyone tried a cup of soup because hey, soup is good food.  I gobbled up every bit of my beer cheese soup, so light and flavorful.  I loved it!  With my swordfish tacos I had an amazing iced tea, it was just a lovely flavorful tea with an orange slice.  The swordfish tacos were divine but if you are a bit of a spice wimp (like me) you might want the guac on the side, that is where the heat was for sure!  I ended up just eating the fish out of the taco, it was just too picante for me!  I adored the rice, bean, corn side dish.  Just delicious!For dessert, we all split a sour cherry bread pudding and I really liked it.  It came with ice cream and it was just smooth, sweet and a bit of tangy with that nice cold creamy spot of the ice cream.  I am not a huge bread pudding fan but I think I could become one!This was a very enjoyable meal.  The team had played lousy, my daughter is moving, I needed a culinary hug and this was it!  I would definitely come back but sadly it won't be with my youngest!  Why don't you meet us so I won't miss her?",

My friend and I arrived a little after 7 on a Friday night and was told the wait would be about 40 minutes since we didn't have reservations. No problem. After only about 20-25 minutes our pager buzzed, so score! So far so good. Our server was really nice and attentive, nothing negative to say about him. However, the food is another story.We started with the cheese curds for an appetizer. And these were awesome, plus they give you a lot. The only part of the meal that really stood out, sadly. I'd had my eye on the strawberry goat cheese salad, so I got that and split the pesto goat cheese pizza. The salad had a lot of potential with all the seemingly good ingredients, but was just off. The spinach tasted wrong and it would have been much better with mixed greens. The \"strawberry\" part of the salad consisted of maybe three tiny pieces and the goat cheese wasn't even very good. It mainly was made up of mandarin oranges and ill-tasting spinach.I'm not a huge fan of wood-fired pizza (I prefer almost any other type of crust). My friend and I split a pizza, but I saw plenty of people putting one away all by themselves. It is very thin. The toppings were ok, but I didn't like how the goat cheese was in big globs instead of spread over the whole pizza.We left without getting dessert, but I saw a few and they are possibly the biggest desserts I've ever seen anywhere. This isn't a good thing. Probably 3-4 people should be splitting on dessert, but I'm guessing that doesn't happen that often. So just be aware if you do order that piece of cake.Besides the service, the other positive is the price. Everything is fairly cheap. But that coincides with the quality, so just beware.",

So, the service is charming and friendly. The menu is chock full of traditional Midwestern fare (aka, everything has some surprise chuck of meat in it). I'll explain. On our first breakfast visit, I ordered the oatmeal and blueberry muffin combo and coffee. The muffin was nice and warm was meant to be shared. The oatmeal was really good, no quick oats here. And I ended up buying a \"ChiChi the Chihuahua \" dog for the car trip. Trust me. It was a good idea.The second trip was more of a brunch and I ordered the \"Midwest Veggie Plate\", with my choice of 4 sides. I chose brown rice, turnip greens, potato wedges and beans. How 3 out of 4 of those dishes had shredded meat that was certainly picked out, will be a mystery to me. Brown rice with shredded meat? Beans with bits of ham? Turnip greens with a sliver of meat. It was like a demented macrobiotic plate. I kind of ate my meal, but with scrutiny. You don't really go to Cracker Barrel...you just kind of end up there. Best enjoyed on road trips with family.",

I was pleasantly surprised to be seated without a wait- it was about 10:45 in the morning and the parking lot was PACKED (post-church crowd?).  But we must have come in at the perfect time because there was one empty, clean table- and it was ours!Our server was very nice, our food came out quickly and tasted great. You know how sometimes when food comes out really fast it tastes old like they made it earlier and waited for someone to order it? This wasn't the case. It was all piping hot and fresh. The odds were ever in our favor.",

You have to order carefully, it is true.  The pork barbecue is good, the rainbow trout is pretty good if not fried, but the main reason to go is the GREENS.  They have flecks of meat in them which is what makes them good.  This is the reason that i like southern cooking.  The biscuits and cornbread are also very good.  I would avoid all other of their meat entrees, particularly their meatloaf which has a really weirdly fluffy and light consistency, as if meat had been aerated and transformed into a different substance with different properties, and the \"chicken n noodles,\" which is like condensed chicken soup from a can, but with extra slime.  Beef stew is a disaster; even the waitress described it as \"fatty.\"  Desserts are insanely huge and can be shared if you are a family of 4.  Three of us all had a go at the apple dumpling and barely made a dent in it. It went back looking more or less the same as when it arrived.  The thing I like the most about this place is its multicultural democratic bent. Despite the downhome theme of this place, which might seem off-putting if you are not a white person from the midwest, I have always had excellent service here.  It is also the only restaurant in our town that I have seen that has both a white and a black clientele (I have never seen Asian people here, except for some people who were clearly part of a bus tour and therefore not there of their own free will).",

All the food is good, esp the hash brown casserole, but we all knew that. I'm reviewing especially for service. Twice now, we've been with parties of at least 10. This past weekend? 14! Both times, we've been seated without much wait (no wait this past weekend...and who would expect no wait for 14...at a breakfast place...on Sunday), been served quickly, been given separate checks without a second word, and just had a totally painless experience. Orders are all correct, food prepared well for what it is. Good times. This past visit...3 of us went to put names in for everyone, expecting a wait, and they pushed a huge table together, and sat the scouting party, letting them just wait for everyone else to show up. All service I guess I wouldn't expect from a run of the mill, always busy breakfast place. So - visit this Cracker Barrel without fear. Order Grandma's French Toast.",

                "review": "Ok.. since the last time I was at this Cracker Barrel (on June 7th, 2012 ... with it's respective awful experience with of not getting a Rib Eye steak cooked to my liking) ... I tried several times over the course of two months following my last visit to register a complaint at the crackerbarrel.com feedback page .. that .. when submitting the feedback.. threw a 'web server 501' error (likely meaning a programming or setup error malfunction on the server prevented the operation from finishing).  Finally, in August 2012, the 501 error was fixed and they received my feedback .. albeit 2+ months late.  They promptly responded in snail mail a FREE 1 PERSON MEAL coupon to be used sometime before 1-13-2013.Well ... today ... Nov 24, 2012 was the day I returned to Cracker Barrel to give them another chance at making a Rib Eye dinner for me.  My girlfriend ordered a Meatloaf meal.Our meals were .. .much much better (at least mine was) than last time.  The Rib Eye was cooked to medium (as I like).  I could use a steak knife and cut it rather easily.  It had good flavor.  I also had cornbread muffins and a baked potato with butter.  Cornbread muffins *always* tend to be a little dry and tend to clump in the back of my throat. Usually I need a drink handy to wash it down as it clumps.My girlfriend really like the meatloaf meal she ordered.  Thought it was a good change from what she considered to be normal.  It was quite tasty and the vegetables she selected were also very good.The only chink in the armor of my meal was the baked potato.  It was very very well cooked (or nuked.. not sure if they use a confection oven or a microwave oven) with the ends of the meat of the potato being very hard (like an over nuked or over baked potato gets) and the skin (which I do eat) was extremely tough.  When I asked the server for a new potato, I said \"the potato's skin cuts like leather\". When coming to that conclusion, it took quite a bit of downward force on the knife to cut through the potato.  A baked potato shouldn't offer so much resistance to being cut.After the server replaced the potato, the replacement was absolutely fine. No problems.The only other chink was service.  Service wasn't spectacular. Generally, I give servers a standing rule that if they see my drink nearing or beyond half full, bring another without asking me.  Eventually, I'll slow down and on my last drink it'll take a long time for me to get down to the halfway mark.  This particular server had a hard time keeping me well lubricated with my Coca Cola. There were many times I waited for the next Coke to arrive for a few minutes.In general, this visit to Cracker Barrel was somewhere near average.  Not great. Not awful.  Had my first baked potato been edible an the server kept me sufficiently lubricated with a constant flow of Coke .. they'd have received 4 stars.  Because it didn't .. this was a great improvement over the last time .. but didn't WOW me.3 stars.",

The service is friendly and efficient.  Prices are reasonable.  Decor very country.  The gift shop has lots of junk and kitsch but upon closer inspection has some items from the past that bring back memories, such as types of candy and snacks.  Also, unlike some places I have breakfasted, they don't make you feel like an oddity because you're dining alone.",

The service is always excellent and the staff is quite friendly - even if their customers have just managed to fanagle a DD to drive them here after a night in campus town.For those of you health conscious, perhaps you can have wheat toast?  That's about the only health alternative here.  So settle down in a booth, order the horseshoe or infamous stack and prepare yourself for a guilty pleasure.My personal favorite is the hangover stack - a bed of hashbrowns, optional biscuit, sausage or hamburger patty, eggs any way you want them, slice of cheese, smothered in artery-clogging country gravy heaven.  It's really the gravy that sets this breakfast delight apart from the rest.  Guaranteed to take the edge off that night of heavy drinking - as if one indulgence weren't enough.",

I've tried a couple of different things, but usually end up with steak and 2 eggs over easy.  Now to be honest, the steak is tough, thin, and overcooked, requiring a healthy dose of A1.

And I'd be a happy man.  Despite being off-campus, this is still the numero uno place to go when you've got that drunken hunger.  The late night staff is great too as long as you're not overly drunk or loud; my friends and I have come in enough that they recognize us, even though some of us have been alumni for a few years now.As noted above, the stack is their signature item (hash browns, meat, cheese, egg, and gravy), which I recommend with sausage (hamburger is too plain) and a biscuit.  An acceptable alternative is the horseshoe burger (toast, cheese fries, burger).(Second note: Make sure you go to this location and not the one in downtown Champaign.  The downtown one is too brightly lit, takes longer to get your food since it holds more people, and doesn't have the same staff or service)",

My special came with a VERY large portion of hash browns.Unfortunately, I had to pay quite a bit extra for the same items I typically get with the special over at IHOP -- 2 eggs, bacon, hash browns, and some pancakes.However, it was worth it to be in a different location with its own ambiance. Feels a bit like you're eating at a diner in a small forgotten town that only has one main road running through it, and the people who stop there don't live there but are just passing through. Or I could be projecting.The staff when I was there was older and not college-aged kids, if that makes a difference to you.",

I was expecting much better, even from a breakfast-all-day diner, because I've raved over similar diners in other review (see: CJ's in Seattle and Izzy & Nat's in Battery Park). However, no. I have no interest in darkening the door of this diner again.I rate diners based on how they deliver on four menu items: their hash, biscuits and gravy, country fried steak, and pancakes. I wasn't able to try Merry-Ann's hotcakes or their steak, so I'm just rating my experience on the hash and biscuits and gravy.Merry-Ann's is a cute, Illini-paraphanalia-ed (is that a word?) diner with overly hovering waitresses and bad orange juice. The booths are teeny and sticky, with an assortment of dairy-free creamer and jam stacked haphazardly on one end. Interesting. But ick. Their $3 orange juice is pulp-less, watered down concentrate.Their hash is AMAZING. It's the reason why I'm giving Merry-Ann's its single star. Crispy yet soft, I could've had platters of this thing. Dripping in ketchup or on its own or mixed with the diner's pepper gravy, oooh the hash is heaven.Biscuits and gravy. Oh gosh. What went wrong? I appreciate the full-size serving, but the biscuits were soggy and the gravy.... I am a fan of sausage gravy in general (I don't discriminate), and I have no qualms of venturing out into the pepper gravy arena, but gravy in general should be thick and flavorful and not congeal and as awesome as it could be. Merry-Ann's does not know how to make a good gravy. It was flavorless and milky and the only reason I even ate it was because I mixed it with the aforementioned fabulous hash browns.Sigh. Oh well. Am still on the search for a great breakfast nook in Champaign. Any suggestions?",

                "review": "merry ann's will always hold a special place in my heart, as evidenced by my making it my first review.  at the corner of neil and kirby, just on the edge of the illinois campus, it was one of my favorite places back when i went to school there.  you might be thinking, \"really, diner food for one of your favorites?\"  partly.don't get me wrong - it's not the best food I've ever had.  i mean c'mon man, it's a diner for goodness sake.  but if i'm ever in the mood for diner food, give me merry ann's over ihop any day.  but it's about more than just the food - i'll get to that in a second but first my review.  when i ate here, i really only ordered one of two things: the #1 and the diner stack.  ahh yes...the stack.  two eggs any style, sausage patties or burger, slice of cheese, served on a bed of hash browns, over your choice of biscuits or not, covered in a generous ladling of sausage gravy.i get mine over-easy, with biscuits, and the hamburger patty (because it felt heartier than the sausage patties and went better with the cheese, plus you get bits of sausage in the gravy anyway.)  top it off with some black pepper and about 10 plops of tabasco, and i'm good to go.i've seen the stack ordered with over-medium (a solid choice and they make them well here) or scrambled (though i prefer the runny yolk.)  the hash browns are your regular frozen kind, but somehow the cook always gets a good mix of soft and crispy, even under all that gravy.  i prefer the burger, but my wife favors the sausage patties and a side of toast in place of the biscuits because it's less heavy.  but the key to the diner stack is the gravy.  i've never seen them actually make it, but they always seem to have a vat of it readily available.  it looks real thick, but goes down surprisingly smooth.  now i understand the phrase, \"and it's all gravy,\" because it tastes amazing and goes great with however you build your stack.  any way you order it really, it's a thing of breakfast beauty.  i will never stop touting the glory of the diner stack at merry ann's.if you're not in the mood to miraculously gain two pounds, then i recommend the #1: two eggs, choice of bacon, ham, sausage links or patties, hash browns, and toast.  traditional.  plain.  simple.  delicious.  and you might only gain one pound.the other reason i hold this place in such high regard?  the memories.  the people, the conversation, the bonding.  all of it.  i was introduced to merry ann's by upperclassmen who used to come here and just talk about stuff.  just you and some friends fitting no more than four to a booth and talking about life, about school, about what lay ahead, and bonding over a stack and a smoke (back when you could smoke in restaurants.)  as a student, you couldn't get to merry ann's unless you had a car (which i didn't) so it meant something to me when i would be invited to join them.  when you're young and a few hundred miles from home and living by yourself for the first time, it was nice to have a place where you can open up or just sit back and enjoy conversation.i've spent many a good time and never a bad time here.  i enjoyed everything about it.  i liked that it was 24-hours, so you could head over after the bars closed, or in the middle of the afternoon (i've done both, and maybe once or twice during regular breakfast hours.)  i liked the fast and friendly service, which it was for the most part.  i liked that they always asked if we wanted our checks split.  i liked that townies ate here; made from bits of real townie, so you know it's good.  i liked the menus that never changed, except for when they got laminated.  i liked watching the cooks assemble a stack like an artist at work.  i liked sitting on the left side a little more than sitting on the right - don't know why.i leave you now with a couple of do's and don'ts for merry ann's; some words of wisdom if you will.  do eat here.  do not judge it until you do.  do try the diner stack at least once.  do not box or take it to-go (it won't be the same.)  do make sure at least the driver is sober enough to make the drive here.  do not eat all by your lonesome (invite someone.)  do expect to wait for a table (and if there's no wait then it's all gravy - see what i did there?)  do not go there to study.  do respect the staff and other patrons.  do not overstay and take up a booth if there's a long wait formed.  do tip well.  do not sit in silence.  do engage in good conversation.  do NOT talk about fight club.  and do come back now, ya hear?so many words for a little diner in central illinois.  i promise future reviews won't go this in-depth or off-tangent, but this was more about paying homage to friends, to this place, and to memories from way back when.  i know to some, it's just a diner.  not me.  yeah it was far.  yeah it was never really clean.  yeah it was just diner food.  but to me it was more than just that.  the time i spent at merry ann's was always...comforting.",

Very attentive friendly and helpful! This is a classic nostalgic diner where the server comes right to the side of your table to take your order. The menu itself is quite limited to basic breakfast items such as eggs, hash browns, sausage, burgers, sandwiches, and salad. I went with the house specialty dish the diner stack that has (hash Browns topped with cheese, hamburger or sausage patties, two eggs, and then smothered with delicious sausage gravy) I missed the part of the menu where it said smothered... The dish had so much gravy on it that you could not make out the food underneath. The hashbrown were oily, no real crispy to it. The sausage and eggs were good without complaint. Overall with the oil and salt, it was somewhat difficult to eat. I think if they changed some of the options to other more contemporary diner foods they maybe better off. I had high expectations, but the food just as other reviewers wrote falls flat.Pros: friendly service, cleanCons: the food really is below par, salty and very greasy not in a good diner kind of wayHidden deals:Monday to Friday 6 am to 11 am2 eggs, 2 pancakes, 2 ham for 3.99Ham omelet 3.99All day specials Mon-ThursSuper burger 4.40Grilled ham and cheese 4.00",

I can't recommend it.Merry-Ann's menu, decor and layout, and overall look and feel, are identical to that of a Waffle House franchise. I suspect that this diner was designed to duplicate the successful Waffle House model. All of the menu items, from the coffee, eggs, and omelets down to toast and sweet rolls, are poor, although some items are a notch better, namely mediocre. Service is roughly comparable to that of other Waffle House stores. Ditto for the decor, and, in fact, the actual floor layout.Prices are low in absolute terms but they are somewhat high for the types of menu selections offered, quality aside. (And the quality delivered is mostly poor.)Before the Hilton-Garden Inn took over the property across the street, there was a well-regarded breakfast restaurant, almost a Champaign institution, attached to the property. The Hilton razed the restaurant as part of its renovation. Too bad. The Merry-Ann Diner is not suitable for breakfast at any time of day.",

My friend ordered the grilled cheese with fries and I ordered a chicken sandwich and fries.  Her grilled cheese was basically a piece of American cheese on white bread. That's it. I've made better grilled cheese at home using the same ingredients. There wasn't really much to my chicken sandwich either. Overall, nothing special. I don't understand the rave reviews of this place at all.  Maybe the breakfast is better? Too bad, I won't be returning. Also, I noticed a sign that said NO STUDYING. I guess they want you to just eat your crappy food and GET OUT. The location in downtown Champaign seems nicer, but I haven't been in because of the horrible experience I had at the other location. Might give it a try to see if it's any better.",

However, everything is a couple bucks more than I would like to be paying for greasy diner food.I think the final straw with me was when I ordered a chicken tender plate only to receive chicken nuggets that definitely came out of the freezer: uniform inside texture, only vaguely reminiscent of chicken.  I'm pretty picky about mechanically separated chicken.  Maybe that's snooty, but I just hate it.  In any case, for how much I paid I expected something a little better than that.For late night food, you're better off making it yourself or even going to Steak 'n Shake.",

Our waitress acted like she had better things to do than to take our order. When our orders arrived my husband ate about 80% of his but explained that the flavor was \"lacking\" and that his food was \"very greasy\". My order was virtually inedible...literally only ate a couple of bites and was unable to stomach anymore of it due to the horrible flavor and excessive grease. The two best things about our meal was our coffee and getting the bill so that we could leave. The restaurant itself was dirty. The only positive thing that I would guess that this diner is good for is a hangover fix...unfortunately we weren't hungover college kids and were actually expecting a good meal, which did not happen.",

The country fried steak patty was chopped formed, deep fried, and covered with a gravy dry mix, which also covered the potatoes. The peas were from a can. Haven't eaten there since.",

Merry-Ann's satisfied all of my breakfast cravings and then some. I had the #1 combo - 2 eggs, hash browns, bacon and toast. I also got a half-order of gravy and a biscuit, plus a coffee. The bacon was by far the most disappointing part of the meal. It was just flavorless and gross. Everything else made up for it, though. My eggs were done perfectly (sunny-side-up), the hash browns were crispy, and the biscuit and gravy was just the right amount of spicy. Two people had a good, filling breakfast for around $14 before tip, which rocks. Pros: Everything except the bacon and the awkward time when we had to stand around and wait for a table to open up. Oh, also, I wish they had Heinz ketchup.",

I loved coming here all the time in College to do some homework in the morning and get breakfast. The ladies who worked in Urbana side were always very friendly and remembered faces/ orders. At one point they would give me coffee on the house and whip up my order before I even placed it! I know they have 24/7 breakfast, but since I lived in Champaign, I never was apart of the crews who would come in at 3am and much away.Naturally, when visiting for the summer, I had to go back to Merry Ann's with a few friends and grab hangover brunch. This time, we went to the Merry Ann's on Neil street. The diner on Neil is definitely smaller than the one in Urbana and was much, much more busy/crowded. Still, the waitress was very friendly, and I know I enjoyed my meal! We didn't feel rushed at all to finish, even though the line was out the door and we felt bad if we kept staying around just to talk/ get more coffee. Unless you're looking at somewhere like Le Peep to get brunch with your parents, I highly suggest Merry Ann's since it is a staple at U of I.",

I would eat breakfast food every meal of the day if I didn't mind putting on 20 pounds (trying to go in the opposite direction, actually: new years resolution, you see =\\).  Merry-Ann's has AMAZING breakfast food.  Ergo, I love Merry-Ann's!  Everytime I go, I make sure to get The Dinner Stack (everything you could want for breakfast dumped together and then smothered in sausage gravy), or their Super Burger (sometimes with a side of cheese fries even though I know the burger itself fills me up... what can I say?  Thirsty impairs my judgement).Breakfast isn't all that Merry-Ann's does well; they have all the typical diner food (juicy burgers, grilled sandwiches, cheese fries, milk shakes, etc.) - but better.Open 24 hours a day with almost most things on the menu only around $5, you'll be able to get that extra drink or two at the bars/club.",

One friend got the \"mega omlet\" [sic] for $7 which was pretty tasty.  The food was mostly plain and bland; I mean, it's hard to screw up scrambled eggs and hash browns, but it just wasn't that great.  Even the toast was more flavorless than regular toast (how is that even possible?).  But the pancakes were delicious--fluffy and wonderful.  The orange juice was terrible.  We saw the waitress mixing up a big jug of it from concentrate and water out of the soda machine.  It was room temperature when she served it.  Yuck.  Good times, though.  It's a diner.  Word of warning to you U of I students--there is a one-hour table maximum from 9-3 (that's a.m. AND p.m.).",

I would probably prefer to come for breakfast, but that wasn't in the cards today.The service was very good. Our waitress was polite, food came in a reasonable time, and drinks were refilled regularly. We were also brought our check in a speedy manner, which I always like.Food: I had a buffalo chicken wrap, my wife had a hamburger and my son had a reuben sandwich and fries. All the food was very good.The only negative is the scrum at the front door/register when you are on the waiting list or paying your bill. Of course, part of the charm of Courier is the old time feeling the place gives, and a large waiting room would probably detract from that.Next trip: breakfast!",

Wonderbread with an anorexic serving of meat and a pickle spear for $8 or more.We had to get up and walk around to find an employee who would take our money. The couple next to us got up and left because nobody would take their order.Inexcusably bad service, inexplicably bad food. Come on, Urbana, for once, accept the fact that some businesses are meant to die. In case you don't get out much, the Courier Cafe is terrible. They are operating as if they have no competition.Suffering through a shit sandwich and bad service is a stupid way of supporting local business. Unless you're into self-punishment and leather and... you know, in that case, join the priesthood.",

I don't know to describe to be Old Victorian but it is old school for sure. The seats are all wood, wooden floors, dim lighting, classic wooden benches, and there is even an old school cash register. Definitely a blast in the past to the early 20th century. Very classy and clean place that had a warm, home feeling.The food? What can I say. AMAZING. It is just simple, American, home-cooking! I have had just about everything from the awesome burgers (which come in a ton of different ways), steak sandwich, soups, deep fried shrimp, most of the pies, and the sundaes. Best of all, it's all fairly cheap!The service was also awesome! I went here with a large party of nearly 20 people and I went here with just 3. Both times the service was amazing. There is this elderly guy there with glasses and he is just very nice, funny, and personable to us every time.I have made this a regular place for me to go when I am in the Urbana-Champaign area.",

Very friendly waittresses !!  The only place I can think of that competes with it in terms of a Venue is a cafe near the old train station, but I think that closed 2 decades ago ...This is a popular late-night place to go after Contra Dancing in Crystal Lake Park, or even dancing at the Regent ballroom.

The first time I ordered food it was breakfast and my pancakes, both buckwheat and normal, were terribly dry, the eggs were overcooked and tasted like oil, the coffee tasted instant and the price was not cheap like others seem to imply. The second, unfortunate, visit I had some sort of catfish fry which again was covered in grease and was somewhat dry with no real taste of its own, I drowned it in sauce to eat it. The biggest problem, and one I notified them of, was the \" soup\" they were serving that day. The menu listed a creamy corn soup but what arrived was a watery, yet clumpy, mass of starch with bits of tasteless bacon, which I don't eat by the way,  and pieces of canned corn masquerading as soup. I was really disappointed and upset, mainly with the food but neither the, really unfriendly, waitress nor the hostess gave a damn. I'm never coming back; just because something has been around for a long time it does not mean that this thing is good, and that's the case with this cafe.",

The black bean burger while not terrible, just wasn't for me. It was really bloated and mushy which made it difficult to eat. I had to just eat it with a fork. I'm used to something a little more dense and solid like a burger would be. The salad bar was delicious. REALLY great selection and everything was fresh. My one complaint would be that I'm 5 ft 6in, which is not really that short, and it was really difficult to reach toppings and their \"sneeze guard/window\" apparatus is really awkward. But it's worth the hassle. You go up and get your salad, they weigh it and you give the ticket to the sever. I got a very large salad for about $5.  Love this place. Great ambience, great food.",

We wanted to eat something homemade and different (and not occupied by college students), but our experience was just on par.  The ambiance of the place is that straight from a vintage movie.  We waited a while to be seated even though many of the tables were unoccupied (possibly because the host was also the cashier ringing people up as they finished their meals).  As soon as we were seated, I quickly noticed that some of my silverware had dried food stuck and even my elbows stuck to the sticky table.  We ordered the steak and eggs, which lacked seasoning.   The service wasn't too bad.  We had a very friendly waitress, who tried her best to ensure we would enjoy our experience.",

A few days ago, I went with my friend and our two kids (baby and a 2 year old). I got there and stood at the top of the steps for, no joke, 10 minutes before the host even acknowledged me. But they were swamped and I gave him the benefit of the doubt. I've worked in food service. When he finally asked if I \"needed something,\" I was confused. The sign clearly says, \"Please wait to be seated.\" I told him I was waiting for a table, and he said, \"Oh, there's one down there,\" and pointed towards the kitchen. My friend and I took our seats, and the host brought a high chair. Someone brought us water, and another 10 minutes later, our frazzled, odd server came to our table. She asked if we were ready to order, and we looked down and said, \"Well.... we never got any menus....\" She came back with the menus, blamed it on someone else, and we ordered our food. Every time she came to the table, she had some sort of snide comment -- maybe she was just having a bad day or that's her personality, but it was annoying. It would have helped if she would have ever brought us refills, checked to be sure we liked our food, asked if we needed anything else. At the end of the meal, she said, \"Gosh your table is so quiet,\" which we both laughed at. How would she know? She never stopped by!The food, however, was fine. I ordered a Dagwood Sandwich (after the hostess said, \"Well, that's a LOT of food,\" and I politely responded, \"OK and I'll also have a side of fries.\") I got the sandwich with just mustard, no secret sauce or mayo, and it's was pretty good (it was a tall sandwich). I shared the sandwich and fries with my 2 year old. We had a few fries left over, to give you an idea of how much food it ended up being.The bill was about $10 -- on the high end for lunch, but considering it was a large lunch, it seems pretty reasonable.Lunch was fine, but I think I will stick with breakfast at the Courier. They seem too overwhelmed at lunch!",

What I got in return was the bland little sad looking piece of fish about the size of a playing card. It was cod. It was flavorless. It was served with thin slices of lemon on top of it. It served no purposes other than to falsely suggest there would be some lemon-y taste. Also on the plate were three slices of cucumber and a slice of tomato. Not sure why. Perhaps it was there so that I could rate which item was the most bland on the plate.I have been to courier cafe a few times, and I've always ordered some sort of burger or sandwich. They always came out as expected for a sandwich. It tasted good and it was filling. This on the other hand, left me disappointed as I compared the value and price of my meal against my friend who ordered a sandwich that costed less. I left the restaurant hungry and actually went to another nearby restaurant to eat again.",

I had a courier burger (burger with bacon) with fries and coleslaw. I really appreciate how they put the burger toppings on the side of the plate, because it lets you assemble the burger however you want to, and makes the dish more presentable. The burger came out very neat and clean; I didn't have to deal with a sauce-filled, drippy mess, like some other places. It was all very appetizing, though nothing to write home about. I would avoid the coleslaw, however, which was disastrously drenched in mayonnaise, and after a few bites, I just set it to the side untouched. I totally dig the antique-style decor in this restaurant. This is one of Urbana's landmark establishments; if you're looking for a place to enjoy a cozy meal with friends, definitely make a trip over here.",

The other reviewers have summated the greatness of this place pretty well, so I'll just add in how great the prices are. I had a rib-eye steak sandwich, iced tea, and a mocha milkshake for about $13. I could not eat another bite the rest of that Saturday Night, phenomenal. The ambiance is also great, the building feels very \"homey\" with all the wood paneling and old-school wallpaper.SO,go, eat, and drink milkshakes: for places such as the Courier are getting harder and harder to find!",

Our party of 5 was placed at a table by the front window, which was so cold, being next to the door. Not to difficult to crank up the heat to compensate!Our order consisted of 2 burgers, Broiled pork tenderloin, fish tacos, and white meat fried chicken.The courier burger was alright, but not really anything phenomenal. My mother had the broiled pork tenderloin, which I tasted and it had a good flavor to it. My wife had the fish tacos, which she liked. My sister ordered the fried chicken but she said it was nothing special and she could do better at home. The time spent waiting for our food was pretty unreasonable. More than a half hour spent waiting on food to arrive to our table, which feels much longer when you are freezing cold(we kept our coats on and were still cold).The fried chicken apparently was the item that held up our table. You would think with the amount of time they took, they would have gotten it right, but you would be wrong. It was supposed to be all white meat, but instead was a breast, thigh, and leg. The waitress said they must have mixed them up in the back. We took this as \"I grabbed the wrong plate\" but after another 5-10 minutes she hadn't come back. When she finally did come back, there was no offer to get what was ordered, but instead she offered to take a cheeseburger off our bill.So rather than make it right, we got \"go ahead and eat the thing ya didn't want, and we'll comp the cheeseburger your son ordered.\"My sister started to eat the breast and on the 2nd bite almost puked right there at the table as she had bitten into a long black hair that was laced into the batter.At that point we alerted our waitress. The manager came over and said he would make the chicken dinner free and put the cheeseburger back on our bill.\"Damn right you'll make it free, she had two bites and refuses to eat it!\"So she had essentially no dinner and was not offered anything else except a free desert. It's been about 10 years since I'd been to the Courier and I don't think I'll ever be going back again. We really should have waited in line for some of the amazing BBQ on the next street over.If ya don't mind freezing, waiting forever for your food, getting the wrong order, and then finding hair in it... Yea, go try Courier Cafe",

We pointed this out to the staff and later someone came by and took it out of our way.  Several minutes later another waitress  approached our  table, interrupted boyfriend and me mid conversation and accused us of taking \"her money\". Later she was hanging out by the cash register area counting all of her singles proudly with no regard to other customers waiting to be served. I found this beyond rude... the staff needs to learn to work together more and communicate  better, and they need to hire employees  that can at least pretend that they like their job, not just the money. Food was good, but I was too  frustrated  by this  experience  to enjoy  it for all that it had the potential  to be.",

It has never been so bad. The only reason why we placed 2 stars is because of the food.-(Money-saving Mystery Butter blend) On numerous occasions when we dined here, we had a very hard time getting an order in. When ordering a plate, the waitress was cold and stern. We asked her to bring plain butter rather than their money-saving \"mystery butter blend\", and she was making a face and saying \"Oh I'm not sure I can do that\", despite the fact that they have pure butter at hand. She was selective about who she served and was overall rude.-(Kicking customers out the door) Then Chuck, the manager, and his waitress came up to our table well before closing hour and started moaning about how he is closing soon and was trying to kick us out in advance!-(Ignoring customers) The last time we came here, we sat outside as the waitress Nicole was serving someone else. Although we said \"hi\", *she blatantly ignored us* and we had to walk into the restaurant and talk to the manager JUST TO PLACE OUR ORDER. It was so bad. We watched the manager baby-sit the waitress as he told her \"you have customers waiting for you, Nicole.\"But she had seen us before and consciously ignored us.A few minutes after we came back out to dine outside, Nicole (the waitress) walked towards us and gave us a very phony smile. -(Insolent manager) On this other occasion, Chuck (The Manager) was chatting with us after dinner and he called my friend a \"Liar\" simply because he was trying to get him to guess where we were from. He also called us \"Disingenuous\" for the same reason.-(Summary) Overall, The Courier Cafe has great food, but due to a grumpy and harassing Manager, and rude waitresses who need to be *told* that they have tables waiting for them, we are strongly considering never dining there again.",

The restaurant owners have done a nice job keeping the historic feel while not going tacky.We were there for breakfast. I've heard lunch and dinner are so-so. Our breakfasts were all very good: fresh, tasty and good portions. Nothing that makes you call it the best you ever had, but great basic food nonetheless. I'll go back for breakfast at the Courier next time I'm in town.Have to say the service was outstanding: super friendly, fast, unobtrusive.

But when I come here by myself, the waitresses are pretty rude as well as the hostess.  I came here yesterday, and there were two tables that were full.   The hostess made me wait while she tallied up a stack of paperwork --- didn't seem to bother her that I'm 5 months pregnant and would've been more comfortable seated.  After I was seated, it took the waitress 5 minutes to come over and get my order.  No hellos or how are yous..... just \"what do you want?\"  By that point, other patrons had come in and she seemed perky and friendly with them.  My food came out fairly fast, but my burger was underseasoned and overcooked.  At that point I just wanted to get out.  So I had to flag my now-chatty waitress who was paying attention to every other table and asked for my check, which she just slammed down on my table.   I didn't even bother leaving a tip nor will I ever return again.",

The decor has literally not changed in decades, and suits it well.For this visit, the wife and I ate small. She had a quesadilla with sweet potato fries (chips, actually) and I had the potato skins along with a ham and cheese.Funny thing about their sandwiches. The inside is warm, but the bread is soft, not toasted. That was strange. The potato skins have changed, and I think this must depend on who is cooking. I didn't like these as much as the old ones. The old version was literally potato \"boats\". The new version are more like fries. I was told the quesadilla was only fair, not great. I ordered the phosphate as always, and it was a little bland.Maybe they need to up the quality of their food again. I wouldn't rush to go back as I always have.",

(you know... the stuff you usually rinse off thoroughly.)the service is generally fantastic.  a lot of their wait staff is attentive and friendly, especially in the morning.  there are some night staff that seem to forget you exist, but for the most part, it's decent service.  all in all, if your vegetarian or vegan, there are options, which is difficult to find for a sit down meal in this town and don't feel like having sushi or lo mein.  i would give it 4/5 but just because the quality of some things ... like service and salad bar... is hit or miss.",

It was a splurge for me then, though I'm sure that the prices were as low as they are today. Now, it was time to bring my niece here, the night before she registered for her classes and we took a tour of my old abode, Allen Hall, which is now her casa for the next year.  And I guess it was our lucky day: I tried the coin-op crane and scooped up a prize, she got to chew the gummy fruits of my lucky labor. I had the quesadilla, which was large and tasty. Don't expect it to have the authenticity of Mxico; I wouldn't expect it to in a place so resplendent in Americana. But the American adaptation was a treat.Near a campus that has changed from mom & pop restaurants, it's very much worth the trek to get some home-style cooking in a historic, small business.",

Sunday morning brunch after V-day with the boy seemed like a good option. It was pretty hoppin and the inside was just what I expected it to be: very cute and eclectic, smattered with antiques (but not in the Cracker Barrel way.. in the authentic way), and cozy. Because the menus on the website don't say when breakfast ends and lunch begins, we weren't sure if we would have the option of choosing from either menu. We got there at around 11:35, and the hostess gave us menus with just breakfast. The menus are large, so if you take a while to decide (especially during brunch time...) be careful. Our waitress stopped by once immediately after we were seated to get our drink orders, and once about five minutes later. We told her we needed a few minutes. She came back shortly after and snapped at us, saying that they were only serving breakfast for 5 more minutes so we needed to order then. This was at around 11:45. I understand wanting to expedite things, but if the switch was happening at 11:50 shortly after we arrived, I think we should have been told by the waitress or the hostess that lunch was about to start (after we had been seated I saw people ahead of us getting salads and soups, but no lunch option was given to us). Anyway, he got the breakfast burrito and I got the breakfast sandwich. His was very good and enormous! The salsa verde was perfect.. I didn't even know I liked salsa on eggs. I think I just misordered in my haste. The croissant was not from their bakery.. it had the \"I came out of a cellophane wrapped plastic container from Sam's\" taste, but it was large.. just not a real croissant. The eggs were another problem: they were a consistent yellow color and had rounded borders. Not real scrambled eggs.. or maybe real but reconstituted. The bacon was tasty, the hashbrowns mushy. Not worth $7. He gave me half of his burrito in exchange for half of mine. I greatly benefited from the unfair trade! I really want to like this place, so I'll try it again in the next few weeks! Hopefully I'll get a smiley waitress. FYI: prices are a little higher than those listed on the online menu (but only about 50-60 cents).",

This is a delightful little restaurant, done up in turn of the century decor, with fun antiques and pieces from that time period. We were in for breakfast this morning...I was told to go early or wait, and I'm glad we arrived before 8 am, as there was a line when we left an hour later. Service here is cheerful, friendly and professional, and both the hostess and waitress greeted us when we entered. We skipped the homemade pastries and muffins, as they're not on the diet right now, but they looked great. I had an omelet with spinach, mushrooms and cheddar and it was very good, with very fresh veggies. The hash browns they serve are delicious...crispy without and fluffy within. They make their own bread and I tried the cinnamon toast, which was a white bread that my baker husband says was brioche dough, and made for some great toast. He tried the oatmeal with fresh berries and walnuts, which was made with whole oats. The regular size is a very good sized serving of oats...you can get a half order if you're appetite is smaller. I asked of they use real butter...I'll order my toast dry before I'll eat margarine...and she assured me they do, which I greatly appreciate. Two thumbs way up for this delish breakfast. I'll be back for lunch.",

Ensconsed in an old building in downtown Urbana, Courrier Cafe is definitely a cut above the typical restaurants in U of I's hometown.  We were pleasantly surprised.  My wife had the 'Ham and Scram' and a side of pumpkin pancakes that were on special.  The eggs were well cooked and the ham was really tasty.  It had the right hint of smokines which I thought was particularly pleasant.  I had the Spanish omlette which, as usually happens in gringo joints, was billed as 'hot' by our waitress.  It was merely low-medium.  Generous shots of hot sauce kicked my dish up to the real heat level for me.  Delicious coffee and really nice bread that made excellent toast was also provided.  Attentive service (but the restaurant only had ten patrons when we were there - right at opening) so it may not be representative.Not worth a special trip to Champaign-Urbana, but if you are in town or even passing by, a slight detour to patronize it is worth it.",

Don't come if you have more than four people, it'll be next to impossible to keep you all together. However, I think Courier's still a great cozy place to get your grub on.",

Old fashioned soda fountain favorites like phosphates and malt shakes make this place unique, but nearly everything is good. Sandwiches are on fresh bread,  and burgers are thick and hearty. There are a lot of vegetarian options- my favorite is the pesto grilled swiss on sourdough. I also love the ham melt on a fresh croissant. For dessert I recommend sharing a headliner, a monstrously delicious sundae drenched in hot fudge.For the quality of food you get, this place is actually a bargain. I'd prefer it over most of CU's \"fine dining\" establishments any day. Service can be slightly slow, but overall this is one of my favorite places to enjoy after a difficult test or a arduous paper-writing spree.",

The burgers are classic - simple, no frills, good meat, fresh toppings, cooked to perfection. I'd also highly recommend the brunch menu here. Alas, it was a rare occasion that I would be awake for it but you can learn from my mistakes and get yourself some delicious brunch at Courier.For such a historic building, Courier Cafe has done a great job of preserving the past and giving people a taste of the olden times.",

We have been to the Courier so many times over the years that we don't even need menus anymore. We were greeted as soon as we entered and noticed the restaurant was really clean. No tables with empty plates or spilled food under the tables. We were seated, given menus and glasses of ice water. We ordered our usual meals, my wife had a turkey croissant sandwich with french fries and I had a dagwood sandwich on white bread. We shared an order of potato skins which they call \"Skinny Dippers Deep\" which are fried potato skins covered with cheese, bacon, sour cream, and chives. They were awesome and filling, even with two people sharing the skinny dippers, we didn't really have that much room left for our sandwiches. My wife ate half of her sandwich and took the rest of it home. I took my whole sandwich home and had it for dinner. Was looking forward to getting a peanut butter cookie from the case near the register, but they were sold out. Their peanut butter cookies are about the size of your whole hand. All in all, they had a clean restaurant, fast & friendly staff, and great food, what else can you ask for?",

The food is American: sandwiches, burgers, soups, salads, and also more serious entrees. I was going to go for the salmon, but my waitress talked me out of it, so I ended up getting the pork chops, which came with soup. The soup was black bean soup: it was actually quite tasty, and the portion was huge (I expected just a small bowl, since it was supposed to be a side). I was almost full after finishing the soup and when the pork chops arrived, and that was a good thing because I was not too impressed by them... grilled pork chops lathered in bbq sauce, really nothing too exceptional, and the little side of salad that came with it didn't even have any dressing. So... the portion were huge, it was pretty cheap (I think I ended up paying under $15 including a soda), but the food did not impress me much. The service however was pretty friendly. I tried going again for brunch on a Sunday morning, but gave up when I saw the line... I guess it gets quite crowded on the weekend, which is generally a good sign, so I'll have to give it another try for brunch.",

The roasted corn and poblano chowder was absolutely delicious.  I wanted to stop by the nearest U of I frat house and borrow a beer bong to take down a vat of this soup--yea, it was that good!  Overall, the Courier Cafe just feels kind of old (kind of like the burgers taste), but, do yourself a favor and order a giant bowl of that soup!",

                "review": "The other night, my girlfriend and I went out to the Courier Cafe in downtown Urbana. Having been there before, I knew that it was a good place to go for a relatively cheap meal (which is why I capitulated rather quickly). Courier Cafe is one of the older restaurants in downtown Urbana, having been open since 1980. As such, it has outlasted many other downtown Urbana businesses, and enshrined their memory in the names of its burgers.Speaking of burgers, they are the primary reason I go to the Courier Cafe. Burgers are around $5-6, and are 1/3 of a pound. The burgers also tend to be higher quality than the standard pub fare, considering people go there for food, instead of ordering a burger as an afterthought.On this night I opted for the Darcy's burger, which is a burger with mushrooms and bleu cheese. The burger comes on a plate with all of the other assorted toppings, including onions, tomatoes, lettuce, and pickles, off to the side, so you can add them to taste. The burger comes well done unless you specify otherwise. The meat itself is relatively juicy for being a grilled burger, and the bun tastes more like it came from a genuine bakery, instead of a store-brand 8 pack of buns, which often ends up being the case in burger restaurants.Another thing Courier is known for is its old-style sweet drinks, such as its phosphates and New York egg creme drinks. These are sugary soda-type drinks with flavored syrup, with the egg creme being a phosphate with an egg cracked into it and creme added. Courier also has a variety of ice cream desserts.Courier's wine and beer menu is not very extensive, but they have had Rogue Dead Guy on draft for $4 the last few times I have gone, which is cheaper than most bars in the area. In addition, their bottled beers are relatively cheap, and the wine by the glass is inexpensive as well. Though the menu is not extensive, there is a good enough variety to please most individuals.For two people with burgers, drinks, and one order of fries, the total bill ended up being $18.84. This is much lower than one would pay for an equivalent meal anywhere else, even a place like Murphy's (which has a similar food menu, though lower quality food). Courier is a perfect spot for a cheap date, where your date won't know you're being cheap unless you let her see the check.",

For those of you that aren't familiar, the chocolate egg cream, originating in New York (as far as I've heard), contains milk (not cream), chocolate syrup, and seltzer. That's right, no egg. The egg creams at Courier are delicious, however, you should all know, they are NOT authentic egg creams as they contain egg whites to help the top foam up. At any rate, very few places these days have egg creams, so it's great that this place still does. (But if nowhere near you has them and you want to try, they're way easy to make. My version: Fill a glass 1/3 with milk, add syrup til liquid height is 1/2 up the class, fill the rest of the way with seltzer, stir, taste, add more syrup if you wish!)",

In the meantime I discovered that there was also a hair in the sandwich.  I eventually managed to flag him down and asked about the bread.  He took it back to the kitchen and when he came back, told me that they were out of the bread I ordered.  Ok...so why didn't someone come out and ask me what I wanted instead, rather than just making it with something else and hoping I wouldn't notice?  Seems pretty straightforward.  I got a new sandwich and by that time my boyfriend was almost done eating.After that, our waiter never bothered even stopping by our table again to check in, other than walking by to drop off the check.Sandwich was good (...the second one, sans hair) although the \"special sauce\" appeared to just be a mustard...maybe they were out of that too.",

While yes the place is technically a diner, it's really the only one I've ever seen that could be said to offer some historical interest as well; as the back of the menu describes in detail, the place used to be the home of the Courier Newspaper. Much of the decor hanging on the walls has some historical significance, which was so cool! Perfect place to bring an out-of-towner.The food was really delicious. I ordered a Spanish omelette, which was HUGE and came with potatoes and a choice of homemade bread (I chose sourdough bread). The potatoes came diced, and were fried slightly soft--almost like very very tender McDonalds hashbrowns. Not my preferred breakfast potato style, but I'll take it!! The omelette was my favorite part--stuffed with fresh jalapenos, onions, chorizo, and Chihuaha cheese. And so cheap, too! 8-ish bucks for a very generous meal.But the best part of the meal: the truly great service (particularly in contrast to the brunch experience I had had just the day before elsewhere, in Champaign). I don't remember her name, but our waitress just beamed amiable Midwest charm, and was very competent about getting us refills and keeping us apprised of the status of our dishes when there was a bit of a wait to get our food. My friend who brought us to this place has stories of how this same waitress would bring her hot tea with lemon when she was feeling ill.I believe it. And I'd gladly come back next time.",

I went with the \"Monkey Stuff\" sandwich - this sweet, delectable sandwich of tasty sugary goodness. This sandwich would have been way better had the bread been toasted. By the end I just felt like I was eating a mush of sugar. To counteract this sugar, I also ordered from the salad bar. I liked the layout of the Salad Bar - you pay $0.38 per oz of salad you get, so I had a filling salad to go with my sweet sandwich for only $2.50! Not a very diverse salad bar, but I was fairly pleased.The other members of my party enjoyed their meal just fine, but we didn't feel this was anything special. The decor of the restaurant is very vintage, so it ;s kind of dark and has a different feel to it. After reading the reviews, I'm bummed I didn't order a milkshake! I don't know that we'd necessarily make a special trip to come back here.",

A really simple burger, but it was delicious and the potato wedges were hot and plentiful. My friends loved their meal options including the black bean soup and salad.

Given the lack of customers, service was pretty slow. There were only a few menus for us to look at, and the ones that we got were covered with crayon and torn-- but the waitress was nice.My friends got the gazpacho but they said that it was fermented (i.e.,  old). I tried it and thought the same, WTH? I got the Courier burger-- simple bacon cheeseburger with fries. The burger was huge but it was extremely dry like sandpaper. I hate putting ketchup and mustard on a  burger, but I had to just to get the moisture back in my mouth! The fries are NOT fries, they're potato wedges. Have you ever been to Mcdonalds? Fries should look and taste like that. Com'on.I then got The Headliner (two scoops of ice cream with fudge, peanuts, whip cream and a cherry). It was okay, but nothing spectacular-- Joe Schmo who lives out in the dumpster could've made it...probably faster too. Given that we were one of the few groups in the restaurant, it took way too long to make it. Courier Cafe is overrated.",

Let me say that neither was really that good, especially the pesto pita.  The presentations of the food left something to be desired. The one thing that was tasty on the menu was the chocolate peanut butter shake. Not sure if a shake really has the ability to bring me back to a restaurant, and in this case it doesn't.

I asked her to investigate some places we could get brunch, and she found Courier Cafe.  She said one of her girlfriends said it was really good.So, we got there and put our name in.  The restaurant is small, but homey, lots of antiques, reminded me of being at my grandma's old house.  We waited for maybe 20 minutes for a table.When we sat, we were given lunch menus.  When I inquired as to if they were still serving breakfast, one person said \"I don't know, let me check,\" one said \"no\" and the hostess came over and explained that we would've had to have been there by 11:45 to get on the \"breakfast waiting list.\"  It would've been nice if someone explained this to us when we got there, because 2 of the 3 of us REALLY wanted breakfast, and came to find it unavailable.  I was really disappointed.  I love breakfast.  I almost cried, legitimately.I digress.  There were plenty of tasty looking things on the menu, and I liked that all of their breads are made in-house.  Everyone enjoyed what they had.  My sister had the turkey croissant, and my boyfriend had the turkey club with a cup of chili.I had the Courier burger, which came with thick sliced bacon and cheddar cheese.  I could tell right away this burger was going to be delicious.  It was cooked on a flat-top griddle, which imparts such good flavor.  The patty was perfectly seasoned, and the cheese and bacon were just right. I didn't add ANY condiments or garnishes to the burger, just ate it as is.  The bun was a perfect brioche-y, eggy delight.Lunch for three came to $33.00.  I will certainly return the next time I am in Champaign, and try to get there early enough for breakfast.",

I ignored my intuition that this place is probably only suited for breakfasts.  There were limited items on the menu that were healthy.  I ordered the soup and sandwich combo.  I had black bean soup, which was pretty tasteless, and the chicken salad sandwich, which was unremarkable and doused in too much mayo.The worst part is my dining companion got the special, a chicken fajita bowl.  Now, let's grant that you probably shouldn't expect excellent Tex Mex in a joint with antiques and an Americana vibe.  But, he took the plunge.  He sincerely regrets this, as he was rendered useless after eating the bland \"fajita bowl\", which was more like chicken salad with jarred salsa in a taco bowl.  By useless, I mean he must have gotten an extreme case of food poisoning because he spent the entire remainder of the day making multiple trips to the men's room.After an experience with the food here that left us sick, I wouldn't come back.  There are much better places to grab a bite in downtown Urbana.",

I know you have friendly and skilled servers that have been happily working there for years who ask if you want separate checks before you even order.  I know your food is delicious and eclectic with your amazing, packed salad bar and uniquely named menu items like the Monkey Stuff sandwich with bananas, peanut butter, shredded coconut and honey; or your Rancheros Rarebit, the over-stuffed breakfast burrito doused in red sauce; or even simply, the Paperboy, Courier or Morning Edition breakfasts of eggs, toast, hash browns and choices of meats and fixin's.   You carry baked goods like powdered-sugar-topped brownies, gigantic cookies and breads such as the \"Bubby Bun\" -- I know this.  I know that you can make me a super sundae loaded with nuts and fruity goodies, or a Green River Phosphate with whipped cream foaming over the side of my frosty mug.  I know that you have a different flavored coffee offered every day of the week in addition to your regular and decaf, and I know that you sell bags of each flavor so that we may enjoy them at home any time we want.I know all of these things....So, why is it that every time I think of you and your wonderful establishment (you won't be leaving us any time soon, I am sure), the one thing that comes to mind again and again......is your hand-dipped, peanut butter shake.  Sometimes I wonder if I should have malt or chocolate added to compliment the peanut butter, but I always go back to just plain peanut butter.  I don't even care if you forget the whipped cream (although, you never do).  Just give me the peanut butter blended smoothly into the vanilla ice cream, in a frosty mug or a foam to-go cup and I am elated.  I will wait and wait how ever long it takes (because I know people line up to partake of your fabulous fare) just to take that first, satisfying sipand slip into a frosty bit of heaven.  And thank you, thank you for always making a little too much so that you have to bring out the metal shaker with the extra shake bits for sharing with my friends.  Because you know it's very difficult to want to share this with anyone.There is one more thing I know.  I will always be back to visit you every time I'm in town.  Because I do.  Thank you, Courier Cafe.Love,Clarissa J.",

I ordered two eggs, sausage, potatoes, small fruit bowl and coffee. The waitress did an excellent job, looking over me just enough without being intrusive. The eggs, over easy, were too easy. The yolk was properly runny, but unfortunately so was the white. Sausages were tasty, but not seasoned enough. The hash browns were good, but could have been crisper. The English muffin that came with the meal was toasted well, but buttered too heavily. The total bill was $11.13, so plus the tip, my breakfast cost over $13.00. Next time I'll check the prices on the menu, I just assumed that they were in line with other breakfast eateries. I would give this place two stars if the service had not been excellent.",

Overall, we had a good experience.Pros:-Service: The cafe was fairly busy, but we were seated right away, and we all had water glasses within a couple minutes. Our waitress was friendly, attentive, and very patient. If I could rate service separately, it would be a 5-star rating.-Decor: I like it! The theme seems to be old-timey newspaper, which is pretty cool. -Milkshake. Mr. Boyfriend and I got a peanut butter to split, and our friends got butterscotch. Awesome.-The \"Skinny Dippers,\" crispy, fried potato skins covered with cheese, bacon, sour cream and chives. These will make a person anything but skinny. We got a half-order to split, and ended up with approximately a bazillion potato skins. Wow.-Food in general: pretty good! -Menu: Quaintly themed, with desserts named after newspaper stuff (\"Headliner,\" \"Misprint,\" \"Cub Reporter,\" etc...). Standard American fare, sandwiches, burgers, etc.Cons, Almost-Cons, Slight Issues:-Price: It wasn't terribly overpriced for being right in downtown Urbana. I'm willing to pay $5.75 for a BLT. I just want the BLT to be a great BLT. The BLT was a good BLT, but it was a $4 BLT. Tiny slice of tomato, lots of lettuce, some decent bacon, on basic slices of wheat bread. The skins were $4.95, and these are SO worth it to split with a group, because of how good they are and how many we received. Milkshake was $3.75, I believe. Altogether, Mr. Boyfriend spent around $30 before tip for the two of us. -Timing: We arrived at 12:10, ordered by 12:15, and were served at 12:45. I had to be back at work by 1, so I had hoped the food would come out more quickly. This isn't a terrible wait, and like I said, the restaurant was doing good business. Still, I had ten minutes to eat, but 30 to talk. I would rather have 30 minutes to savor those potato skins, and ten minutes to talk to the jerks I call friends, but you can't always get what you want.",

I loved the old-time atmosphere and I didn't catch our waitresses name but she was without a doubt the most friendly I've had in a very long time.  We made it a little before the lunch crowd and I'm glad we did because they were packed!  Expect a bit of a wait at peak times, as the seating is limited.I had the Tuna Melt with onion rings and I have to say the food was delicious!  I also highly recommend the sweet potato chips and milk shakes...awesome!  We'll definitely be making it back here in the future, as I loved everything about Courier Cafe!",

I got the turkey club sandwich and I added sprouts (which was an additional 75 cents? I thought that was just a tad too much) and the subtotal for my sandwich was then $8. I can't complain though because I saved the other half of the sandwich for dinner since the portions were pretty big. My brother went to the salad bar and it's only 32 cents per ounce, so his whole plate was less than $5! That was pretty awesome.",

The sweet potato chips and onion rings were a hit at our table too.   They have a pay by the ounce salad bar too which ended up very cheap because they don't weigh your salad dressing or bread.

The Banker's Burger is fantastic, the Monkey Stuff sandwich sounds weird, but is amazing. Some of the sandwiches are obscene in their size. Asking for a side of mayo is a mistake as they will bring you a 1/4 of mayo. The sweet potato chips are delicious. They also have a salad bar that has a decent selection.But ignore all of what I said above because none of it matters. Even if Courier had the worst lunch and breakfast food on earth, I'd still go for the shakes. Oh my god the shakes. I get the shakes thinking about their shakes. Feeling like a high roller? Order the apple pie shake. Some of the waitresses will not know what you are talking about, but once you explain it to them, they will make it. Piece of apple pie + ice cream + blender = apple pie shake. They will charge you for both a slice of pie and a shake, and it is worth every penny. Great to take your date who isn't watching her figure (or is way too damn skinny and needs to bulk up a bit). Seriously, stop reading and go get an apple pie shake!",

OMG, the bread was to die for! Husband ordered basted eggs, bacon, and rye toast. We considered the hash browns -- they smelled wonderful in the kitchen -- but are trying to watch our waistlines, so passed on potatoes this trip. They were working on setting up the lunch salad bar (it was about 10:30 when we got there) and it looked fresh and delicious.

Our waiter was very friendly and the bill was super affordable. I had a blt on toasted wheat with dill potato salad. It was simple and phenomenal. Additionally the courier offers a wide array of milkshakes and ice creams. I ordered a cherry cola phosphate and it was sweet and delicious. I'm giving them 5 stars despite the fact that the boy working the front was a little standoffish it's okay he's probably in highschool I'm sure he will learn manners as he grows. I will surely return to this wonderful establishment.",

My friend and I split their Dagwood, and Desert Dippers (healthy, right?) and were STUFFED afterwords.

A big breakfast is always a good way to kick off a day.I picked up a Denver Omelette with hash browns -- as much as I wanted to try the Spanish Omelette with chorizo, something about tequila in my eggs didn't really sound quite right. It was good. The omelettes here aren't mile-high and fluffy; they're more traditional omelettes, but still made with fresh ingredients.The hash browns were pretty good. Both maybe could have used a little more seasoning, but I was satisfied with both items.Now, the almond french toast -- if you like your french toast sweet, this is the item for you. The batter was spiked with serious amount of almond extract, and once you pour maple syrup over it... watch out! Still, it was very good. What few sips I had of the New York Egg Cream were also quite good. The chocolate flavor was pretty good (perhaps not as dark as I prefer, but... I have no idea what a New York Egg Cream is supposed to taste like) and also very sweet.For a basic breakfast, I wasn't blown away, but I would definitely go back to Courier Cafe for a good breakfast the next time I visit Urbana.",

My burger reminded me of a day at the park where you buy frozen burger patties from Costco and throw em on the grill. Where's In-and-Out when I need them? They also wouldn't cook my french fries extra crispy for some reason which was also another negative. The highlight was probably the hot fudge sundae but as a reminder, unless you like eating dessert as dinner, share that sucker with someone. I'd go here again if I wanted something super casual and laid back. But since I usually travel here with a band wagon of people, I'll have to take them elsewhere.",

I had the turkey croissant, which was good but gave me a vibe of how I could have made it at home.  I do not like how fries are not automatically included with sandwiches (see picture).  However, my boyfriend seemed to really enjoy his Southern Fried Chicken.  The Skinny Dippers were to die for, literally, there's sour cream, bacon and cheese on them!The ambiance is great and classic.  They have an ample number of wooden booths and a beautiful copper ceiling.  The menu looks like it came from a printing press used to advertise the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, for which I believe they have pictures of on the walls.I would recommend Courier Caf as great place to top off a dinner date meal, take your family, or catch up with friends.  During nice weather they have outdoor seating.",

My friend got the Buenos Dias burrito and a glass of milk.We both thought our meals were delicious. I particularly liked the fresh croissant that was the bread of my sandwich. The hash browns had a good balance of dryness and wetness, which I feel can be easy to goof up and make them too dry or wet sometimes. These were done right.Our server was pleasant but really busy. My only issue was with the coffee, I feel like it took way to long to come out. I'm a bit of a coffee fiend and especially when I have a hangover I want that stuff ASAP!Prices were fair and the food was great. Courier is an all-around safe bet for breakfast and lunch in Urbana.",

My husband chose this place because he had been here many times during his college days.  He said it hasn't changed a bit.  We had excellent service, and outstanding food.  I always appreciate restaurants that offer vegan or vegetarian choices.  I was able to get \"The Courier Breakfast\" (2 eggs, bacon, ham, or sausage, served with hash browns and your choice of toast) with vegetarian sausage patties.  My eggs over easy and German Rye toast blended well with the patties, and the hash browns were perfectly browned.  Add a small grapefruit juice, and bottomless coffee and my meal was just what I wanted.  I wanted the Almond French Toast too, but had to pick only one meal.  I'm not in the area often, but I would definitely come back.  I loved their selection of kids's book (see photo) if you have a child that needs occupied at the table.  There is also plenty of parking, both in the lots next to it, and across the street.",

The menu looks like it has appetizing, if plain, selections, but the food doesn't taste like anything and there's so much of it on the plate that after a while you begin to feel as though you are in a fight to the death with it.  I've heard people say that it's diner food, but it tastes more like reheated frozen dinners. It looks like food, and sometimes it smells like food, but inexplicably, it doesn't taste like food. The service is serviceable. The bathrooms are appalling.  The salad bar is puzzling.  The four times I've been there, I've found it rather difficult to get cashed out.  After which, I've been surprised at how much cash I've just spent.",

Eggs were cooked perfectly, toast was brown and buttery, potatoes were addicting, and bacon was crisp.  Problem with that?  No.  It's nothing immensely creative or surprising, but I got exactly what I wanted and I enjoyed the atmosphere at the same time.  I'd always come back here for brunch.",

Have been on a super-awesome-diet for a bit, now, though, so instead of my usual (the bacon cheeseburger (and even _I_ can't believe I found the strength not to order that one!!)), I decided upon a healthier option-- the trout with a visit to the salad bar.Disappointment, upon disappointment for this poor meal.  The trout was cooked in what was supposed to be a lemon-like sauce.  Now, normally, if I've had trout, it's either cooked crispy in the skin, or filleted out of the skin, and cooked in the sauce.  Not for this unfortunate creature.What I got was a piece of trout cooked in the skin, but steeped in the sauce, so much so that the skin had become rubbery and chewy.  The \"lemon\" flavor was so absent, that all I was left with was an incredibly FISHY piece of fish (which is never really a plus for me), in a gelatinous, plasticy skin.  I did my best with it, but it was a disappointment.  I have to expect that Courier has cooked harder dishes (with Silvercreek in the family!!), so... I don't think it was out of the realm to imagine they'd do a good piece of fish! The rest of the table was pretty happy, though.  My trip to the salad bar was less disappointing, but wilted lettuce, and the inability to get to the items I wanted on the bar (most of the healthy options are waaaaaaay toooooo farrrrr in the back, and grossly out of reach from the average grabber) made the salad blucky, too!

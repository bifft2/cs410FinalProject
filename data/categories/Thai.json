I hate the muddy flavor of talapia, and felt cheated because the dish cost $15.95.Our waiter didn't return for about 18 minutes, so I went ahead and started eating the sauce with rice, just barely nibbling on the fish.When he returned, I told him that the fish was talapia and not snapper. He checked with the chef and came back and verified my suspicions. I told him he should give us a discount since talapia is an inexpensive fish. He didn't understand and sent the manager over.The manager insisted it was red snapper and tried to convince us of that by talking about the chilis and spices. Excuse me, I know that red curry sauce does not make red snapper taste like talapia. I cook Thai food at home. I know what different fish taste like.She refused to give us a refund, and was not polite at all about the situation. If our waiter had shown up sooner, I would have just sent the dish back and ordered something else. (Of course, they probably would have tried to charge us for both!)In addition to this, the dish was overly salty, over priced, and they used that granulated garlic that leaves a bitter taste in your mouth for two hours. We won't be going back!",

I have probably eaten at around 25 Thai Restaurants in my life, so take the review for what it is worth.That said, this place was great.  I like my food really, really spicy.  Often I order it \"Thai Spicy\" and get something that barely makes me sweat.  Not the case at Nitaya, the fried rice and pad thai were packed with flavor, and spiced to perfection... about as hot as I can tolerate (which is how I ordered it).  Keep in mind I fix tacos with bhut jolokias and habanero peppers.  I like spicy food.The setting was fun, service was great, mango sticky rice was fantastic.  Make sure if you're not a fan of cucumber water that you ask for tap.  Overall, this is one of the best I have had in IL, ranging from Chicago to Carbondale. So far, it is my top in Champaign.  I can imagine that better exists (that mythical 5 stars), but I haven't found it yet.",

At school, the kids pick their teams, and no one ever picks you as their favorite.Honestly, given the competitiveness of Thai restaurants in town and the steep rental prices for property in downtown Champaign, how does Nitaya make it?  The food is not offensively bad, just forgettable.  I've sampled their curries and noodle dishes but nothing invokes the vividly bright, colorful senses that I associate with Thai cooking.  My entrees there are often limp and sad (but maybe I can blame that on the lighting...?).If you want to go on a serious date for Thai food, Nitaya Thai could serve as an appropriate setting.  The interior decor is immediately recognizable as an oh-so-camp, tropical-themed '80s bar, with wicker chairs and faded turquoise booths.  There's something undeniably charming about the setup, but unfortunately it lacks the warmth that only a crowded dining room can offer.",

I had the padthai, which was excellent. The waitstaff is friendly and professional. The only weird thing is how empty the place always is. (And the painting of Abe Lincoln is kind of odd too, but we are in Land of Lincoln here.) I wish more people would go so they don't have to close down or something.There is free parking on the weekends in the big parking structure behind the restaurant.",

We got chicken curry (meh, watery), pad thai (unmemorable), and crab Rangoon (not bad except ummm no crab or crab flavor), and dynamite rolls (weird, mediocre).  Then, my boyfriend got FOOD POISONING for the first time in years. We eat out all the time, we eat at Thai places frequently, he didn't not order anything unusual for him. I called the owner to inform her and ask for a refund. The conversation with the owner was unbelievable, laughable at best. She kept repeating she sold so many curries last night and no one else complained. She demanded to know what else we ate. and if he was allergic to anything he ordered. I proceeded to explain we did not eat anywhere else and the timing was about right for salmonella. She was defensive, argumentative, and inappropriate. At one point she HUNG UP ON ME! She states because she didn't hear me speak. Because I was stunned for 3 seconds at something incredulous that she had said, don't remember what bc there was so much. When she told me salmonella only takes 2 hours, I informed her no it doesn't, and I'm a physician I know it takes about 8 hours onset. She then proceeded to mock me and say that what kind of doctor are you? You should be nice to the people and high degree you should be professional. She kept interrupting and at one point, OUT OF THE BLUE, she asked me if I was married and had kids! I told her that was irrelevant and inappropriate and she said something to the extent of, \"you're mean and that's why you're divorced\". !!!!?? I've never been married or divorced and I'm not sure how that comment is allowed from a business owner to a customer. ?!Anyway, reporting her to the health department. Can I report her to the police too for verbal assault? Haha.",

The hair was long and black sticking out of the mound of rice on the plate.  When the replacement rice came back from the kitchen, it was the same rice, just forked through to remove the hair.  Next up was going to the bathroom.  As you walk to the back of the restaurant, the floor, walls, etc get dirtier and dirtier - and then look to the left and you'll see the same dirt and chaos in the kitchen.

The manager and I discovered that my meal should have actually cost $14.24(+3 tip) and the waitress added an extra $4 more dollars!! Then when I asked to be refunded the double charge and the over charge of the meal THE MANAGER REFUSED!! She told me I should have handled it that night.  I had to dispute it from the credit card company. The sad part? The food wasn't even good :(  After talking to a few people from the area about the situation, they all said this is the worst Thai in town.UPDATE: After 2 months the credit card issue was resolved. After Capital One contacted them and made them issued a refund, they dragged their feet a month later and did it. Capital One asked for them to show signatures/receipts for the charges and they couldn't provide receipts. What's worse? I tried to explain that to the owner at the beginning when it happened that the credit card company will make them issue the refund if they can't show proof, and she didn't care.DONT EAT HERE unless you want a two month ordeal for fraud charges.",

I ordered Pad Thai with tofu for takeout and when when I got home, there was absolutely no sauce or flavor to the noodles at all.  I guess when you order it not spicy, they just don't add anything to it? On top of that, the texture of the tofu was a little off and it felt overcooked.  The noodles also had a weird rubbery texture I've never experienced before. It was edible, but not good.  Perhaps I just didn't order it properly? So a friend was visiting and we both had a taste for thai food. Nitaya was on our way to downtown so I decided we could give this place another try.  This time, I ordered the Pad Thai with tofu again, but I told them to make it Mild.  It was better than the first time I had it, but still kinda bland. The noodles were again really rubbery and just not appetizing. The portions are also kinda small for the price. I've eaten at MANY thai restaurants and this is unfortunately one of the worst. Sorry, Nitaya Thai, I'll be trying the other thai options in town next time.",

I was obviously disgusted and I told the waiter. I said I couldn't eat it and he turned and left. He didn't take the food away, apologize, or offer to bring me something else or a new plate of pad thai. He ran away because he didn't want to deal with it. So, then he finally comes back and tosses the bill on the table and leaves. I tried to get his attention but he was ignoring us! When he finally comes back I tell him that we're not paying for my meal since I couldn't eat it because of the hair. He said he'd ask his manager and when he finally came back he said they could take HALF off my dinner.  WHAT? Really? I took maybe 4 bites total before I found the hair and obviously didn't eat anything. Finally, he took the bill to his manager who took the pad thai off the bill. Also, the few bites of pad thai that I did have were awful. Not flavorful at all. The sauce was almost creamy. It was very different from any pad thai I've ever gotten and it was gross. I understand, sometimes things may end up in the food. I'll be reasonable about that. However when it does, make it right when it's brought to your attention. They didn't do that or even try. I will never be back.",

The portions were plenty for two ladies to eat their fill; their was actually about a half serving left over.The decor is dated classic for a Thai restaurant.  They have a full bar, which is really nice.  A strong IPA pairs well with most everything on the menu.Their green curry is delectable.  Flavor spot-on.  I ordered the spiciness level at American hot.  It was amazing- just on the verge of being too spicy for me.  Love when the heat is a challenge and my face turns red and the tears threaten to well up.  Perfection!The tom kah was fairly good.  They use regular ol' domestic button mushrooms, which is one complaint I have about both Nitaya and Siam Square.  Tom kah should be made with straw mushies.  Straw!Nitaya does go the extra mile of slicing the shrooms thin and sauteeing them before addition to the soup.  This makes a world of difference and is much more close to the flavor I'm seeking in this particular soup.I'd probably give this joint four stars if not for the outrageously inflated prices and the fact that although they are listed as a delivery restaurant they never have had a driver when I try to order from work.",

You enter the place and he would say why don't you take the dinner menu and grab some place behind you, instead of taking us to seat and giving us the menu. You order appetizer and he would not bring the sauce and would instead stand there and play games on his phone. He would not ask if we need anything to drink, nor would he ever ask if everything tasted good.I mean to say its a fine dining restaurant and not a fast food one. If you are prepared to be treated like that, visit it.",

I had the yellow curry with shrimp which tasted good, but I would have liked to have a larger portion.  The thai iced tea was delicious!  My friends' dishes looked delicious as well.  Service was pretty slow...the restaurant wasn't full but there were several tables seated.  They didn't seem to have many servers working.  I felt like it was a little expensive for what I got.  Overall, I'd probably return if I wanted Thai food and didn't want to leave downtown Champaign.",

I speculate that the high prices are to cover the overhead on the large (in sq. ft.) restaurant area, or maybe they use really high-quality ingredients in some dishes and spread the cost of those over their cheaper dishes. I say this b/c I have only gotten pretty simple stuff like pad thai, tom ka, and curries from them (no fancy fish or meat) and have always felt that I overpaid by at least 50%. IMHO, Nothing about this place justifies the excessive prices (though the dope mural outside comes close). The quality of the food is about on par with or slightly higher than Thara Thai, but the prices are nearly double.",

The server there, a funny, thoughtful guy in his 20's (whose name I've forgotten--dang!)I showed up here yet again with Nicolle and Carol and even though Nicolle had a problem with her dish, he was kind, friendly and very cool about returning the dish for another.  He also managed to keep thte table constantly full of water or any other food items, which was fantastic.  The best part, however?He made a reference to \"Pedagogy of teh Oppressed.\"  Any waiter at a Thai restaurant who can cite the brilliance that is author Paolo Friere, deserves to have his restaurant kicked up a notch.  Fantastic.Now, can we make the food a bit more exciting next time?",

First of all two people in our party were brought plain soda water instead of sprite and when the waitress took the glasses away to fix her mistake she never brought back one of the glasses. Then the waitress accidentally dumped salad dressing on my friend's coat and new purse. The manager brought her a wet towel and apologized but then at checkout denied the accident ever happened and refused to compensate my friend for her meal or the dry cleaning that was now necessary. I was unfortunate enough to get food poisoning from this establishment, and I know it was from them because I found a piece of raw chicken in my pad thai. It was so raw that I noticed it because it was rubbery! I turned down the offer for a new dish because I was so turned off by the raw chicken that I didn't want to eat anything else and they refused to comp the bad dish at checkout.",

I was hungry but there's a universal understanding that Thai food portions should ALWAYS be big enough to make at least two meals out of.  That is a fact and Nitaya, to quote The Dude \"YOU FUCKED IT UP!  YOU FUCKED IT UP!\"Lone positive:  As much as I bitch and moan, the Pad See Ewe was kind of really good and at the perfect level of spiciness.",

Sorry, not a fan. After the disappointing crab rangoon, I was served my chicken pad kee mao. I ordered it spicy. I love anything spicy and I have a very high tolerance for spicy foods, but this was almost too much. I could feel my face turn different shades of red, my nose started being runny and at times it felt as if my airway was closing. Ok. Maybe that's a tad overdramatic but seriously, this stuff was HAWT. I couldn't even enjoy any pad kee mao flavors beneath that level of hotness. Whew. I eventually got used to how hot it was but the food tasted just ok to me. It wasn't really bad but it just wasn't great either. I did however enjoy the ambience and the comfy booths.",

Correction: Golden Wok has the best pad thai EVER.  And yes, this is comparing it against not only the local places, but also every thai restaurant I've ever been to, and I've been to plenty.  The reason why their pad thai is so good is because of the flavoring: A lot of other Thai places either don't have enough of it, or they have so much that it's overly sweet and/or salty and it becomes so cloying I can't ever bear to finish it.  Golden Wok's pad thai, on the other hand, is done so well I finished it very quickly in one sitting...and as others have said, their portions are VERY generous.  Besides the flavor, the noodles are also done well, not mushy and stuck together, and not undercooked, and overall the dish isn't too oily either.  Four stars for the delicious pad thai all on its own; I haven't tried anything else there but we'll see how that goes...like I said, I usually stay away from \"chinese/thai\" places, but I feel like Golden Wok has earned my respect, if nothing else for their pad thai.They have their own lot, so parking isn't as bad as it is on campus.  Look out for the small yellowish standalone building; it's easy to drive past it.",

It doesn't get a huge amount of foot traffic through it and is located on the border of one of the sketchier areas in Champaign, but the food is good for what you pay for. A typical entree might be $8-9 (which is expensive for Champaign IMO). But you also do get lots of food. My favorite dish here is Beef Pad See Ewe which is the long noodles with broccoli, bok choy, and beef. Put a little siracha sauce on it and you have a really tasty dish.The restaurant is family owned and they seem to be there all the time. They are really good about phone orders and being fairly quick about bringing dishes out, though sometimes they might forget something. You just have to have thick skin when going into the place, because you might not get the best service.The downside of this place is that it just seems a little bit dirty. The tables are a bit grimey even after they wipe them down. And you have to clean up everything yourself. But the family is super nice and the food is good and there really is no Thai place like it in the Champaign-Urbana area.Other popular dishes I see people get are:Pad ThaiRed CurryGreen CurryI give it 3.5 stars, but not enough to round up to 4 on the food alone.",

I remember eating here my freshman year when my cousin brought me here.  I had a craving for some pad thai, so I decided to come here again.  Ordered an order of shrimp pad thai.  I usually order beef pad thai wherever I go, but I decided I would try something different.  Very large portion, easily enough for two meals.  Great flavors as well.  My only gripe is that they left the tails on the shrimp, so I was faced with the option of picking them off, which is a pain or just eating the tails on.  I went with the latter, which wasn't a big issue, but still undesirable.  Next time I'll be ordering beef pad thai.",

I was even more suspicious of their advertisement of combined Thai and Chinese cooking.  However, as I passed by one day, I noticed that the outside window declared that they served Hainan chicken rice, a traditional delicacy rarely mentioned outside of larger urban areas.  I gave it a try, and now I swear by Golden Wok for my Thai cravings.Champaign diners go nuts for the pad thai here.  I'm also a fan of this popular noodle dish, but for my review, I'd like to pay homage to another favorite dish from this modest little store: the tom kha kai.The tom kha kai soup comes in generous portions, with lots of chicken, soft mushrooms, bright chili flakes, slices of scallion, and a few pieces of ginger and lemongrass (shouldn't eat those last two, but at least they're testaments to the broth's beautiful flavor).  Soups at Golden Wok are spooned over jasmine rice instead of noodles.  This dish easily served as 3 meals for me, and is irresistible given its price ($7.35).",

I probably will not go here again.  Also, the workers have a hard time speaking English. It was hard to understand them, and I was note sure my order was being communicated correctly to them.

So far I've had their Pad Thai, Pad Kee Mow, Pad Prig Pow (not sure on this name), and Ho Fun and they were better than anything you can find in Champaign-Urbana. That's not saying a whole lot, but their Ho Fun is one of my favorite things to get when I eat out. Their curries are also pretty phenomenal, the meat quality isn't too great, you can tell that they buy their meat (except maybe for the duck) from the big commercial vendors but the curry itself is exceptional. If you do decide to go with the curry I'd recommend the Panang as it's not loaded with vegetables as the other variations tend to be.The Thai iced tea is also quite good. Thai iced tea is one of those things that's almost guaranteed to be good anywhere you get it, but as Christina F. puts it, it's well worth the $2.10 if you want a nice sweet closer on your meal. Their lunch specials however are a little less desirable, as it's pretty much the same as every other Chinese lunch special in town with the staple Beef with Broccoli, Shrimp in Lobster Sauce, Sweet and Sour Chicken and the like, and it's honestly not very good. I've personally tried two or three chicken dishes for the lunch special decidedly giving the Wok another chance for redemption after each subsequently disappointing meal, but they failed to deliver, each dish being pretty much the same as the last but in a different sauce.I also have to agree with the 2-star review that's also up here. The Tom Yum Khai wasn't very good when I had it. I ordered the Shrimp Tom Yum Khai and it tasted overpoweringly like shrimp and mushrooms, you could barely taste the broth under the taste of these two ingredients.Overall though, I'm willing to give Wok 4 stars because if you know what to order, you're almost guaranteed to get a good and tasty meal.",

It was a scene worthy of a movie - dramatic music, slow-mo closeups of pad thai flying everywhere, and fat tears of epiphany rolling down my cheeks to salt up my food. Not that the food needed any more salt or additional seasoning anyway. In direct contrast to the squat (one could even go so far as to call it ugly) exterior, the dishes are pure decadence in your mouth. Yes, the pad thai is awesome but people, let's stroll down some paths less taken, shall we? Pad see ew is also good, though in my opinion, perhaps a bit too much sauce. My favorites would have to be the Golden Fried Rice (offered only on their Shining White Board of Specials) and the Beef Noodle Soup. The Golden Fried Rice is curried, pineappled, raisined, egged goodness. Sounds weird but the lesson here is \"never judge a book by its cover\", remember? The Beef Noodle Soup is perhaps a direct cousin of Vietnamese pho. I've never been quite sure whether to go ahead and give it the pho label because it just never seems quite..... pho-y enough. But irregardless of labels, its exactly what I find myself ordering when it's blizzarding and I just want some hot broth and flavorful noodles to fill me up. The curries are also excellent. Hell, just go ahead and order everything. I'm pretty sure you can't lose.Could it get any better? Why yes, it can, rhetorical question asker. With giant portion sizes! Unless you're of the same breed as some of my male bottomless-pit friends, be prepared for leftovers. Advice: noobs should go with an experienced G-Woker. It's a hidden gem - emphasis on hidden.",

Though I do like the pad thai more than the duck fried rice, I feel that this deserves some special mentioning.  It is delicious and is one of the best fried rice dishes that I've ever had.  They pretty much took the chopped up roast duck that you'd typically find at Chinese stores and made fried rice with it.  All the duck grease melds with the rice and it is awesome.  Oh yeah, being chopped up means that there's bone in there too... to be careful about that.Regardless, this is yet another must visit if you're in this area.",

Brought my dad here one time, and he really enjoyed the pad thai. I have also ordered and enjoyed the green curry here. Pretty authentic, given they use several authentic ingredients, including the green gourd-like vegetables in the stock. Great food, great price, not so great location.",

The filling that we could taste in the rangoon was, at best, ok. It might have been better, but the outside was so gross that we didn't taste the filling too much. My wife spit it out in her napkin (she never does this). Not again.",

I went with the Singapore special, spicy curry chicken with onions. To treat myself I ordered an eggroll and also hot and sour soup.When the delivery came 40 minutes later, I was surprised that the eggroll did NOT have the typical packets of sweet sauce or mustard sauce, the chopsticks that I asked for in my special request were NOT delivered, and the spicy curry chicken with onions was approximately 12 ounces of brown sauce with some chicken parts in it that appeared to have been smashed with a sledgehammer.There was no rice provided and there are no other vegetables in the dish other than approximately six rings of a sliced onion swimming in brown oil.The chicken was skin and fat included. Bones were included as well, although they had carefully smashed each bone so that it was in multiple shards with sharp edges.This may be the quintessential way that Singapore special spicy curry chicken with onions is served.So shame on me if I just was not familiar with the dish. A little rice on the side would have been a nice treat.The hot & sour soup was neither better nor worse than any other hot and sour soup I've had from any other Asian restaurant in Champaign.",

Some of my favorites:-I know everyone says this, but it's true that the pad thai is up there with the best I've had!-Basil eggplant-Broccoli in garlic sauce-Vegetable egg rolls-Yellow curry with veggies and tofu (they usually load it up pretty well)-Papaya salad is a nice fresh raw change from your usual saucy Asian dishes-Pad see ew-Hot and sour soup-You can add tofu to anything for a dollar or something, so I usually do that",

This place is really easy to miss because it is a tiny building that does not look anything like a Thai restaurant.The restaurant was completely empty when we got there but while we were eating there was a steady stream of people coming in to order take out. We ordered the Tom Yun Koong, Yum Nuau, and Jungle Curry.Tom Yun Koong is a soup that is exactly the same as the traditional Tom Yum soup found at all Thai restaurants and it came with shrimp.  The soup was delicious, but definitely not the best I have ever had. It had the prefect amount of heat, the shrimp were not overcooked, and the vegetables were nice and crispy.Yum Nuau is a spicy beef salad. I always order this dish when i go to a Thai restaurant and I have to admit that this salad had some sort of different spice which was very tasty. Again, it was not the best I have ever had but it was deliciously unique. All the vegetables in the salad were super fresh and the quality of the beef was excellent. Jungle Curry was very confusing though. It came in a big bowl with a ton of fresh vegetables and wonderfully seasoned chicken but the sauce was some sort of chicken broth with seasonings. I thought that they brought me the wrong dish but sure enough it was the Jungle \"curry\" that I had ordered. This was the first time I was served a curry dish which did not consist of coconut milk. It was very tasty though and I was not disappointed that I ordered it. In the future I will definitely always ask for the ingredients in the dish before I order it.  One other complaint was that the menus are very simple and do not have pictures or any sort of description of the dishes. This would be nice but not a big huge deal.The service was excellent and the people working there are very friendly.I would definitely recommend this place.",

The online ordering was not working so I called and was pleasantly surprised to speak with someone who was able to take my order in coherent English, as this has always been an age-old problem ordering Chinese food over the phone.Delivery time was ~45 minutes, which seems to be the standard in Champaign-Urbana, no complaints there.We ordered Chicken Yi Mein and Sweet & Sour Chicken with a side of egg roll and egg drop soup. My Yi Mein was just fair, the thin noodles were interesting but overall I thought it was bland. It looked like the sauce had pooled up at the bottom and it was almost all liquid. The quantity of chicken to vegetables to noodles was also kind of unbalanced, I thought. My friend's sweet and sour chicken was much more flavorful and tasty than my dish, I probably should have ordered that. He also liked the egg-drop soup.However, the reason for only 2 stars comes from the egg roll. My friend found a very small chunk of what he believed to be plastic inside the egg roll. We tried really hard to identify the object but gave up out of disgust. I don't think there's anything that justifies this, and coupled with my underwhelming Yi Mein, I probably would not order from here again.",

I ordered their Massaman Curry and it was just plain awful. The rice was cooked too long and was on it way to becoming congee. The curry itself was tasteless, way too salty, and over spiced to the point of being bitter. The pork was over cooked. I took about two bites and tossed the entire thing.

It's quick, it's cheap, it's delicious, and it's guaranteed to cure your hangover.  And the restaurant space is white, bright, and pretty!  Sitting by the window is perfect for people-watching.",

The food is not the best, but it's always edible (by college student standards, at least).The main issue I have with their food is the overwhelming greasy-ness. I've never had a pad thai so oily and \"fried\" tasting. It's good, but it's heavy. And it's not what I'd consider \"pad thai\", rather some sort of Basil Thai original creation. The other noodle dishes are all the same way. The main dishes with rice are better, but still nothing memorable. Salads are absolutely not recommended, with greasy meat thrown on top of chopped iceberg lettuce. I have heard good things about the soup, but never tried it myself. What I have enjoyed is their curries. I can't remember which specific one I got, but it is the only thing I remember ordering there that I felt fit in with all the other Thai food I've eaten in my life.The Urbana location is a nice place to sit and eat-in as well, as opposed to the one on Green Street which is far less classy.",

When he told them he was never, ever coming back there because of his bad experience, they just shrugged. Since I'm currently home sick and most places are closing and I need spicy soup in order to live through the night I am seriously considering plastering their windows with fliers that say 'FUCKING RUDE ASSHOLES WITH BAD SOUP' after my recovery from the flu.Obviously, this is totally fucking unacceptable and extremely bad business. I order a ridiculous amount of thai food and will never be back to this place - this is my karmic retribution for trying to stray from Siam Terrace.",

I'd eat there on weekends with friends before we headed out to hang out and have fun. The first dish I ordered there, Pad See Ewe, I instantly became a fan of. It remains unchanged on their menu, which keeps me going.For the price of their entrees (~$7), you're bound to leave the place happy and content. The thai iced tea, while a bit on the expensive side, is also a treat with any meal. Unfortunately it's price and the lack of free refills (~$2) makes me feel a bit unsatisfied.It's certainly not the best thai food I've had, but it's definitely not the worst either.

The setup of the restaurant is obviously catered towards students; much like other campus restaurants, there is no wait staff and customers are expected to clean up their own dishes when finished.I've sampled a broad range of dishes at Basil Thai, and my favorites are the tom yum noodle soup and egg noodle/BBQ pork soup (particularly comforting in winter).  While the pad thai and pad see ewe are good enough to sate a noodle craving, they are somewhat mediocre.  I also dislike the tofu used in their curry dishes as it is plain cubed tofu (soft-ish and flavorless), whereas many places often choose a hearty, smokey bean curd instead.I attend student lunch meetings that are frequently catered by Basil Thai.  The employees are very familiar with our group and the protocols associated with the university (including tax-exemption policies), and they now throw in free appetizers (usually fried spring rolls) when we order. Many of the complaints from other reviewers seem to be primarily associated with food poisoning and (strangely) the basil chicken.  I've eaten at Basil Thai well over 50 times in the past 3 years, and I've never personally encountered food poisoning (fingers crossed?).  As for the basil chicken, I am sure that there are all sorts of regional variations of this dish, but I am mostly familiar with the ground chicken version that seems so revolting to my fellow reviewers.  Google a recipe for the dish and you'll see that Basil Thai isn't using ground chicken just to be offensive.",

The guy working there refuses to give a refund, only offering more of the same food that had made my friend feel like throwing up after his nice discovery. Good business!OK, Basil Thai - you get one more try. I go there and my other friend orders Basil Chicken which is made with \"ground chicken.\" Upon receiving the order, we notice the chicken is \"ground\" into pieces of the size of bacon bits, not to mention there was barely any of these \"chicken bits.\" So, we ask for more chicken, since it's a chicken dish, and the same douchebag refuses, saying we should pay for more chicken and that it's \"our fault\" for not reading the description. He refuses to give a refund because \"we already paid for it.\" What the fuck? How exactly would you get a refund if you haven't paid for something in the first place? Genius!

Though it may appear slightly princely compare to other restaurants on UIUC campus, it is well worth the extra dollar or two, especially if you like spicy Asian cuisine.I almost always get their Thai ice tea, which still taste sweet upon dilution with a cup if water. My personal favorite is their Tom Yum noodle soups since I am a sucker for noodle soups. Their deserts are also delicate in comparison to other places nearby and will not disappoint!

My wife enjoyed her Pad Thai, but it tasted really oily to me, with too much cabbage. There's no kids' menu, so we had to improvise. We got them chicken fried rice to share.

I opened the rectangular styrofoam container to find it packed completely full of noodles (this was right after they opened, since then they have raised the prices a tiny bit and the portions are a little smaller). They were greasy, and saucy, and there were a lot of vegetables (good ones too! broccoli, carrots, bell pepper). It was exactly what I needed. The chicken wasn't the best quality.. I haven't ordered it again. I've switched to the vegetables and tofu, which is much better. This is my go-to place when I'm feeling super hungry or a little under the weather.

Its a particular favorite for groups because you pay up front and don't need to worry about splitting the bill. The quality of food really depends on what  you order. Chicken, except for the satay, is typically not high quality. Beef is the better choice if you like meat. Vegetarian dishes are quite good here though and they do use a lot of vegetables I like such as zucchini and bell pepper. I like the curries and they are pretty spicy, but lack a certain complexity in flavor present at other Thai places. The only truly atrocious curry, which you should avoid, is the panang, which is almost like vegetables in a thick sauce rather than a curry.Besides the curries, I love the Thai veggie egg roll appetizer- noodles and vegetables rolled in a rice pancake. Beats Chinese egg rolls any day. Unfortunately the spring rolls are not so good. They are assembled bizarrely so you can't really eat them without seeming just a little rude as they fall apart in your hands and you are forced to gobble each piece in one giant bite. The peanut spring rolls are the worst offender, as they are both improperly assembled and drenched in a sweet sticky sauce. Not the best Thai food, but a good choice for groups and vegetarians.Just to warn you, but their tray system is idiotic. You clear your own tray and the rack you put them on doesn't fit the trays well. Glass breakage and embarrassment ensue.",

Instead, when I received my order I got vegetables with ground up chicken bits that were about the size of the beef you would find in ground beef. I was immensely disappointed so I went up to the front counter to ask for a refund as this is not the dish I expected it to be. Instead, in Engrish, the manager said to me, \"you already pay. No refund.\" Uhm, excuse me?!?! If I paid for something and was unsatisfied, shouldn't I receive a fair refund? Not for this place apparently. Avoid at all costs and go somewhere else!",

There is no table service: diners order and pay up front, choose a seat, then the meal is brought to the table when it is readyThe dishes, of which I've had a broad sampling, are prepared to order using fresh, cuisine-appropriate ingredients. My only complaint is that they seemed to have lightened up on the seasonings in my favorite dishes since they moved to Urbana. However, they provide fish sauce, soy sauce, and hot chile sauce for those who want to dress it up a bit.In spite of the plain decor I've given this restaurant four stars because it succeeds in being what it is-- a fast, fresh, tasty presentation of Thai food.I'd like to address a comment from other reviewers regarding the use of ground chicken in their Basil Chicken (one of my favorite dishes). Like it or not, ground chicken *is* appropriate in that dish; I make it at home using authentic recipes and that is what is called for. Furthermore, cuisines the world 'round feature ground meat, often but not exclusively in the form of sausage. To rant about ground meat, though mildly humorous, shows a distinct lack of familiarity with food in general and this Thai dish in particular. But I suppose that is one of the hazards of user-submitted reviews.",

                "review": "I discovered Basil Thai on a visit to UIUC in high school.  At the time, I was just getting into Thai food, so I had very little experience with it.  I got the pad thai and thought, \"Wow this is really good!\"  Well, over the years, I've eaten a lot more Thai food and my opinion of Basil Thai has gone down.  But don't get me wrong, I'm not a Thai food elitist (I save that for sushi) and I still do enjoy eating here.I used to only get the pad thai here, but now my go-to dish is one of the salads, yum moo I believe it's called.  Lots of lettuce, topped with thinly sliced pork, with a delicious and somewhat spicy dressing.  I definitely recommend it.  I've sampled other dishes as well, and they're all pretty tasty.  Not the best Thai I've had, but I still keep going back.  It helps that it's cheap!In general, I've always had a good experience here.  The food is made relatively quickly and it's always come as I've ordered.  I've come a few times with large groups (12-14 people) and it's actually pretty nice to not have to deal with waiter service.  There's no wait for a table (assuming you can push some together, but you usually can) and no issues with getting separate checks or dealing with tips.  If you're looking for top of the line Thai food, you should probably keep looking.  But if you're looking for a quick Thai fix, definitely give Basil Thai a try.",

The space is a bit sparse, yet it's pleasantly decorated. Decent is the watchword for Basil Thai.  The place feels like a gussied up cafeteria with nice little touches.  The curry was...okay.  It was my fault for trying to be super manly and ordering it as extra spicy, and they delivered, but of course that obscured the full range of the curry's flavor for me.  And I went through four glasses of water.  But that's how things go.So if you've learned anything from this review, please remember: Basil Thai is decent, and masculinity is not safely garnered by eating super spicy stuff.",

You can definitely get a larger portion for a lower price elsewhere. Also, be sure to specify the spice level!!!! I forgot to mention that I would have liked my pad thai to be spicy, and the person taking my order never asked, so I guess they made it as mild as possible...which was pretty bland. I had to add some sauce of my own to add flavor.I was hoping to have a better experience at my second visit, but I guess I should have known better. It's very possible that their other items are better, but I have not had any luck with their most popular dish, the pad thai.",

Depressing atmosphere that smells strongly of the Subway next door. It's not particularly appetizing, unless you're really into subway (and in that case, just go to the subway). Be prepared to wait for a long time for your food during peak hours--despite being a walk up and order kind of place, it's definitely not fast food. Curry is the worst with very little flavor. Pad Thai is so oily. Two high points: Cashew chicken and vegetable noodle soup. The veggie noodle soup is bland (kind of my expectation for noodle soup...) but it's reliable, filling, and cheap! And the cashew chicken has pineapple. Yum.",

I usually go for the Pad Thai or Pad See Ewe with chicken, but their other noodle dishes as well with their curries and rice dishes are also tasty.  There is also a good selection for if you are vegetarian (you can replace any of the meat with tofu or mixed vegetables).  Can't say I'm a big fan of their noodle soups though - I find them kind of bland. Price-wise, at $6/$7 a dish, it costs approximately the same as if you were to grab lunch on Green St., but this is definitely the place to go to sit back, relax, catch up with friends, study, etc. while grabbing a bite to eat if you have some extra time.While they do tend to err on the greasy side, I have never been dissatisfied with an order, and their friendly service coupled with the clean, open decor (much nicer than their sister location on Green St.) is very refreshing compared to many of the grungy feeling restaurants/cafes around campus and keeps me coming back.",

Thai iced tea is always a great to-go option as well. I think Basil Thai offers quick turnaround times for your orders, convenience, and affordable prices for the college kids.

Run-down watery curry with meat that taste like dog-food. The taste was bland. Lack the uses of spice and herb. What a disaster.I am from Thailand and I am very embarrassed for them to call this Thai curry.",

Total came to just over $12.    After about five minutes, my soup was ready for me!   It came with the traditional garnishes of bean sprouts, lime and jalapeno (but the mint/thai basil was missing...but i don't use that anyway). At first taste, the broth was solid.   The noodles were clumped up into a ball and despite other reviews, their wasn't a lot of meat in it.  A few meatball halves and the flank steak.  After a few squirts of hoisin and sriracha, i decided that this was just an ok Pho.  Nothing spectacular.... The broth didn't seem like it simmered overnight....there was something a little \"instant\" to it.    The egg rollls were crispy but really lacking any seasoning. I don't think I would order them again.   The pho was just ok... I'd rank it probably second best in the land.   I would prefer to walk down the street and eat At Pho 911 anyday.  The place was busy and it seemed everyone was either ordering the pho or a thai curry.   Welcome to town, Pho Cafe!",

It was about $9. The portion sizes were a tragedy. Most of the dish was rice. You can ask for more rice if you wish, which is nice. Essentially, you're ordering rice with a side of curry. The curry smelled lovely. It was very fragrant and it tasted good, but it was thin and unremarkable. The beef was also very thin. I also tried the pad ped with tofu and it was extremely disappointing. Again, the dish had rice as it's star and some marinated veggies on the side that I assume was the pad ped. The flavors were not very strong and I couldn't taste the curry at all. It's hard to believe that this cost $9.",

                "review": "Restaurant reviewThis restaurant just recently opened up at the end of December when the students were away and it was featured this week in the local newspaper. I was excited about trying a new \"authentic\" thai restaurant. My prior experience at the other pho restaurant was rather disappointing on green street. When you enter you line up to order at the counter, afterwards you are given a number and wait for them to call you for your meal. I wanted to try the roasted duck with rice or the hainan chicken, but I went with a safe order with the chicken pad thai because they recommended it as one of the signature dishes. It didn't take long for the dish to come out, about 5-7 minutes after I placed my order. The chicken pad thai was a bit lacking in texture and flavors. For a good thai dish, you get the nice crunch of peanuts along with the sweetness and soft texture of noodles. There was a few specks of peanuts and nothing more. The flavors also was very one note, not very sweet like at other places, but also not very exciting. Portion size for the price paid was good. My wife had the tom yom seafood dish. No exotic seafood just some shrimp and mushrooms with lemon grass etc. It seemed to lack the sourness which is often a highlight of the dish. It really is a 2-3 star restaurant. I was hoping for better, maybe it will improve the next time.Pros: inexpensive thai food, friendly service, good portion sizeCons: flavors and texture are off, maybe they are new but it just doesn't have that specialness which would make you crave this place for thai foodHidden deals:None",

It is not fancy - it is your basic noodle shop, but with a wonderfully nice family running it, a clean, bright environment, and a decent menu. We had the fresh shrimp spring rolls, chicken pad thai (requested spicy), and duck yellow noodle soup.  All were good, but the pad thai was one of the best we've ever had.  At the owner's suggestion, a squirt of lime juice brought it to life (it was already good, though), and the serving was enough for two meals.  The spring rolls were very good, and a good fresh start to the meal.  The duck yellow noodle soup had very generous portions of duck in it, and while it started off a bit bland, the addition of a bit of Hoisin and jalepenos (that's what those accoutrements are for!) it was lovely. I demolished it (and I usually can't finish a bowl of pho). For two, with one meal easily making two meals, we spent $24.  Very reasonable in my opinion. The only minor quibble I have is that there is no basil or mint with the pho or in the spring rolls. I would imagine that's either chef's choice or a cost thing.  I loved everything we got and this will be a regular stop, however, so it must not be that big of a deal to me.",

The words 'PHO' emblazoned on their window caught my eye and I could have sworn there was a pizza place here last time I remembered seeing it. But my hankering for pho overcame my craving for bagels and without any record to be found via Yelp or Foursquare I went in.The interior is simple and a little spartan, but it's fine for a little university eatery. Some decorations wouldn't hurt though.I knew what I wanted coming in. A bowl of beef pho. The decision was a simple one, the only have one option for the different types of meat pho and one size. I wasn't disappointed by the lack of options though. The portion was generous and came out piping hot.The broth was solid, with a nice round taste and slightly sweet ping. I added some sriracha due to my love for some kick. No hoisin needed for me! The noodles were good. Hard to get those wrong. Now we get to the meat. Generous amount of meat slices, brisket, and meatball halves. The slices themselves were a little well done, but the taste was still good.All in all, I'd have a hard to choosing between Bangkok Thai and here for a good bowl of pho. Guess I'll have to take turns!",

One of my labmates recommended the shrimp and turkey pad thai, and that's pretty much all I get there.  And I can't say I've ever been disappointed.The shrimp are usually nicely cooked and you get a fair amount for the low price.  The noodles are oily and delicious and it's always enough to fill me up.  Some days it is a little more spicy than others.  The egg rolls are also cheap and not bad, but the shrimp and turkey pad thai is where it's at.  There's only one or two other thai places I know of within walking distance from campus (at least, for my lunch break) and they are much more expensive, and I don't think the food is any better.Basically, the Y eatery gives you tasty, cheap, fast pad thai with few frills.  Absolutely perfect for when you are having a lousy day and need a food pick me-up, or after teaching a bunch of discussions.. and it really is one of the cheapest places anywhere near campus.",

                "review": "\"Yay! I'm a fan.\" In the interest of a sincere and reliable review, let me preface this by saying that this is NOT phenomenal Thai food. You'll have to get off campus (and out of this town, probably) for that. It is cafeteria-style with basic dishes like pad thai, curry, and basil chicken. I think it's good for what the style and resources of this place imply. The food itself is not a compelling reason to come here.What is a compelling reason is how close it is to the quad. I have a schedule that can keep me near Armory and Wright until 8 or 9pm, so it's difficult to find a place I can dash in and out of and that serves decent food. Many lunches have been spent inhaling my sad, but delicious, meal bars. Queue Y Eatery. Y Eatery is a godsend (heh...). It's right next to my classes, it's fast, the portions are enough to keep you eating for lunch AND dinner, and the owners are just clearly top-notch people.So many times I have never noticed this place because it's inside the YMCA. It's kind of a weird place to be located, but oh-so-convenient. The owners said that they had a large sign once but it was stolen soon after it was put up. They wanted to know how I had found them since they're so hidden, and they were really glad to see that word had gotten out.Something that really affected my experience here, and I want to be clear about this being a factor in my review, was how wonderful the owners are. They are welcoming, funny, and they take care of you. I have never had a dining experience like this. Ever. A point of clarification: One of the old reviews said that it's cash only, but it's currently not.",

It's really nothing fancy: you get to pick between three or four dishes (pad thai, curry and a couple others), you pay your 5 bucks and that's it. But: the food is tasty and filling, and the service is friendly. So it seems to draw the crowds, and there was a line the time I went. I'll be back for sure.",

I came to the conclusion that, even though I haven't been there in eight years, the Y Eatery is definitely my go-to example of Pad Thai amazingness. Somehow they strike the perfect balance of everything - it's not greasy, but the noodles aren't dry either. It's spicy enough to be flavorful, but not overwhelming, and the tofu is good quality. It's super cheap, too! Seriously, if had a private jet and a staff to do my bidding, there's a fair chance that I'd send them on a Y-Thai run now and then. If you are in Champaign, go to the Y Eatery! I'm very jealous.",

I'm floored at the graciousness of the gentleman running the place and the food is even better than last semester. Happily, there is a new Chinese portion of their menu. The food is fresh and good. I've enjoyed the crab Rangoon, the chicken fried rice, the General Tso's Chicken, the pad Thai. Note that the pad Thai is a whole lot spicier than it was in December 2013. Even still, I think it is better. It's worth your time to stop.",

This isn't like that. This was the first place to serve Thai food in Champaign-Urbana. The minute they opened, the quality of life there went up about 300%. This is a great little lunch spot. I don't know how many hundreds of times I've met a friend at \"Y Thai\" for lunch. It is a sentimental favorite. Even after moving away and not coming in for months on end, I can still count on being greeted with \"Hi! How's your mom? Where've you been?\" The Pad Thai is really good. And cheap! Sometimes I order other things, and they are sometimes good, but I always wonder what I was thinking and go back to the Pad Thai.",

My boyfriend ordered the cashew chicken for the first time and he loved it. My friend got chicken fried rice and that was good as well. The price is fairly cheap for the portions at this place which is great for college students. I would come back here for food but not for the pho. I'm only giving three stars because of two reasons. One of them is that I ordered the Thai iced tea for almost $3 and I expecting to have some refreshing authentic Thai iced tea, but instead it was a really small bottled one from the fridge which was pretty disappointing and not worth $3. The woman behind the cashier said \"I'm too lazy to make a real one,\" as her excuse. My second reason is that the restaurant was way too humid and hot with the doors open on a humid rainy day. I was sweating uncomfortably while eating my hot pho and it was unpleasant. There were workers fixing the ceiling tiles or something nearby too, which I thought was unacceptable for when people are eating around them only a few feet away. The food was good, the atmosphere not so much. I will still be coming back for a quick Thai fix because it's so accessible and conveniently located on Green st.",

Giant chunks of noodle with some veggies. We both thought it was great. The only downsides were the spring rolls had too much lettuce and they didn't have authentic thai iced teas (only ones that came in pre packaged bottles - which still tasted fine but not what we were looking for) All in all, great food. Good find but those disappointments were worth taking a star off for. Highly recommend!",

In addition, you can also adjust the level of spiciness to your liking, on a scale of 1-6 if memory serves me right. Their pho is also fantastic! Very authentic and very large portion. One no longer had to travel to downtown Urbana to Xin Xin Cafe for pho. The staff are all extremely friendly and am not afraid to chat with you despite their slight language barrier. They are always cheerful and if there's something wrong with the order, they immediately replace it without further questions asked. Definitely a place worthy of regular visits!",

This is located in the little plaza on Green and Fifth.   You place your order at the window and in about 5 minutes, they call out your order and you go pick it up.  So there's no waiter service.   I ordered the Pho with rare flank steak and it was the most authentic I've had in the area.  Yes, it beats out Xinh Xinh by a LONG SHOT.   I also ordered an egg roll --- it wasn't great but it hits the spot if you need an egg roll fix.  It's more like a Chinese egg roll than those fried Vietnamese spring rolls which I was hoping that this was.... but alas.   The soup on the other hand, was delicious.  The noodles were the right texture, the beef was tender (although I wish they put more in) and the accompanying bean sprouts, jalapeno, lime made everything taste better!!  I love this place and will definitely be back now that I know that there is close-to authentic pho in Champaign now.They do have an extensive Thai menu as well, but I would stick with the Pho.  I saw lots of other customers who had various Thai noodle dishes who seemed happy.  The only drawback to this place is that it is in Campustown.",

There isn't anything too special in terms of toppings for the fried rice, just onions and the main ingredient that your order (tofu, chicken, beef, and shrimp fried rice). Also note that shrimp fried rice is not on discount during Tuesday. What makes their food especially delectable is their spicy levels which range from 1-6. With such a wide range, it's somewhat hard to discern the levels of spicy. I've had level 5 and level 6 meals here and I can't really tell the difference sometimes. The service is fast and they have a plethora of water pitchers for water connoisseurs like myself.",

This restaurant reminds me of the Hong Kong dai pai dong food stalls where you order and they call your number to pick up your food. My wife had the pad thai which was a good value and tasted like pad thai. I ahd the pho and it was 2 thumbs down. Even though it was the combo pho with everything, there was not a lot of protein items and the noodles were overcooked. The worst thing was the pho broth which is usually a highlight. I don't know what they used to season it but somehow it tasted like dish water. There was no clear broth flavor with star of anise or hint of cinnamon. It just tasted very off and I could not stomach more than a spoon of the soup. If you want cheap food then the lunch special looks like a good deal, but stay away from the pho at all cost!Pro: inexpensive, no tip you bus your own tray, lots of seatingCons: terrible pho soup, not good at allHidden gem:I have not been here for lunch, but for 5 dollars that seems like a steal with good portion sizes per other reviews.",

It's also much more savory and filling-- I can eat twice as much Pad Thai than Pad Kee Mao and still be more satisfied with the latter.The food can be inconsistent. There are days when I find the Pad Thai too dry or even too saucy. I understand that the cooks make a lot of Pad Thai (especially on Mondays), but I find the Pad Thai inconsistent even on weekends.I recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a quick lunch or looking for a place to sit down and hang out with their friends.

Definitely could step up their game a little bit...and it wouldn't hurt them to try and keep the location a little cleaner and nicer looking.  The self- busing is fine as well but couldn't they maybe put in a bit more money to class up the place?",

Not even worth it!!! Also ordered the Pad See Ew and that was too salty and not enough noodles or meat. Tried to order a home made or made from scratch Thai iced tea and was referred to a can version of it! No thanks! And why would a Thai restaurant have pho on their menu??!!! Stick to your own cuisine and perfect that! Needless to say, pho isn't all that either. Everything there is over priced for mediocre food. Students beware! They think you don't care or know any better since you're college students! On the bright side, the fried rice was decent.",

I still remember the first time I had it, I was stuffed to bursting but still had a bowl of that delicious broth left and I honestly felt guilty about throwing it out. The rest of Thai food is serviceable but I only come for the pho. Word of warning: in the cold winter months this place is FREEZING because of a combination of the heavy foot traffic leaving the doors constantly open and the location in the mini mall. The doors face right into the wind which is funneled right down that corridor like a wind tunnel.  The inside is also always cramped and packed though turnover is quick so tables tend to open up regularly. I would do takeout a lot more if it wasn't such a hassle for pho (multiple containers to separate the noodles/broth/garnish and you need a big Chinese soup bowl to put it in once you get where you're going). The folks behind the counter are great friendly but busy so don't expect a lot of chitchat at lunch rush. They do speak Thai and you will get major brownie points if you can summon up a friendly sawat dee or kup kum krap/kah.",

For vegetarians, you can basically make any dish vegetarian by adding tofu instead of meat, and the Oriental Vegetables/Tofu dish is fantastic. While I've had meh experiences with their pad kee mao the last two times I've eaten here, I'm assuming it's more of an aberration than a trend.",

Though I had already been forwarded about their spicy level and stated my preferred starter number which was 3 to vary how spicy I could go and one day when I feel nice a stupid I'll go up to 6 but I am not a young man anymore and I WILL regret that act of bravado.

Another thing I love about this place is that they have weekdays special; from monday to friday, you can order the special for about $6 and the quantity is still the regular amount.

In general, it's not the best Southeast Asian food I've had (I grew up in New York City), but it holds its own.

Now this is mainly a review for their pho, since that is the staple item I get whenever I pop in. If you're looking for a spot in CU to get a bowl of piping hot pho, this is definitely one of the places to do it (if not THE place). The noodles are wonderfully cooked, the meat is just right (because they do the proper thing which is place the thin slices raw on top of the noodles right before adding the steaming hot beef broth right on top, so it immediately cooks in the heat, but doesn't overcook), and the portion is great. Also the broth, it has dimension, it isn't a flat tasting beef broth, but rather, you can tell it's been simmered with its probably gigantic bag of spices for hours on end. For a large bowl of pho, it'll cost you under $10. Even if you get the one with all the fixings (flank, brisket, round, tripe, tendon, etc). The restaurant itself is very much a campus kind of casual restaurant. You order from a window, pick up from the same window, bring your food to a table, and service yourself with napkins, sauce, silverware/chopsticks, etc. Hey, if it keeps the price down, I'm not complaining at all. You even can grab yourself/your table a nice full pitcher of ice water and cups! No need to wait for any waiting staff to refill your water. I have had the opportunity to order and try their other dishes. Their pad thai is pretty tasty and flavorful, but their pad kee mao leaves a little to be desired. I haven't tried their curries before, so I'll leave that to those more experienced. Overall, Bangkok Thai is a bit of a campus establishment (alongside Empire Chinese food right next to it) and I hope it'll continue to be one for years to come!",

They had glass noodles in them, a little carrot, and some cabbage. Nothing special. The Bad:-Unless you get a lunch special, it's pretty expensive for what it it is. We ordered the Pad Se-Ew, which comes with meat (we had chicken), wide noodles, egg, and broccoli. While it had an okay amount of broccoli, it definitely could have used more. Plus, the entree is $8.95, which is, again, high for what you get. That being said, the entree was more than enough for my fianc and I, so really only about $4.50/person. Overall, I'd return again, but on a weekday so I can take advantage of the specials.",

Overall I think the food's better than average. Maybe my standards for Thai food are too high b/c I lived in Evanston (the \"dining capital of the North Shore\") where there were at least 4 great Thai restaurants nearby. The service is prompt and friendly, though the ambiance does feel a bit warehousish. I've heard from many friends here that Siam Terrace is the best Thai place in Champaign Urbana...I'll vouch for that (w/o trying the other Thai places) and emphasize the qualifier \"best...in Champaign Urbana.\"",

I could tell that she didn't appreciate the texture...she had that \"I'm gonna puke, but not because it tastes bad\" look. I think we all know what I'm talking about. Overall, a good night out. I'd return, but I'm guessing that I'll try something different next time since I don't visit the Alma mater that frequently.",

It's a shame they don't advertise it better, because it's a really great deal and very convenient.It's for carry out only, and $8.50 gets you an egg roll, salad, and your choice of Thai fried rice, Spicy fried rice, Pad See You, or Red Curry. You can get the entrees with either chicken or vegetable. That said, I got a Pad Thai with tofu and vegetables today and it only cost me an extra $2. They don't seem to be terribly picky about substitutions. The portions were smaller than if you eat in, but I was still stuffed. It comes in a really nice little partitioned tray that's sturdy enough to be reused (free tupperware - score!). They will also deliver if you order 2 or more of the boxed lunches.",

The restaurant was also freezing inside... turn up your heater! The two times before that, the food was just bland, overcooked, and not appetizing at all.  This used to be my favorite thai restaurant, but something changed, and I don't even care to go here anymore.  Something changed, and it wasn't for the better!",

The duck noodle soup was excellent - very flavourful, non-soggy noodles, good broth, large chunks of duck. Both were deliciously spicy as we had requested.The value: It seemed a bit pricy for comparable food. Maybe because this place is off campus? There was no lunch menu. Maybe because today is a Saturday? The pad see ew noodle dish was $10, the duck soup was $15. Including tax & tip, we rang up a little over $30 for 2 people.The atmosphere: Siam Terrace was a warm respite from the windy & cold walk to get there. It's located conveniently in downtown & was peaceful for a Saturday. The wait staff was attentive & kept our glasses filled. The decor isn't outstanding, nor is it hideous.",

Both restaurants have their particular strengths so part of it depends on what you're in the mood for. The staff is very friendly although sometimes a little slow if it gets busy. I think they have the best pad thai in town. To me it has the perfect blend of sweetness, nutiness and spice complimented by the fresh bite of the cilantro and crunch of sprouts and shredded carrot. It's sweeter than your typical pad thai but it's very well balanced overall.Their appetizers are nicely priced and I have enjoyed all of them that I tried. I would not recommend the Thom Kha soup here. It's a bit too sweet and lacks some of the depth of other versions of this soup I've had. It's not bad by any means, but it wasn't what I was looking for in that soup. Be bold with spice here. It can vary, but I find that they tend to be a bit more gentle with the spice overall.A big plus for Siam Terrace is its selection of sushi. It's decently priced for the most part and everything I've had is tasty. I'd definitely recommend their Bakery sushi. It's moderately priced and is battered and served with some excellent eel sauce. Be careful when you first get it though as it's VERY hot.For a drink, I recommend trying the coconut juice or Thai Iced Tea. Both are refreshing and a great, sweet compliment to the spicier dishes.",

The duck dish still had a lot of gristle and bones in the duck pieces, and the soup wasn't that flavorful.  It felt kind of expensive for the amount and quality of food we got; we meant it as a treat meal, but it didn't really feel like one.It had, however, been a few years and it was a convenient spot for lunch.  Knowing that they had lunch specials, we decided to give it another try.  As you can guess from the number of stars, we won't be trying it again.The atmosphere/decor is fine - not especially distinctive, not going to really scare anyone off or impress them.The service was likewise fine, fairly attentive for the lunch rush.The food was disappointing.  The salads were iceberg lettuce served with a very firm tomato slice and sliced carrot.  The dressing didn't taste much like ginger - it was mostly sweet and very watery, so that there was a puddle left on the plate after finishing the salad itself.  I think I would rather not have had a salad, as opposed to having such a perfunctory one.For the main dish, I got the red curry and my wife got the pad thai.  The pad thai was really, really sweet.  The red curry was alright - despite being labeled as two peppers on the menu, it didn't have much heat.  I got it with chicken and there wasn't a huge amount of chicken in it.I really hate to say it, but I felt like some of the distinctive thai flavors - the spice and basil, for instance - were toned down or absent, creating a more Midwesternized version of the dishes.Portion sizes were alright - we both ended up taking some home to eat later. Basically, the food was okay.  However, the price for the two lunch specials + 2 iced teas + one thai tea (also incredibly sweet, but it's supposed to be) was about $22 with tax.  For that price, I found myself wishing we'd gone somewhere else and I can't say that anything else on the menu made me want to return.",

They also serve smaller portions at lunch. For dessert, try their seasonal Sticky rice with mango - while I've never been a fan of mangoes in the US, this restaurant knows how to pick their mangoes! For drink, try the Thai iced coffee/tea.Service is always wonderful. They also have wines and liquors, but c'mon who drinks wine with Thai food? :)Just don't try their sushi.",

The second order showed up almost immediately and the last one took close to 20 minutes. For the most part there were two girls taking orders, busing tables and answering the phone--at one point another server did show up to help with the full restaurant. Our bill was incorrect and it took talking, more like arguing with the owner to get it rectified, then the owner yelled at one of the servers in front of the patrons--bad customer service.",

I love their vegetarian options (even though I eat meat) - they make a mean mock duck and they are willing to substitute Seitan into just about any dish. I discovered the CRISPY pad thai about a year ago, and it's become my favorite dish (pad thai that's fried? what's not to love??).The very best part about this restaurant is the fact that they deliver to Urbana residents EAST of Vine st. My only complaint about this place is the variable service (esp since they don't take reservations). I've been here for both dinner and lunch on several occasions and I have to say depending on which server you get, the service is either great or horrendous. beware...",

Person on the phone had no clue what they were doing. He immediately took my personal information before I could even ask if they delivered. Then he indicated he thought they did.   Their yelp ad mentioned a free app if you indicated you found them on yelp. I mentioned the add and it took. Several minutes of listening to their background conversation before they.   Determined they would only give me that if I came to the restaurant.  After all the hassle the supervisor came on and confirmed they didn't honor the ad regardless of the fact the ad didn't specify. So I said I would just cancel what would have been at least a $50 order. She said ok and just hung up. Wow. I guess they don't need the business.",

Between the four of us, we ordered, the Lava Trio, Pad Thai, Thai beef noodle soup (Thai pho) with a crab rangoon on the side, and a vegetarian tofu stir fry. We also ordered three rolls of sushi Atmosphere (2/5)Not fancy, very casual, chill. Like most Champaign Asian restaurants, a little dingy. There is a small outdoor seating section, and some nice natural light near the front with the windows.Food (3/10)Let me start with the good. The crab rangoon was good. I mistakenly ordered it after reading the reviews for the My Thai crab rangoon, but I was pleasantly surprised because I enjoyed it. The Lava Trio was also decent. Not the freshest seafood (alright not fresh at all), but it was tasty albeit expensive. That is all that was good about this place. The Pad Thai and vegetable stir were both  too salty and too sweet. The beef noodle soup was basically salted basil water, with a heaping serving of oil. On top of that, our server decided not to bring out thesushi until well after we were finished eating the rest of the food despite asking for the sushi first. When the sushi finally came out, one of the rolls, called the White Bear, came with very little scallop in the roll, and on top of that, my dad who orders the roll regularly, commented on how it was the worst White Bear he has ever had. The Volcano was some kind of crab cake on top of a basic California roll. The Bangkok roll, which I ordered after reading various reviews, was a heap load of good ingredients thrown together into one mess of a roll. That one I picked apart and ate the pieces individually. Not bad.Service (2/5)Our server seemed nice enough, but unfamiliar with the menu. When I asked for opinions about her favorite dishes, she barely had any opinions because she barely had touched the food. At least she was honest. However, When we complained about the White Bear being subpar, she gave us a dirty questioning look, apologized, and offered free desert as compensation, which unfortunately, we did not try because we were full. Value (2/5)The food was not that good. Ok it was pretty bad. And also not cheap. Our billcame to over 100 for four people. Three of us did not enjoy our meal. Overall the whole experience breaks down like so: Atmosphere: 2/5 (Dingy with some decent natural lighting near the windows.)Service: 2/5 (Server gave us dirty looks when we complained about the White Bear.)Value: 1/5 (Small portions + bad food = sad wallet.)Food: 3/10 (Parts of the meal were edible but not much was enjoyable.)Overall: 8/25 - Would have to pull teeth to make me go back. Try at your own risk. Maybe you will have better luck.",

It's also memorably one of the few restaurants I have a favorite dish at just because they make a red curry so well. Don't let that detract you from choosing something else on the menu though. The rad nar, pad thai, and other options are all excellent choices. I'm just particular I guess.It's not quite five stars just because sometimes it does feel a little cramped if you have four or more people (and the proximity of the tables feels a tad off), but I'd have to say it's more than four. Appetizers are alright, it's hard to go wrong with basic fare although the shrimp appetizer is quite good and I heartily recommend it.While I put it at $$ it's more like $ and a half. Prices are very reasonable, with my favorite red curry starting at $8.99 or so for the vegetarian, chicken, or tofu options, and a bit higher for meat entrees (usually no more than $12 in the case of seafood).",

Compared to Thara Thai this restaurant is a much less inclined towards the spicy and many dishes seem to have sweet ingredients like tamarind.

I ordered Chicken satay for appetizers and Panang curry, firecracker chicken, and pad thai noodles for main course. Chicken satay and Pad thai noodles are decently good, there are places that serve better than here. However, the firecracker chicken and panag curry were a delight. Both of these were made perfect, with a little bit spice and touch of peanut in the taste. I have not had better firecracker chicken and panang curry in Urbana Champaign till now. I would definitely go back for these two.The portions are good enough for two people and the food is delivered in a decemt time. The staff is courteous and well mannered. Ambience is also good, especially with a nice view of historic Urbana.",

The menu is very extensive, and carry most typical Thai dishes. I ordered a cup of Tom Kha Gai, which was delicious and which I highly recommend (btw the cup is more a bowl than a cup, and is plenty for one person). For my entree, I got the spicy fried catfish, which was also quite good: fried catfish filet stir-fried in a spicy sauce and topped with crispy basil leaves. The portion was very large and it was tasty, but I wish it had come with some vegetables.The service was prompt and efficient and pretty friendly (but what is up with bringing the check before I'm done eating?). I'll probably be back.  3-1/2 stars.",

Warmly painted walls; artwork that doesn't hurt your eyeballs.Service good, friendly and fast.  They actually seemed to care how we liked the food.Sushi here was solid; there were some inventive rolls.  Everything sushi prepared at an open style counter towards the back.To me one mark of good a Thai joint is the tom kah.  It's fairly amazing in the flavor department here.  Loved it- but for the mushrooms; not straw like would've expected, just regular plain old button mushrooms.  It was the only off flavor in the soup.Red curry was nice.  A three on the spicy level was perfect, but next time I'd ask for three and a half.  The salad dressing on our tiny side salads was so good both myself and dining companion drank the last left in our bowls.Oh, and the best part: forty bucks got both of us enough food for 2-3 meals.",

However, the last time I visited they told us that they weren't serving sushi at the time. Not sure why or if they have a specific time for it but that was somewhat disappointing. So call ahead if you want sushi! Still, I like Siam. I feel like it's one of the few good Thai places around Chambana. Definitely worth a try.",

Our table shared the mussels, a spider roll, chicken satay, and lava chicken. The mussels were MASSIVE! I was expecting them to come in a bowl cooked in sauce as I'm used to, but these are served on a plate with a dish of cold sauce to dip them in. The sauce is a vinaigrette that was supposed to have some heat, but I didn't notice any. The spider roll was exactly what I'm used to. Very small wasabi/ginger portions! The chicken satay was a-ok. I've had amazing, this doesn't compare. The peanut sauce really helped, though. The lava chicken had no heat at all. It looked tasty but was actually very bland.

(And I will edit this review as fits.)I'm new in town and hadn't heard of this place, but my date had been here once before and enjoyed it.  We went on a Monday evening.  It's a small restaurant and I've heard people complain about how it is decorated and kept, but I really liked it.  It was clean and neat and small inside, though it is in a strip of bars and other neon-lighted windows.  If you think you're in the wrong place, you might not be.  Once you get inside, however, it's decorated like your classic Thai restaurant.  We got the summer rolls as an appetizer and that was the beginning of the *yum* experience.  Very fresh veggies in a light wrapping, dipped in a spiced peanut sauce.  I didn't think it could get any tastier until I got my dish, a house curry with tofu.  I forget the exact name of it now--I'll edit this later for it.  The first one on the curry menu, though; it's really worth trying.  I got a 3.5/4 spicy rating (yes, I did ask for the .5, thank you very much ;-)).  I like how they have this scale, to be honest.  Anyways, delicious!  Perfectly spiced, not just in a hot way, but in a everything-is-done-right-down-to-the-last-grain-of-spice perfect.  I don't even know how to describe it aside from that.  The tofu was cooked perfectly, as well.We washed it down with oolong tea, from bags, but this wasn't sad enough to keep this place from five stars.  If you know my ratings, you know that means that this place was INCREDIBLE.The service was also excellent; we had two young ladies as our waitresses because one was training and the other, teaching.  Unlike many trainees, our waitress was very professional even though it was apparent that she was new.  The waitresses were very attentive and the service overall was very fast, but did not give up any quality for the speed.Anyways, this place is a must try!Oh yeah, if you try and Google map this, you get real Siam, over in Thailand.  Just a warning.  Thanks, Google.",

We ordered several appetizers (egg rolls, summer rolls) to share. The server brought the appetizer without bringing any plates; so we had to use our hands to avoid dripping the sauces on our clothes! Then it came the end that we hadn't quite finished our food that they started removing the plates.  It was only 15 minutes after their closing time and we were still eating, that the server asked us to leave because their closing time has passed! We said that it is rude to ask the customer to leave when they haven't finished their food yet, but they said it's past their closing time and they have to close! We complied but asked for a refund of the gratuity that they had automatically charged, and they refunded it.",

I usually order a curry, which always comes out deliciously fantastic, and I have a love affair with the eggplant tempura.  Buuuut the last time I dined there I switched it up with a Mock Duck with Basil.  This dish sounded totally delicious, and just to emphasize with the waitress what I wanted, I made sure the dish was 100% vegan before proceeding.  That being said, I was hugely disappointed when, instead of mock duck with basil, I got duck with basil.  This is after having the waitress double-check that the order was vegan, and me saying \"MOCK duck\" several times as she took my order.  So there I was, a lowly vegan in a usually veg-friendly place, with a huge slab of dead meat in front of me.  This upset me far more than I could convey; when they finally brought out the \"real\" mock (somewhat ironic, I know) duck, it was great.  It may seem like an innocent screw-up back in the kitchen, but as someone who has devoted the rest of their life to help end the suffering of animals, I was no happy camper.  For this reason, I can't give it more than 3 stars.Go here, you'll have a good meal, but be warned... the service is frequently slow, and your order might get really messed up...",

I thoroughly enjoyed the sweet and sour sauce that came with them too.I'd say probably some of the best crab rangoons I've had yet in the CU area.My only reservation would be the price, it seems Siam Terrace is still overall kind of pricey.Will update next time we order from there!",

My favs are the heaven duck, devil fish, papaya salad & panang curry.  They also have the only edible pad thai around.  It's the correct color, consistency, flavor and they don't cut the noodles into a million pieces like Basil Thai - imagine!",

But staff are usually friendly. For a place to get a chill dinner downtown, I'm a fan regardless of its shortcomings.",

Subs and sandwiches taste just as well, bar is fully stocked with local and national brews and a brilliantly educated staff can make any drink fast and easy, not to mention the games. 6+ professional pool tables and pinball arcade style games as well! All I can tell ya is whenever I'm in town I will stop to catch a ball game or eat some awesome food and drinks!!! 5 stars!",

The original location in downtown Champaign is a lot of fun, complete with a well-stocked bar, a few pool tables, and a CD juke box which all adds to the low-key atmosphere. My hubby and I went there on our first date and have been back many times since then.  It's not a dive bar, it's not super ritzy, it's always clean and to me, being there feels kind of like you've just gone over to your best friend's house to hang out for awhile.  It's never too loud, never too crazy, they have great service and they do a fantastic thin crust pizza.  My personal faves lie in a dead heat between their \"margherita\" and \"fajita\" pizza.  Though this isn't the only place to offer these selections, they blow away the competition.  Jup's isn't even in the same class with anyone else, it just is what it is (awesome) and I love that about the place.  They just get it perfect every time.",

To each their own I suppose, but quite frankly, it's probably my least favorite pizza around.  Pizza is way overpriced. A small personal 9\" pizza costs about $8, and I equate the taste to that of your microwaveable pizza bites. If you like pizza bites, well heck, then dig in. Their pizza to me is just like saltine crackers with mediocre sauce and stale cheese. Not only that, but food takes forever to come out.I get drug to this place with co-workers every now and then, and our small 9\" pizzas take 45 minutes to come out... That's ridiculous considering a pizza like this should cook in about 6 minutes.... On a plus note though, the servers are great and the atmosphere is nice, but ultimately I go out to eat for good food, and Jupiter's does not deliver.",

There is not a lot of sitting area if you come at peak hours.  So be warned.  Great billiard tables that go the length of this great old building, and people are serious about their pool here.  There is even a patio out back.  The building itself is ancient, and tons of character.The servers work hard, and are very friendly.  Though can get swamped during peak hours.  Just a couple of decent beers on tap.  Usually an offering from Bells, or Summit, and just recently I noticed Lagunitas.  The pizzas are great.  Crispy, thin crust that is awesome.  The specialty pizzas like Pizza Pesto is great.  Can't go wrong making your own as well.  They come in personal, 14\", and 16.\"  Always a good stop downtown for pizza, beer, and fun.",

There's a BIG arcade room with pool tables and video games, but this area gets PACKED if you go at a popular time of day.  I've only been to Jupiter's once, and I haven't really had the desire to go back.  The service was ok, but the atmosphere and food weren't anything special.

My friend and I ordered 2 personal pizzas, the Pesto and the Buffalo chicken. The toppings were fine (buffalo chicken was pretty tasty), BUT the crust was terrible. Someone from Brooklyn a few reviews down has it spot on--tasted like a cracker. This not thin crust pizza. Any random pizzeria in NYC would have had infinitely better thin crust than what these pizzas had. This was cardboard crust pizza. I know this ain't exactly NYC, but for a 4-star joint, I had higher hopes. I would have given it 2 stars, but I added an extra one because it was open late night.",

Check that bill, people.It's pretty loud, people are playing pool and I saw a man so drunk in the men's room, he was stumbling and slamming into the walls face-first.

Especially since they don't have any specialty ingredients (though they do have a variety). Anyway there is nothing wrong flavor wise with the pizzas and I really appreciate how bone thin their crusts are (it's so hard to find crunchy crusts in Chambana). The atmosphere is also very nice. Relaxed. Mostly old people, townies. It's clean as well. But the pizza is much too small for the price. Maybe someone with a normal sized appetite can chime in.Update: I think I found out why I thought it was overpriced. I saw that the pizza was $7 on the menu (I just confirmed it). But was charged over $9. Why? I understand $7 is pre-tax but then, to be conservative, $9 flat would still go over the total. It's not a big difference but it's not acceptable to steal from customers, on purpose or accidentally. Here's the link to their menu with the prices: http://www.jupiterspizza.com/downtown/menu.htmlI got a custom 4-topping personal which should have been about $8 tops. Something that really bugs me about restaurants, as it should, is when they don't care what price they put on the menu and the servers will throw some extra on there because they're careless. Just not cool. Bombay Grill did this but their food is actually good enough that, fine, I'm okay with being stolen from-- take it as a tip. But Jupiter's food is not good enough to justify capricious pricing.",

Drinks weren't expensive, and overall there was a good selection.  A $4.50 Lindeman's Framboise is about $1.50 cheaper than the equivalent size at the Blind Pig, if that gives you an idea of the pricing.  I can't wait to go again, fantastic pizza and reasonable drinks.",

I went to the other one back in my college days, but this one I didn't even know existed. Walked in and it's seat yourself tables to the left, a bunch of pool tables to the front, and a long bar in the middle. Very limited seating, but it wasn't packed at all so that wasn't a problem. There was a weird draft hitting our table though, so we moved to one deeper in the corner since we thought it was the door, but the draft was there too. We just had to wear our coats throughout dinner.For 6 people, we ordered 2 large pizzas, one buffalo chicken, and one prosciutto. I didn't care much for the prosciutto, but the buffalo was pretty bomb. Ordered some small ranches (50 cents per though, what a rip) and it was delicious. It's deceptive that they cut their pizzas into smaller squares because you feel like you can eat so much more. We had 6 slices left over and it was about 42-ish dollars with tax and tip. So a large probably feeds 4 people comfortably, 3 uncomfortably.Weird thing though is when we asked for a box, the waitress asked if we wanted anything else. We said no and assumed she would bring us the check. But didn't and we sat there for like 10 more minutes. Had to grab her attention and then ask for the check. We weren't drinking or anything so I'm not sure why she thought we would want to just hang out. Minor inconvenience though so it's whatever.",

A place where you can swap your favorite pizza toppings with friends, enjoy your go-to beer on the side, chat with friends, and watch the basketball game on their large TVs. They also have pool tables and arcade games. My favorite night to go is Tuesday because they have half off large pizzas and it's a popular night to go. Warning to Chicago-native-deep-dish lovers: these pizzas are thin-crust pizzas and I'm from St. Louis, so we love thin crust pizzas, but this place does not rip you off on toppings. Jupiter's specialty pizzas are great!  There's no need to stress about perfecting your pizzas toppings since they already have specialty pizzas with your already-favorite toppings. If you want to make your own crazy masterpiece, you can customize your pizza with four toppings maximum (meat toppings count as two). More importantly, the price is very reasonable. Also this place has a clean, friendly, fun atmosphere. It's definitely one of my favorite places to go in downtown champaign. I recommend every U of I student to check this place out with friends there before graduation .",

I have no idea what's good about this. Oh, doesn't Lunchables do a a pizza lunch? There you go, it's kind of like that.So, really what I'm saying is, I guess a lot of people like crunchy pizza, but if you're not one of those people, don't bother.",

I also love the atmosphere; I don't play pool, but the building is gorgeous (I'm a sucker for the tin roof) and the place is lively. The garlic bread isn't really worth it, and the beer selection is kind of lame (all the domestic Big Three bottles you can drink!), which keeps it from five stars, but I like Jupiter's a lot.",

The big-screen TVs are prevalent and made watching the game easy. There are plenty of billiards tables in the summer when the students are gone. The pizza however was only okay. Thin crust, w a passable amount of toppings but no discernible signature taste or style. We also had a salad which was supposed to be Greek but didn't really measure up (no cucumbers, no onions). We'd go back but mostly due to the lack of quality pizza places in town.",

You can watch the kids in the arcade while you sit and eat and drink. There are several large tvs throughout, with every single sports event you can think of. The pool rates are inexpensive at only $6 per hour. The only sketchy issue I had was that there was a back entrance which led into a room where horse race betting is going on, and it's close to the arcade.",

I reckon it would be cooler if there was more of an outside 'vibe' there, especially being a block out of the way from the other downtown restaurants... I am still a fan.",

The music is usually good (maybe more trendy for my tastes, but that doesn't take away from it, obsly).  What does, though, is their service.  Super slow.  It's usually _okay_ (the service that is), but I've had a rude bartender or two!  I suppose that comes with the rush of a fast paced and crowded bar on a Saturday night.All in all, I wouldn't say Jupiter is extremely outstanding, or extremely poor.  It's just a run of the mill bar in downtown Champaign (though, it could pretty much be places anywhere).  It offers some great entertainment, with some good refreshment (albeit expensive!!), with the option of a thin crust pizza!  Totally a three-starer!",

I really liked the atmosphere of the bar. It was a great place to watch the game I think next time but will just go for drinks since I didn't think the food was so great. I ordered the salmon slider and the salmon was so salty it was inedible. The other slider I ordered was okay nothing to rave about but the worst was the California turkey burger my friend ordered. The menu said it had avocado on it which it did but it was such a minuscule amount we literally cracked up about it.Its a clean bar and quiet enough to watch a game AND still hear the commentary but you might want to eat before you get there though.",

Now the sliders were wonderful, especially the brat slider. And I had a can of the best cider I ever tasted... I think it was Vander Mill Totally Roasted. It's brewed with candied pecans, but it's very dry and the pecans add a delicious nutty edge. The service and atmosphere were terrific!",

We ordered the cheese curds for an appetizer, and I had a grilled chicken slider with the goat cheese salad. I absolutely recommend the cheese curds - they were my favorite part of the meal. The slider was a little dry for me, but the salad was very good! Our server was very friendly and quick, and the location is perfect if you work near downtown Champaign. From what I saw inside the restaurant, it looked like a pretty calm atmosphere. Outside seating is very good! Overall, if you're looking for a lunch place, Seven Saints is a great choice. They offer a wide variety of options to fit almost anyone's palate!",

It's also the place I recommend when people from out of town ask where they should go for dinner. The service there is very friendly and prompt, and the food is good. I've never had the salmon burgers, but I wouldn't expect the fish dishes to be the best in the heart of Central Illinois anyway. The Buffalo Chicken Slider and Classic Slider with Cheese are my favorites, along with a side of waffle fries (although if you're a fan of sweet potato fries, they have the best in town). The chipotle ranch sauce that comes with the onion rings is amazing, the tomato bisque is absolutely out of this world and they have a great selection of whiskey and beer at the bar. I really think of this place as more of a restaurant than a bar though. They tend to get busy on Friday and Saturday nights, and if the wait is long, make sure you're back earlier than you think if you decide to walk around the area. Definitely one of the gems in Champaign-Urbana and a place that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good meal at a decent price.",

I believe this is a new menu item which comes with 2 giant soft pretzels, mustard for dipping, and an amazing jalepeno cheese sauce. The pretzel was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of salt. I could have eaten a bowl of that jalepeno cheese sauce.Main course: I love it when restaurants allow you to combine menu items, like any variety of a soup/ salad/ sandwich combo. At SS, you can definitely create a combo to your liking. I ordered the soup with half sandwich. The price and quality just blew my mind. You think a tomato bisque soup is boring? Seven Saints will change that opinion of yours! I got that tomato bisque soup with half a tuna melt sandwich and i was in food heaven.Dessert: It's very rare that I have room in my stomach for an appetizer, main course, and dessert. Well, I didn't have room, but that didn't stop me from ordering a sweet sensation. The blueberry cheesecake with ginger crust was absolutely incredible, and I don't regret that decision one bit.Service: Impeccable. I ordered an arnold palmer to drink, and I never saw the bottom of my glass. The food was prompt and our server was helpful. Even with the packers vikings game on TV, we had an extremely pleasant time.I know Illinois is known for good food, but man, I was not expecting this amazingness :) A++++++",

I typically came here on a date with the wife when she visited me during graduate school. We had to live separately for two years but enjoyed our evenings here before her flight home out of CMI. Although it's a whisky bar, they had an interesting selection of wine and beer. I always got the Mojo IPA and she got her Riesling. Aside from the relationship, this is also where I came to prefunk with the roommate before our Thursday night pubcrawls with the School of LER. Initially, my first roommate introduced me to this place when I first arrived to Champaign. We were paired by Burnham's roommate matching system. He was this smart computer science whiz. We drank here on weekends. He moved on to work for Skype. My second roommate was a Korean born Mexican. He was fluent in Spanish which culturally, he loved whisky. I think I was appointed as his wingman because he was this strange kimchee taco hybrid that was soaked in whisky that came off as a creeper. The Chinese Beijing girls loved him though and our strategies to get him laid all started here at Seven Saints. The irony is that, there was nothing Saint like going on at this establishment when we were there.",

I was even more hopeful when my friend and I walked in. The design of this place is awesome. It's really nice looking with good lighting. It looks trendy and cool. Unfortunately, it's an illusion to cover up the rest of the place. It's a pretty boring menu. It's American cuisine that focuses on slider-sized sandwiches. I had the fried chicken slider, and it was okay. Pretty much just literally fried chicken on a bun. It's not any better than I could have gotten at a fast food place, and for much cheaper. I wish I could have tried more sliders, but we were stopping in before a concert, so it was what it was. It's the kind of restaurant that is made to look like it's trendy but it's really just a normal joint with a nice paint job and design to it, and the ambiance isn't worth the extra price in my opinion. The food isn't bad, just average. What really brings this rating down for me is the staff. The service is absolutely terrible. First of all, it was so slow. We ordered one slider each, it shouldn't take that long, especially when the restaurant is packed. Not only was our waitress slow, but she was unbelievably rude. The friend that I went with is male. I, obviously, am female. I might as well have not existed. All of the questions, flirtations, \"are you okays?\" were directed at him, and when I said anything, I got an eye roll and a curt nod. I get it. Guys will probably tip you better. But that's no reason to just blatantly be a terrible server, because we obviously came in together, so you should probably be nice to us together. He was embarrassed for both of us, and made a point to try and ask me questions in front of her, but she just was not getting the hint. It was awkward for both of us, and helped to ruin an otherwise lovely evening out. I'd try this place again maybe if I'm ever in the neighborhood again, but I'd definitely be careful about in whose section I was seated. The second star of this review is for atmosphere alone.",

Finally my co-workers decided to make this the weekly spot to go out to eat, so I was more than happy to tag along.  We went around 12 noon, on a weekday.  The inside is pretty cozy and nicely decorated.  It's almost imperial looking with the large hanging drapes as curtains.  We had a large group of 10, and fortunately we were able to get a table.  The place itself seems very large, as there were from what I could tell, 3 distinct areas to sit in, and an outside dining area as well.All and all though, the place came across as very average to me once everything was said and done.   Granted the restaurant was pretty busy, it took our server literally 15 minutes to come get our order, and another 15 to just get our drinks (and most of us just had water).The food did not take too long to come out, but once again I wasn't impressed at all.  I got the club sandwich with waffle fries, and I can't say it was bad at all, but there was just not a thing special about it.  It's your typical greasy fare typee of place too... Fries oozing grease, bread and buns slathered with butter, etc.  I also tried some of the cheese curds (sounds disgusting, but quickly found out it's just like a round mozerella stick), waffle fries, sweet potato fries, and a classic slider (which apparently is what they are known for... sliders that is)  All of it was just very average, and even the acclaimed slider was nothing special.  I would probably not go here again if I had the choice, but other than I long wait to get waited on and an even longer one to get some drinks, there is really nothing too major I can dock the restaurant for other than it just did not appeal to me much personally.  I should note our server was very friendly, but I just can't really get into the food.  Just a very average joint.",

The manager is incredibly knowledgeable about different hard liquors and cocktails, especially. I've been to a couple tastings there where he has gone through how things are made and why they taste the way they do. He's super cool.The whiskey selection is top notch, the beer selection is respectable, and the ambiance is great.I've also had some of their other food, some of the sliders are really delicious as well as the salads. There are still some items that don't belong on the menu but the majority of their food is great.I would definitely recommend this place to others. Yum.",

I feel the prices are a little high to pay for average food.The atmosphere is dark and intimate because of the booth seating; but it is loud and often busy so the service is so-so. There is also outdoor seating but it is right on a downtown street so it can be busy. Bike parking is also right there in front so while it is convenient for cyclists, it can get in the way of the outdoor seating. For autos, there's metered street parking and a pay-to-park lot across the street.",

                "review": "This is one of my favorite local restaurants in CU. First of all, the atmosphere is really amazing. A lot of care was taken to make the inside of this place something special. It has a slightly dark, gothic feel yet it still feels very cozy and inviting. I do wish the space was a bit bigger, however, as it can get busy very quickly and you'll run out of places to sit.Service-wise I've almost always had great service. The wait-staff is friendly and the bartenders are fast and responsive. They have a nice selection of spirits. The best part has to be the food, though. They have a nice selection of salads. My absolute favorite is the Seven Saints Salad. I've never tasted anything quite like it. It has a crisp bed of greens topped with tiny hot green peppers and a VERY generous portion of pieces of steak. The steak is flavorful and moist and the whole salad has a clear dressing that compliments the other components perfectly. The best part is that you can have the salad as part of a special served with a couple of their sliders for around $8. It's a great deal.Speaking of their sliders, they have a really wonderful selection of mini-hamburgers. They aren't as heavily greasy as you might expect from a traditional slider. My favorites are probably the Asian slider with it's wasabi spread, the Buffalo Chicken slider (with an amazing sauce on a crispy piece of chicken and served with ranch dip) and the Blacjack burger. There are a ton more and pretty much anything to suit your taste.Another standout aspect of Seven Saints are their appetizers. If I have one complaint it's that they seem incapable of keeping their Beet Chips ready to order. Out of the five times I've tried to order them, I've only ever been able to get them twice. I don't know if I've just had bad timing or what but I do wish they were a bit more diligent with those. If you do manage to order them they are delicious and are served with a yummy goat cheese dip. If they are out of them, there are still a lot of great options. You can't go wrong with either of their mushroom appetizers.",

I was told they were famous for their sliders, so I chose the Chicago Dog slider, mainly because I love Chicago Dogs and also because it was out of the ordinary. The slider was very good, but a little overpriced. Not wanting to fill up on just sliders, I also got the Chipotle salad which was very well done and was tasty and surprisingly filling for a salad. I enjoyed the atmosphere- relaxed with good music playing. The waiter was friendly, but not very attentive, especially considering it was not that busy. I had to ask several times just to get a refill on my water. I often judge a place by asking myself if I would go back again.  For Seven Saints, the answer would be yes, if I happened to be in the area, but I wouldn't go way out of my way to get there.",

They have about 8 or so different kinds and since they're relatively small you can comfortably have 2-3 of them in one meal.  Top that off with some waffle fries and ranch dressing and I'm the happiest camper.",

It's just.. it's so good. I've always been a ribeye steak fan, and in my teens when I first learned they make sandwiches out of them, I think I cried tears of joy. Ever since my first bite, I've been on the hunt for the next best ribeye sandwich.. and my friends, I search no more.I order mine blackened, medium-rare, with their delicious waffle fries. The first time I decided on this sandwich, I didn't have high expectations. I had ordered sliders here in the past and found them just okay. However, when they brought out my huge, melty, tender, delicious sandwich, I could hear the angels singing. It was GLORIOUS. I ate every single bite, and within 2 days I found myself back at Seven Saints, ordering another. This is my all time favorite steak sandwich, and I order it often.Aside from this amazing sandwich, the service is always good and the atmosphere is friendly and inviting. They even have ginger ale on tap, YES! Anytime I've been less than 100% satisfied, the staff has been completely accommodating and has removed any problem item from the bill, AFTER replacing it for me. I couldn't have better things to say about this establishment!",

Everything is very clean, and spotless. There is a wood bar and lots of tables and booths abound. Again, very nice and clean. Not a lot of character, but enjoyable.The quality is fine. Nothing wrong with the taps or bottles. The service is decent as far as taking orders and knowing what they have. Though I had to argue with several bartenders to get a half pint of a Barleywine. I don't know why that should be an argument?The food is decent. Though I am not really a fan of everything being a \"slider.\" That makes a lot of the menu a la cart. My first visit, I ended up with a steak salad, but there was not much steak to be seen. What was there was tough and chewy.  The salad was a bit slimy as well.  The sliders are nothing bad, they just never seem to live up to what I would expect from the description.Besides a few decent offerings, the tap list is pretty generic. Eight taps that consist of Blue Moon, Fat Tire Guinness, Magic Hat, some BMC, Southern Tier Seasonal, and a managers choice (Arcadia Barleywine when I first visited).  That rotates a bit, so the selection does change.  The bottle list somewhat makes up for the sub par tap list. Mostly the usual suspects like Rogue, Bells, Goose Island, Founders, etc. Overall decent, but not ground breaking (considering the handful of really good beer bars in walking distance).Overall, just an average place to grab a beer and a meal. A slightly above average beer selection, and slightly above average food. There is really nothing that distinguishes this place above the many other restaurant in the area, and there are much better beer bars in the area without a doubt.",

The salad I got - country fried chicken - was AMAZING. Their honey mustard dressing is light and tangy. I loved the many julienned red onion and cucumber and half cherry tomaotes! By far my favorite part of the meal. Now. The iced tea. Nuh-uh. Is NOT raspberry flavored. Very small cup for the price.I stole my sister's sweet potato fries and eh... Guido's has better. Seven Saint's fries are overly crunchy and weirdly shaped.My friend said the beer selection, though large, didn't have what he really wanted. Also, he said the Seven Saint's salad is a little...offputting. The lime and nut and fruit combo did not a salad make.The actual restaurant was pretty nice. Clean tables. The barstools weren't uncomfortably high. The service was nice, but slow. The server forgot my friend's beer, and was late with the drinks, but was very cheerful and helpful.

I'd say it's more for an older crowd or at least a more relaxed one. The variety of beer and wine is awesome. I thought the sliders there were delicious, same with the soups and salads. Of all of the bars downtown, this one definitely has the best food.The actual atmosphere on the other hand is really nice. There are old pews, vintage chandeliers, and a beautiful wooden piece in the back of the main room all from old Churches, and it was the 7th bar opened by the owner, hence the name Seven Saints. It's all pretty cute and makes a nice place to have an outside dinner. I'd recommend it for sure!",

I wish they had a \"slider flight\" option where you get a deal for 3 sliders or something. The service was prompt and friendly even with our large group. The sliders were.....okay......the bread was kind of mushy and not impressive. The garnishes were more like the quality you'd see at Subway and the beef reminded me of Wendy's or White Castle. Is it the shape, dense texture, or just general tastelessness? I can't quite put my finger on it but it's just not impressive considering its their \"specialty\". The prices are okay but considering that you could probably get better burgers at a fast food restaurant, I feel like they could be cheaper but I guess you're paying for the ambiance and service. Personally, I don't need ambiance, I go out to enjoy unique, high quality food. Ideally, rather than cheaper prices, I think just higher quality food would make more sense. On the plus side, I could see this place being good for picky eaters who are repelled by too many flavors in their food.",

Perhaps the owners need to start dropping back in or have people mystery shop the place.The menu - while not wildly innovative - was well thought out. The appetizers are well done and set up to share, though the fried portabella mushroom strips on the Seven Sinners plate had that 'I've sat in cold storage' flavor to them. That said, the cheese curds and also the beet chips were excellent. I liked the sliders - favoring the blackjack and the buffalo chicken slider. The triple-S plate used to be more of a deal when they would allow you to get two sliders and either a soup or salad. I was sorry to see that go. I've not tried the specials, and each time I've been everyone has done sliders, sandwiches, soup, or salads - so I cant speak to them. The desserts are nothing special, but were decently presented.Out first few trips, the staff was excellent.  We were seated relatively quickly despite being packed. Someone came to take our drink orders in the first few minutes. The waitress was willing to explain things to my party and make substitutions to satisfy vegetarian friends. The beer selection was decent and the mixed drinks were decently strong. While prices were a bit on the steep side, we were fairly happy. On a later trip, the service was slow, the raspberry iced tea was short on the raspberry syrup, and to be frank - I felt rushed out the door once we were done with our entree. That was too bad as the people I was with are the sort prone to ordering dessert and a couple rounds of drinks. If the place was crowded, I could have understood, but it seemed sort of empty.Other reviews have mentioned a chain-like feel. It's true the same group owns a few other local bars - so I'm assuming they use the same architects, designers, and back-office staff. That said, I kind of like the decor and think with a little work on the service Seven Saints could warrant four stars.",

I love the ambiance of the corner bar, dark wood, and dimly lit interior and the extensive offerings of specialty vodkas, gins, and whiskeys.  The cheese curd appetizer was very good but not out of this world.  The beer batter was a little soft and I suspect the cheese had not been frozen prior to deep frying (or not completely), which resulted in most of the cheese over-melting and dripping out of the solidified batter shell.  Still tasty, but missing the mark a little bit.  The sliders were pretty good, but the BBQ had too much botte-tasting sauce on it.  The beef was cooked perfectly though.  Caesar salad was average at best.  On the plus side, they have a nice selection of draft and bottled beer.",

I had the original slider, which was flavorful and juicy, and the buffalo chicken one, which was also delicious. I shared the onion rings with my boyfriend and the 2 sliders which had me slightly full. Though I didn't get anything to drink that day, their menu was very extensive, which had me impressed. Definitely gonna come back for the cheese curds and possibly a drink... some time in the future.",

One salmon slider. BLT salad (although I have also tried the Country Fried Chicken Salad... sounds weird but was really tasty). And the tomato basil soup. This is a trifecta of yumminess in my tumminess. There has only been once when the food all tasted kind of off, possibly a bad day. But every year, it always pleases me. And the bill isn't so bad. I don't really drink here, but have had a mojito that was alright, nothing special. I will continue frequenting this establishment for my yearly Christmas visiting. Please stay in business Seven Saints, otherwise I will be forced to make this food on my own and it won't be pretty.",

If you are looking for a dinner cure to your manic Monday I would totally suggest Seven Saints! The steak was cooked a perfect medium per my request and was served with broccoli and mashed potatoes. I think the 1/2 off wine bottle speaks for itself. Iggy was my server for the evening and he gave us the best service even though we arrived 30 minutes before the kitchen closed which was 11pm.

The train got in over an hour late (which seems to be a common occurrence on this route), but I was still a few hours early for the game, so I grabbed some lunch at this place, which is right across the street from the Amtrak station. I was happy to see that it was not jam packed on game day morning. I was by myself so I sat at the bar. I was impressed with the large selection of beers available, both on tap and by the bottle. I'm used to Chicago prices, so being able to get a good draft beer for under 5 bucks was great. They also have Miller High Life on tap for $2 if you're looking to go \"cheap.\"Food wise, I went with a couple turkey sliders, since the menu claims that is what they are \"famous\" for. I also had some of the sweet potato fries. The sliders were just okay, I wasn't blown away by them or anything. Same thing with the fries. The portion was large, but I wasn't crazy about them (I went ahead and doused them in ketchup after I realized they weren't that good). It was a meal that was adequate, and not expensive (each slider was $2.50 and the fries were $1.99 if I am remembering correctly), so I'm not complaining. My total for 2 draft beers, the food, and tip was just over $20.The bartender introduced himself as \"Billy Mays\" and had on an Oxyclean shirt, which was his Halloween costume. He was nice enough and occasionally engaged in small talk, even as the place started to get more crowded. I didn't have any problems with him keeping my water and beer full, and my food was correct, so no issues there.When all is said and done, I can't give this place 5 stars simply because I wasn't blown away by anything. But this is definitely a sold 4 star establishment.",

You can expect to see draft, seasonal beers for $4, and other beers for cheaper. There are tons of draft and bottled choices. This place has a great bar to sit, watch games, and enjoy an ice cold brew.Service: I was only with one other person so we asked to sit (and eat) at the bar. We had 2,3 staff members (bar tenders) help each other out when it came to waiting on us. They have a team approach- which leads to faster service. The bartenders knew their Illini sports, cared about the downtown Champaign environment by knowing about that weekend's events, and were very down to earth.Overall: I had a fantastic meal, including appetizers, and a beer for $21. A similar place in Chicago would be double that- and the food wouldn't be better either. Downtown Champaign has fantastic bars and eats, and this place is one of them. Seven Saints covers all of the bases- i've eaten here with my family for special occasions, and i've come here in the wee hours of the morning to get my drink on.",

And what's funny is the bartender was like purposely ignoring us. There's no way she didn't see us politely flagging her down. She had a soft drink that she was drinking, and she stopped right in front of us, took a nice looooong drink... kind of relaxing, then she looked past us out the window, and proceeded to ignore us a bit longer. And its not like we were just standing there, you can try and flag them down, but they just ignore you like alien possessed humans staring into space or something. The bartender finally asked what we wanted, but by then we were being seated so we said nevermind. Then we proceeded to have terrible service at our table, to the point that it was just kind of amusing. Oh and my cobb salad had these huge mushroom tentacle things that made me gag and we just sorta wiggled them at our friends like \"look at this huge sick thing that's in my salad!\" And the sliders are way over priced. The cheese curds were good, but a little heavy. I say the place has potential because it's a really nice location and the inside has a nice ambiance.

Both times we received unfriendly and inattentive service. I figured my first visit was an anomaly and found out from those that I visited with that the service is consistently bad. The food: the cheese curds are okay. I'm not sure why everyone thinks they are so incredible? Maybe the massive size? The sliders are pretty good, but I don't think the quality warrants the price. I had the black and blue salad and it was a huge portion for a half size which was awesome! But the taste was not there. It was pretty awful. I couldn't eat it and just enjoyed my baby sized burger instead. The best time to come would probably be Whiskey Wednesday. Come drunk and get drunker and the terrible food and service won't be an issue.",

So not worth it- flavorless and disgusting.  Kinda like how I feel about everything else I have ordered there.  OK for drinks, but avoid the food. Oh, and don't bother complaining to the GM, Andy.

I truly believe they need to decided which one they are. The menu is confusing and to extensive. They have a lot of options and the combinations are limiting. I got a Black and Blue Salad and my husband tried the bratwurst slider and the fried chicken slider. The fried chicken slider tastes exactly like a McChicken!!! Truly amazing.... Only the real thing is bigger. The bratwurst slider was ok. The meat was good, the bread was soggy and the sauerkraut was lacking in crunch. My salad was ok in flavor. The meat was microwaved and had no crispy ends... Clearly reheated. The mushrooms were soggy and had the same look as large slugs. The soup tasted great!!!! But after asking if it was homemade, our server said it was bagged. We were offered the shrimp tacos, but the shrimp is previously frozen too. I'm still disappointed in Seven Saints. They need to decide what they are. A fancy bar or an American lunch spot, they can't be both. It's not working.  I would love to see the mood lightened and the have a fantastic sandwich shop instead!! Or, simplify the menu, make it classy and keep the dark dinner atmosphere. Sorry I can't do better, but I don't lie in my reviews.",

We got there around 8pm. I knew this place was usually busy but when we put our name in, they said it would take 30 minutes. So we figured we would wait since we had not been there in a long time. After an hour of waiting, they were able to seat 6 people. The other 6 had to wait for an adjacent table to open up. It did not open up for another 30 minutes. So I was just really confused on how they would tell us it would take 30 minutes when really it took 1 hour and 30 minutes. The first half of our group had already ordered for us in an attempt to save some time since everyone was starving. After we were seated, it took about 10 minutes for our server to come ask us what we wanted to drink, and then another 10 minutes to actually get our drinks. The food was alright. I usually get different sliders, but decided to try the steak sandwich. It was pretty good, a little messy though since there was a ton of oil that came with it. After we finished, the guy took all of our plates, and then it took 10 minutes for him to ask us if we were ready for the check. then it took him another 10 minutes to get us the check. And then another 10 minutes to charge all the cards. That was one of the worst dining experiences I've had. Over 2 hours of just waiting for things. You would think that with a larger group, he would have paid more attention to us but guess it doesn't work that way.Like I said earlier, I've been here before and they were ok experiences, which accounts for the 2nd star. But we'll see if I ever go back in the near future. Just pissed that we waited so long when the server kept saying it would be 5-10 more minutes every time we asked.",

I've never heard any complaints or noticed any discrimination or racism. People are overwhelmingly happy with their experiences here, as evidenced by how busy it is. Wednesdays do tend to get hectic, so if you are high-maintenance / demanding / have a chip on your shoulder, you may want to pick a different night to go. If you're a normal person like 99% of the other people around, you'll have a good time.With that out of the way, Seven Saints is THE PLACE to drink whiskey, especially on Wednesday, with a 1/2-price special on one of four rotating themes. Every whiskey they have is in one of the themes and will be 1/2-price on its respective day. They have an incredible selection with a whole menu page or two for each theme. The bartenders that work that night are passionate about whiskey and it shows. They know their stuff and can always make a good recommendation based on what you like, tell you why they recommend it for you, tell you what to look for, and answer any questions.",

But this place is a sanctuary for the rest of us who just like to drink whiskey and eat tiny burgers with our friends. I highly suggest the salmon sliders although at $4 a pop they are pretty costly. I pretty much only come on whiskey Wednesdays so I can sample the best that they have. The waiters are always really helpful and will suggest whiskey for you to try even if you're not used to drinking them. Seating can be limited depending on what time you come but if you can grab a table outside during the cooler nights of summer, you'll never find a better place. It is on university so it can be a bit noisy due to traffic.",

On a Sunday evening, we were seated outside immediately and our waiter was accommodating and attentive without hovering.  We each ended up going with the slider and salad combo with sweet potato fries on the side.  I chose the salmon slider (complete with cucumber and dill sauce) and the salmon salad (a more Mexican take with a southwest ranch dressing) & I was extremely content with my choices; even having some leftovers for lunch the next day! In my opinion, the portions were definitely very reasonable.  The sliders were about the size of the diameter of a standard water or beer glass or at least that is what our waiter told us! Seven Saints ended up being the perfect spot to catch up with old friends over some delicious food; I'd definitely recommend this joint to anyone with a rumbling tummy in downtown Chambana!",

Yes, there are finer restaurants in CU, yes there are cheaper bars, and yes there are better crowds, however I sure enjoyed the hell out of my last trip. Here's why: they have an excellent liquor selection with a focus on Irish, Scotch, and Bourbon Whiskies. Their food menu has a nice balance of innovation and old standards and was well-executed for everything our group of 6 ordered. Service is quick (turn and burn, baby!) even when they're full. If you are careful, the food and drink is actually quite reasonably priced: soup/sandwich combo, 2x beers, huge club with excellent sweet potato fries all for $30 (whiskey tab was a different story- but worth it). You certainly could spend more on you food here, but if you get the cheap stuff you will still be happy. Also, on Wednesdays, they have HALF price on all their whisky/ey!The bartender also runs classes on the appreciation of this complex but enthralling (some would even say intoxicating) beverage.",

The fact that we have not been back since then probably implies something.We had some pretty darn good onion rings for an appetizer. My wife had a Tomato Pesto Grilled Cheese sandwich that we thought was pretty good, along with a nice Tomato Bisque. I had a trio of Sliders: Asian, Tropical Stack, and Salmon, served with Sweet Potatoe Fries.I grew up in an area that had White Castle restaurants. Now, I never went there unless pressed, but I do know what a slider is.The problem with these was not the taste, which was fine. Nor the size, which was small. The problem is that sliders are moist / greasy. Now, I'm not saying that having a non-greasy slider is a bad thing from a healthful eating perspective. But if you're going to call something a slider, there has to be something non-dry about it. sigh.Service was friendly.I would like to get back there and try some other items, but we always seem to think of someplace else we'd rather eat.",

The crowd was what looked like a mix of graduate students and older couples.Seven Saints is known for their sliders, these mini burgers, kinda like what White Castle serves. The sliders are about $3 to $4 bucks each so it's perfect for ordering a slew of them. I ordered fried cheese curds  for appetizers which were delicious though a little soggy (then again, anything fried pretty much tastes good). There are plenty of vegetarian options. Any slider can be replaced with a boca burger (50 cents extra), but in my opinion a boca burger patty overwhelms any other taste. So what you end up with is pretty same tasting burgers - my boca blackjack cheese slider tasted like my Asian one. The waffle fries were especially good though (better than The Office's ones in Urbana IMO). The beer selection is limited so this place is decent to take group for dinner - there are better bar options for drinks elsewhere. The service was adequate and attentive, but not overly so. What's with the Third Eye Blind love? There were like 3 TEB songs that played that night :S There's also some outdoor seating. I could definitely image coming back here for lunch.I also like the fact that Seven Saints is directly across from the bus/train station (who needs to spend 10 bucks on a cab when there's convenient public transportation nearby? My friends rode their bikes here and took a bus back home (they have racks on the front of the bus to load bikes).All in all, Seven Saints is a decent option for lunch and dinner, but you can find better spirits elsewhere (i.e. Blind Pig, others)",

I'm boring and stick to the bacon ones, but on occasion I branch out; the tropical ones are also really good. What really sets this place apart are the chicken tenders, which are the best I've ever tried. They're reasonably priced and listed on the appetizer menu, but totally worth getting as a main course. The tomato bisque is apparently very good as well (but screw tomatoes, I'm sticking with the food).As good as the food is, the bar is even better. While the drinks are a bit expensive, if you come on Wednesday, various whiskeys are half off. They also have specials on Monday and Tuesday for wine and beer, respectively. I love the bar selection, though. Wednesdays are my favorite day, because I come to Seven Saints and try various whiskeys to sort out my likes and dislikes. If you (or someone you know) is trying to get into whiskey, this is a great place to do it. My personal favorites are the Elmer T. Lee and the various shades of Pappy they have (especially the Old Rip Van Winkle which is fantastic). My only quibble is that the whiskey passports are a bit of a ripoff. It's $5 for the little book, but normally that'd also come with some sort of swag (like a t-shirt or glass) when finished. It'd make a nice little memento for finishing the entire (64 entry) passport. Still, a great place and such a minor nitpick it barely merits mentioning. Seven Saints is fantastic.",

Well we sat for 20 min and no waitress. There were three outside but no one stopped at our table. I finally stopped the young man at the front door and he quickly found us someone to take our order. Hey everybody has an off night! My husband and I enjoy not the run of the mill beers and we were surprised to find extensive selection at seven saints. Goose island 312 for me and fat tire for my spouse.We started our dinner off with fried cheese curds. The cheese curds were golden brown and not greasy,they come highly recommended!We each ordered 2 sliders and a side of waffle fries. I had Asian and smoked BBQ slider and Doug ordered BBQ and California turkey slider. All were cooked to perfection and delicious . They have several options when it comes to the menu so I feel there is something for everyone. All in all we had a wonderful dining experience and our waitress( once we got one) was on the ball and friendly. We will be returning and I would recommend Seven Saints to our friends.",

Also, I really love the rib eye steak sandwich, its pricey ($10), but its amazing and it comes with a side (onion rings are killers in here).There is also the possibility of ordering combos with salad, soup, etc... I never had that, but I heard its pretty good.Bottom line: this place is a MUST in Champaign. During weekend it might get crowded and with a waiting line, usually I go by myself, so I never had that problem.",

This would be okay if they hadn't hidden the drafts behind columns such that it's impossible to discover what types of beer they have.The food menu was more promising.  It's split into two parts:  half the items were ripped off from Crane Alley (beet chips with goat cheese, sweet potato fries, cajun crab cake) and the other half are \"sliders\".  Upscale White Castle.Frankly, the food wasn't particularly bad.  My friend enjoyed his salad.  But it wasn't particularly good either:  his slider was only so-so and my sandwich was like a salt lick.  But I probably would have gone back just to break up the monotony of eating downtown if the service hadn't sucked.When our waitress finally got around to us, I ordered a sandwich.  She came back five minutes later to tell me that there had been a \"permanent substitution\" with that item.  By substitution, she meant that it was nothing at all like the description - perhaps it still had the same kind of bread.When I told her I didn't want this new sandwich, she made a big deal out of me being \"too picky,\" and telling me that the kitchen was now going to be mad at her.\"Permanent substitution\"?

I got a tuna salad sandwich with cheese melted onto one of the pieces of bread. Not much tuna melt action. Eye of the beholder though, I get that.

Fried mushrooms, cheese curds, onion rings--they're all good and don't make you feel gross afterwards like some other places do.The salads are big and hearty. Sliders offer lots of options. And their menu allows you to mix and match things to meet your taste. Personally I like the red pepper gouda soup when they have it and the southwest chipotle chicken salad.

What follows is my progression.My first visit was mostly about the drinks.  I found the beer menu to be decent (which is what I felt like drinking that night).  I know I ordered food and I was not displeased with it.  Overall, my first experience was good and I came back for more.  My next visit included food and drinks.  I went with some sort of mixed drink that tasted fine but was not memorable.  I had the salmon slider to eat.  I did not notice if the menu listed what came with the slider or not, and the waitress did not bother to mention that the slider come with just the sandwich.  When I got my slider I realized that one mini sized salmon sandwich was not going to be enough for dinner.  Sadly, I started eating the slider before I ordered more food.  I can only describe it as a salty salmon puck.  After that, I was no longer hungry, and we went elsewhere.I returned for lunch, and had the BLT salad with the tomato soup.  I recommend both options.  The soup was so good that I came back for lunch again and paired it with the tomato pesto grilled cheese.  This was also wonderful.  In fact it was so good that I found myself craving the soup and grilled cheese one day so I went for lunch.  Now, I am not a fan of swiss cheese which is one of the cheeses in the sandwich.  I requested that the swiss cheese be replaced with provolone instead.  When I got my sandwich there was no swiss cheese, but there was no other cheese on the sandwich.  There should have been American cheese as well.  I guess the server misunderstood my request, and I figured it was an honest mistake so I didn't think it was a big deal.The last straw was yesterday.  I went for lunch again and ordered the tomato pesto grilled cheese with the tomato soup.  Again I requested that the swiss be replaced with provolone.  When I got my sandwich it was more like toast than a grilled cheese.  There was one slice of American cheese and one slice of provolone cheese on each piece of bread, but the cheese was not melty and gooey.  It was toasted and crispy.  Then the pesto was glopped on in one cold dollop.  I found the sandwich to be dry. From now on I will probably only go to this place for the drinks.  Too bad I can find drinks at just about any bar in town.  I feel let down because I really wanted to like this place.  I love the look and feel of the bar, and it has all the potential to be great.  However, if they can't even accomplish a grilled cheese sandwich why would you want to eat their food?",

Small-ish portions:  At $10 for the above-mentioned meal, I felt a little.....unsatisfied.  The sliders seem pricey at  $3+ a pop, too.  2.  Service:  A bit slow.  It picked up when we started strictly drinking, but there was nary a condiment to be found during our meal.  All in all, I'd head back.  It's a nice joint in downtown Champaign.",

I think it's weird to have grilled onions in a salad.  Maybe it's me but it's just not right.The mushroom sandwich was soggy and not very good.  Actually the mushrooms were just fine but putting it together in a sandwich with cheese and red peppers just didn't do it for me.  They do not go together in my opinion. Basically, I found both items odd.The server was great and the food came out fast I will give them credit for that.

On a Saturday night on the outdoor patio I heard them play The Avalanches, Rob Dougan, Gorillaz, Lindsey Stirling and many more amazing artists that just happen to be in my favorite genre. I don't know if it was a streaming service or a custom playlist but they should continue with it. The wait staff are cute, and they do a good job. I really like Seven Saints.",

Ordered the Cheese Curds as an appetizer, my gf ordered the Tomato Pesto Grilled Cheese and I had the Ribeye Steak sandwich.  We both had two drinks with our dinner...Cheese curds came before the meal and they turned out to be pretty good.  Nothing to rave about, but average.  At last, our meal was delivered.  The bun for my Ribeye sandwich turned out to be what looked like Texas toast.  As I peeled back the bread to look at my sandwich, I was in for a huge let down!  This was the absolute worst excuse for a ribeye steak sandwich.  My biggest complaint, it was paper thin!  PAPER THIN!!!  Literately speaking, my steak was no thicker than a cardboard coaster.  The price tag on this steak sandwich was $10.  This is my biggest pet peeves when it comes to steak sandwiches...I don't mind paying upwards of $15 for a steak sandwich, but I expect good quality!   This was such a poor excuse for ribeye, I had to eat it with the top piece of toast off, just to taste the meat.  How dare they insult their customers with such a poor excuse for a steak sandwich!  My gf equally hated her grilled cheese for reasons she will explain in her own review.Once the check arrived, ($52) we asked to speak with the manager.  We both expressed our concerns with Andy, the manager.  We felt like after spending $50, we should leave the restaurant full and satisfied.  Instead, we were leaving hungry, miserable, and downright insulted!  Andy rattled off various reason as to why my steak might have been a little on the thin side.  He apologized for the size of the steak, and offered us 2 free drinks to make up for our poor experience.  REALLY???  We spent over $50 and all he was going to do was give us two free drinks?  No thanks!  We refused the free drinks, and made sure he knew he just lost two customers for good.I'm not looking for a handout!  I'm not looking for my money back...but the way he handled our situation was horrible!  If a customer spends $50 in your restaurant and absolutely hated the food, two drinks is not enough to make up for this!  I expected a credit or a gift card to come back and give Seven Saints another chance.  Now, I will never be back!  I can find steak sandwiches comparable to the one I had at Seven Saints at Taffies or Steak n Shake!  Keep your two free drinks!  Just know we will spread the word to anyone who will listen!  I hope you handle future situations better.",

If you don't know what that is, then you have to make sure you check out ALL of the discount alcohol nights at Seven Saints because they are all deals you should take advantage of!The whiskey I got was Snake River Stampede. Mainly because I thought it was funny that it was considered a \"rodeo whiskey\" and also that the description for it said \"this whisky can still kick like a bucking bronco when served neat.\" haha.Another nice thing is that they alcohol menu has two featured House drinks and a description for both. This makes it a bit easier while choosing a drink and you don't have to ask the waitress/waiter about every single drink. Even though my server was nice enough to do it if asked.I got the Triple \"S\" Platter (Slider, 1/2 Salad, and a Side). I got the cheese slider, 1/2 Caesar salad and waffle fries. I liked all the food. Their waffle fries were really good.Up until I tried Seven Saints, I only thought of sliders as the little burgers you get from White Castle, but Seven Saints is now my favorite place to get them.

With plenty of space out and inside, and self-seating, the atmosphere is always semi-casual and always welcoming. After looking at the menu, we expected an average dining experience, based on the fact that the menu accentuates burgers (they call their mini-burgers SLIDERS) and salads...not our usual dining-out fare.However...the wings are the BEST WINGS we have ever had in our lives. They are not your usual buffalo-drowned bits of suspiciously massive chook, these are fine specimens of realistically-sized, expertly-cooked bird, served crispy with your choice of two sauces, (there are lots to choose...from BBQ to Thai Peanut and beyond).In ordering, we found that each ordering the Slider/Salad combo worked really well, although sharing sliders and tasting different flavors also works well. There is an extensive beer/wine selection, including some fashionable Spanish options, however we seriously question a wine list without a single New Zealand option, especially in the Sauvignon Blanc section. Our favorite sliders so far have included the Buffalo Chicken, the BlackJack, the California Turkey and the Salmon, although we highly recommend asking for NO BUTTER on the buns if you are interested in 'eating lightly'. Our two salads (Goat Cheese and Spinach/Fried Chicken Salad) were both surprisingly delicious, after so many below-average iceberg salads in the mid-west.All in all, we think they have found a niche targeting people who appreciate casual dining prepared exceptionally well. This is the PERFECT OPTION for those diners who want a home-town up-scale alternative to Ruby Tuesday, Steak n Shake, Fridays, or perhaps even Guido's at the same price and not at the mall!Expect to spend $30 on food for 2 courses for 2 people.",

I have visited this restaurant twice now, both during the week and on the weekend, and have left feeling very less than satisfied.  The building itself is beautiful, the bar is stunning, the ambiance is lovely, (albeit incredibly loud- so dont go in there expecting to have a conversation with your dinner-mates), but the service is unimpressive.  There are certainly quite a few waiter/waitresses around (enough that i have watched them run into each other) but they never seem to come to my table.  Drinks take too long to be made as well as to reach my table from the bar.  I actually watched my drink sit at the waitress station at the bar with the ice melting in it for a while before it was brought to me.  I had the bavarian pretzels, which were decent by themselves, but the jalepeno sauce served with it was chunky and old, and had thickened to an almost inedible point.   As for the sliders, they were nothing special, and I thought, a bit over-priced for what they were.  I wasnt thrilled about the beef the burgers were made with, and it wasnt seasoned at all.   Absolutely avoid any slider with a Turkey Burger inside, it smelled old and.....stale? rancid? The one shining point of my visits, and the only reason this place gets a second star is because of the cheese curds.  The breading was light and crisp, the cheese had substance, and best of all, they were even delicious re-heated the next day!  The sweet potato chips are also amazing.I want to like this restaurant, but I just cant. This restaurant will never be my suggestion for a C-U dinner option.",

Nice staff, cool decor.I ordered the goat cheese salad (spring greens, grapes, strawberries, goat cheese, sweet roasted walnuts, and fruity vinaigrette) and a salmon slider. The food was decent... Loved the salad, but might not get the salmon again as the flavors just didn't work for me. However, they do substitute boca patties on any of the other sliders for $0.50 extra so I might try that next time.What I really like about this place is the strong drinks! Two drinks and I had a nice buzz, and I'm normally not a two-drink lady. The signature cocktails listed on their menu are pricey, but I ordered a Tom Collins (not on the menu) and it was $3.50, which is pretty good in my book.",

One in particular basically gave us flat soda, when we alerted him of it his response was \"I was hoping you guys wouldn't notice, they're in the middle of changing it. I guess I'll just bring you guys some fresh ones when they're actually done.\" SERIOUSLY?!?! I was appalled. Any ways, the host switched us immediately to a new servers section and understood completely when we asked to move. Other than that interaction I haven't had a negative experience. Can't beat the quality!",

My favorites are the Black Jack slider (pepperjack cheese, grilled onions and ancho aioli topped with fried jalapeos) and the Smokey BBQ slider (cheddar, bbq sauce, fried onion ring).  Good stuff.   The lunch combos are a pretty good deal, which offsets the price issue I mentioned earlier.  I usually get the slider + side + salad combo for lunch (which is about $10), and they have other combinations for that.  I've only had the Caesar salad, and it was fine.  Several of my co-workers have had the salmon slider and said it was good as well.I have tried the crinkle-cut sweet potato fries, which were good but not my personal favorite.  The cheese curds are great (as many others have posted), but you do feel a bit of guilt for eating batter-covered balls of cheese.  It's nearly the epitome of gluttony, and you can feel your arteries harden mid-bite.  We did order the Bavarian Pretzels once also and those were good.Service is usually average, at best, but not worth complaining about much.If it's cold outside, avoid the table near the door!   We went once in February when it was still pretty cold out, and even with a large curtain around the entrance way, we were constantly blasted by cold air when people came in the door.  Even in warm weather it's rather distracting.  We've been seated there twice (maybe it's their only pre-setup table for 8).  I'd recommend asking to sit somewhere away from the door if possible.We'll probably go back.  They have enough variety that it's a nice place to go occasionally.",

It's dark: too dark for any food picture. Feels old/vintage on the inside and has a very cool atmosphere.We started with the Bavarian pretzels and a black & blue salad. The pretzels were really warm and tasty, the salad was also wasn't bad, although kind of skimpy on the ribeye pieces. We each got one of the \"pick X, Y, and Z\" combos. I got an Asian slider with the chicken enchilada soup, and sweet potato fries. It was pretty good, the slider was small, as expected, not quite White Castle size or anything though. I really enjoyed the wasabi flavor of the slaw, but felt it needed more toppings. I did order it with everything on a typical burger (lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle) since the top of the menu said those items were available at your request, but I didn't get any of those items when my food was brought out. I did try my Dad's California turkey slider and thought that was pretty good, too. The soup wasn't bad, although it more resembled a chili in my opinion. Crinkle-cut sweet potato fries were awesome! Seven Saints has an extensive selection of alcohol. I really think they are a bar more so than a restaurant. Lots of exotic, small-batch, local, craft, etc. type liquors, cocktails and beers. I had something called a Dragon's Milk, which was an absolutely delicious stout but pricey at $7.50I forgot our server's name but she did a good job!Overall a little pricey for what it is, but I felt the food was definitely a step up from typical bar/pub food. In my opinion, they should diversify their menu by way of adding some non-sandwich options. I must note that they source most of their meet from Old Time Meat & Deli down the street, which is great, knowing things are a bit more local.I'll be back!",

Seven Saints, as far as I was always concerned, was god-awful expensive.  And for food you could find pretty much anywhere.  Burgers, fries.  Simple standard sandwiches.  Hit or miss, but I'd say, especially for the money, hit up the diner a few blocks away.  You're going to get a much tastier experience, and service with smile.",

The waitstaff is EXTREMELY knowledgable on different liquors and beer.  They are particularly helpful on whiskey and beer, but more than adequate on just about anything else as well.  The only negative thing I can say is they have changed my thoughts on what to expect out of waitstaff, and I have found many other bars/restaurants lacking.The drink list is huge, and new things are constantly being added.  Its very common for there to be a few \"off the list\" specials, particularly on Wednesday nights.  Wednesdays are a great night to go since 1/4 of the whiskey is half off that night in rotation.  I have tasted a ton of different whiskeys I never would have tried if it wasn't for this night.  The waitstaff is always glad to recommend something new based off your criteria, and I have ended up purchasing several bottles from my home bar after trying them at Seven Saints.The food is good, and always comes out quick.  I am particularly fond of the cheese curds, waffle fries, and sweet potato fries.  Most sandwiches are sliders, so don't expect a large sandwich.  They have a deal where you can split soup, salad, and a slider for a good price, that's normally what I choose.  Their caesar salad is great!",

We sat at the bar, and the bartender was very nice and got us our drinks fast.  After we sat down, we realized we should have sat outside because of the beautiful weather, but didn't feel like moving.  I didn't look at the food menu, but a few people I was with ordered food.  Unfortunately, 2 of the 3 orders were wrong.  One friend doesn't red meat, and ordered chicken in her salad, only to bite into a piece of steak.  Another friend said her food was just okay.They had some nice beer choices, and after several years in CA, the prices seemed reasonable.  And actually, I ordered a beer on tap that I didn't end up liking.  The bartender saw that I wasn't drinking it, and asked if I wanted something else.  No problems, no extra charges- it was very considerate.  Granted, I should have asked for a taste before I bought it, but I would have eventually drank it.  It was just an extra bonus that I was able to get something else that I really enjoyed.  Overall, a pleasant experience, and I would recommend it.",

Sliders, salads, sides, desserts... It's all delicious. Definitely try the sweet potato fries or beet chips. My only complaint about the menu is that, since I tend to order vegetarian, the options can get a little stale (though you can sub in a veggie burger on any of their sliders).My favorite meal? California Turkey Slider (sub a veggie burger, hold the bacon), waffle fries, and the Southwest Chipotle Salad.And last, but not least, the atmosphere: Seven Saints feels classy, but not so classy that you'll feel underdressed if you show up in a t0shirt and jeans. It's a darker feel and the furniture and decorations are detailed and thought-out. Even when it's busy, they bar doesn't get too terribly loud so it's great for a date or a night out with friends if you'd like to be able to have a conversation at the table.",

There was nothing wrong with the dishes per se, but there was definitely not anything remarkable. For the portions they were definitely not worth the price. The flavors tended to be fairly bland, and I was really not impressed. The presentation was well done, however. On another note, the martinis were great, and reasonably priced. I got a dirty martini, and substituted Stolichnaya for the Svedka, and it turned out really well. The waiter forgot to specify the vodka change on the second round, and while service was slow, the food came fast once the order was in. The experience was not unpleasant, but I doubt I'll be back. There are better places elsewhere in downtown Champaign.",

Met up a couple of friends here for a drink and ehh it was alright. My mojito was too sour and the leaves are grinded up pretty good so you can sip up a herb and not even know it. I sipped an herb and chewed on it by accident and YACKCKK!! My friend's martini was too strong for her so she asked to have it re-mixed, the waiter said he was too busy but questioned her for 3 minutes about her drink saying he couldn't do it, and wadda-ya-know, he did it! He was friendly overall, however, but saying one thing and then the truth comes out is a slight pet-peeve for me.Environment was nice; music really cranked up at 10 on the dot. Good place to chill and have a few drinks, what i really liked were the prices. They were very moderate and not overpriced. I would come back again but next time i'll pre-drink so I can babysit another mojito that i don't enjoy. :).P.S. I received a follow up message; this goes to show that this restaurant really shows effort to tend to the comforts of the customers. Great service!",

                "review": "My idyllic memories of Boltini are almost assuredly the product of imperfect memory and undiscerning taste, reader beware.  But even the particulars I can recall still sound objectively wonderful.  Metal baby feet for door handles, internally-lit glass panes that trap splays of branches and project Tim Burtonesque shadows on the walls above the intimate circular booths and swank cushions in the recessed lounge, Bells on tap, a full array of top shelf liquors (not normally a special attraction, but it's in Central Illinois after all), and a martini list I used to adore.  This is really where the lovely memory gets shaky:  I was horribly fond of the \"Hollywood\": Absolute Mandarin, Chambord, and orange juice, which now just sounds heinously sweet and I seem to remember them costing far more than I ever wanted to pay for a drink in Champaign.  It makes me wonder if perhaps I would be disappointed were I to return, but I suspect that Boltini is still the only bar in Champaign that manages to be sort of hip, almost pulls off posh, even seems legitimately urbane.  And once in a while, in a college town, that's absolutely worth the slightly higher prices.   Light appetizers are available until 10pm, and the menu aspires to a cheese-plate and pesto bruschetta sort of class, but I never got there early enough to judge the execution.  Oh, and don't miss the doll's head in the banister....and it suddenly occurs to me that maybe I'm just squicky about the dismembered infant parts.  Regardless, four stars.",

Started by sharing a huge bowl of Roasted Red Pepper & Smoked Gouda soup. Towards the bottom of the bowl, it started to get spicy. The spice was nicely counterbalanced by bits of bacon.Next, we shared a generous cheese plate with baguettes and fresh fruits. We chose three cheeses that would not be incorporated into other portions of our meal. Porter Cheese, Goat Cheese, and Bacon-Encrusted Brie. The Brie was excellent. It might be related to my obsession with bacon. I will tell you that somehow I passed on ordering their 12 perfectly cooked pieces of bacon appetizer.Finally, we ordered three small plates. Mushroom crostinis, crab cakes and bacon-wrapped blue affine stuffed dates. Crab cakes had a tropical feel because of a light slaw with fruit incorporated. The dates were delicious but heavy and rich. The portion included six dates. That would be great for six people as one was enough.Great night with great service. However, we got the feeling that we needed to initially command the attention of a server. The restaurant's tables are first come first serve and that chaotic feeling carried over into getting a server's attention that we were at the restaurant to eat and not just drink. If you aren't assertive, you may find it hard to get a table and to get service.",

My two favorites were the artichoke dip and the ahi tuna wonton (but again, I like everything with ahi tuna). The sandwiches were also really good too. We also got all their desserts (they had like 3 to choose from), and I loved the creme brulees. Best of all, the price was surprisingly cheap!The drinks were mostly good. Their beer of the month was good and cheap at $3. Other than that, their drinks fall in the $6-9 range which is a little steep for a town like Champaign. However, they make their drinks really strong, so you kinda have to pace yourself through the drinks.Overall, I like this place a lot. Great ambient, great food, great drinks, reasonable price. It's quite a rarity in Champaign.4 stars if you want to go there for drinks5 stars if you want to go there for dinner (because it's a bargain for the quality of food you get, especially when you have a gift certificate from restaurant.com).",

So yes, Boltini is known for their martinis, but they have quite an awesome (and oft overlooked) beer list.  I got a Shipyard Pumpkin Ale - that stuff's hard to find in Chicago, so points to the C-U mini-metropolis on that one!For dinner, we went with the crab cake appetizer (as a Child of the Chesapeake, I am honor-bound to try any crab dish heralded as \"best in town\").  I must say, this appetizer held its own.  While these were not traditional Chesapeake cakes, they took on a sort of Asian flair with the sauce and the vegetable pairings (I had no idea what to expect when I read that this came with \"Asian Slaw\".  What is that?  Eh, I'm still not sure, but it was delicious).  We definitely cleaned the plate.For my entree, I ordered the Blue Crab salad.  It was basically the appetizer salad-ified.  Without my asking, the dressing was on the side (gold star!).Overall, everything was fresh, tasty, and a touch unexpected (you never know when it comes to \"bar food\").  While their drink menu far surpasses their dinner menu, Boltini is still a decent spot to grab a bite downtown.",

I didn't even know this place had a dinner menu since all their drinks have the spotlight, but it's not too bad, depending on what you get.  For a cold night like this, a selection from their 'hot drinks' looks perfect to warm you up, and someone ordered a 'Peppermint Patty.'  A bunch of others got their $4 specials of Razzmo's and Clementine Cosmo's.  I just stuck with water.But back the the food.  It is cheaper than most of their drinks!  Pastas started at $6.50 and sandwiches were up to $10.  The Liar's Club Sandwich caught my eye because of the raw ahi tuna, avacado, and sriracha aioli sauce.  Everything was tucked inside of a soft sun-dried tomato bun cushioned with a bed of sprouts.  They could have spiced the tuna a bit more, and added some more sriracha.  I was searching for more flavor with each bite and before I knew it the sandwich was gone.It was easy to eat because the softness of the sandwich, but needed a stronger punch ... and maybe some crunch.  My friend had to add hot pepper flakes to everything.  I'd say get the pizza or pesto pasta if you want something that is guaranteed to be good.  Their ahi tuna tacos and \"grown up grilled cheese\" looked interesting.  They have something called the 'Brownie Tower' which is self-explained heaven and served with a shot of chocolate milk.The ambiance is alright, they have cool names for everything and an endless list of classy drinks.  However it's funny I felt like the menu was trying to assure me that eating here made me \"grown up.\" Hence the \"grown up\" grilled cheese or a \"grown up\" shot of chocolate milk.  It's a creative twist to kiddish foods but thanks for the reminder.  A word of advice, order the things that are listed the most on the menu.  The 10 pages of drinks and 5 pages of cheese were no accident.",

It was mentioned to us by the beautiful bride to be to try this place. Wonderful high ceilings, comfy curled couches, interesting bar seats, cute bar staff, (well... okay the girls behind the bar), and a very mixed crowd. But what were we here for? Well, myself and the rest of the crowd wanted a beer, my friend wanted some girls he could hit on. I won. Were there girls he could hit on here? Yes, so don't get me wrong on that account, but not the skanky girls he was interested in. We sat at the bar, I poured over their menu, rather impressive. About 8 to 10 different dirty martinis as well as a multitude of drinks and wines. Plenty of imported and micro brews abound,  Food looked pretty good as well, but my stomach was full from munching earlier, but on the other hand if it wasn't, I would have chowed down. I do have to say the staff behind the bar was hustling their butts off, so I allow the waiting a bit to get some attention to slide. Yet, I didn't understand why the bartenders were also serving tables as well, perhaps some one called in sick. Yet, they were still friendly and even made sure my friend's martini was just right when he said it was too dirty for him.  Even a DJ was spinning some tracks. I do have a weird feeling that this place is trying to do too much, perhaps with the competition of bars in the area they are trying to serve an everything under the sun atmosphere in a more upscale college town. I really liked it and if I ever find myself in town again, I want to stop by here. However I need to find a driver for this town to whisk me away back to my hotel. Finding a cab is harder than finding a Michigan Wolverine fan here.",

I was told it had 'an extensive martini menu,' so of course I had to go!The vibe here was interesting. You could tell it was one of the posher places in town, but it felt like one part dive bar and one part lounge. I must admit I liked the music. They were playing Jamie Cullum as I entered the place.I tried the Pomegranate Martini. It was okay. It was pretty sweet for a martini... but I felt pretty buzzed afterwards. So I'm sure it had a decent amount of alcohol in it.The bathroom was quite nice, though. I would go back and try the food next time. It had several things I would have wanted to try had I not eaten earlier.",

                "review": "A group of us have been coming to Champaign for our work to do some concentrated training 1-2x/month so we wanted to start checking out the local, non-college scene. We checked out Boltini twice, each time deciding on Wed. since it's their half-price-drink night.The first try was a few weeks ago and relatively early in the night I guess (9pm). We all, especially me, really liked the place itself; a loungey, chill vibe. I'm not a beer guy so I was very pleased with their great drink selections AND all 1/2 price! I thought this was a sure winner. It was kinda slow, and the main reason we left that time after only one drink was that the demographics threw us off. After some shifting during the 20mins. or so, there ended up being 5 couples there: all same-sex, 4 of the 5 were guys. Being new to the area, we didn't know if we found ourselves in a gay bar. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that, but it's just not conducive to keeping single straight guys around.This past week we came back because I was assured that it was a place open to all, so I talked the others into trying it again. On this, our second attempt (and third; we ended up coming back later), we got there around 10pm. It was later than the last time so I expected a bit more of a crowd. I guess that's my only complaint about this place. We gave it more of a chance, sticking around for just under an hour. It was worthwhile, but just not getting as active as we hoped. It did seem to start to shift as we were heading out, but he others had decided to move on.We ended up back there an hour later. The scene was about the same as when we were leaving; still just on the brink of happenin'. We stayed for about 45min, and I easily could have spent the rest of the night there but the others wanted to go back to the clubby place we closed at on our previous night.When we go back next week I think I WILL be sticking around if the vibe is right letting the others move on. I really want to love this place cuz it has all the right attributes for me (almost). Here's to hoping my next review will be 5 stars!",

I had the strawberry gimlet, which was a homemade mixture of strawberry puree and vodka, topped off with a healthy pour of chambord ($7.25). I don't usually like paying this much for a cocktail but you really do get what you pay for! The drink did not taste of sugar or artificial strawberries... it tasted fresh and was absolutely fantastic! Also, the drinks are strong. They really aren't messing around. All of the employees were nice and accommodating too! I might not bring the boy for a quiet night out, but for me and my girls, boltini is a nice treat :)",

I expected to find it on their website, but it's not there.Our server was nice and prompt and had several recommendations for our group.Wasn't a fan of the layout.  It's just a long bar with a few booths.  Our booth faced the door to the kitchen, so the dark atmosphere was frequently punctured by the bright light of the kitchen.  That's a small drawback.If you're in this part of town, it's worth dropping in for a killer cocktail.",

We came with a huge group for a friend's birthday and even though all the round tables were taken, the manager sat us at a bar height table and provided us all with barstools to wait for an open table. The manager was AMAZING - so friendly. Even though the bar was completely packed, he still came to check on us throughout the night even after he found us a round table. My wine was delicious and well-priced and after trying a few of my friends specialty cocktails, I will definitely try a martini next time. Also, the decor and atmosphere is extremely stylish and chic. It's a nice little escape from the sometimes ho-hum Champaign-Urbana atmosphere. It would be amazing for a girls night out.",

Intimate booths up front for a date night and plush couches in the back for larger groups - I'm a fan of both. Drinks are priced relatively high for Champaign-Urbana standards at around $7-10 a cocktail, but they are made strong and well so it's worth it in my opinion. Food there is alright - I'm trying hard to remember it but failing ... which means it must not have been that spectacular.Summary: Go to Boltini if you want to get away and relax in an intimate setting. Not if you wanna get wasted and start dancing on the tables. Go to Joe's or Murphy's for that.",

I love the variety of martinis here, which you don't see often at this level, and I especially love the dirty martinis (the Bloody Hot and Dirty).  Appetizers are fantastic to share, especially the pub pretzel fondue and \"Euro Crostini.\"  This all leads me to the only reason I knocked this place down to four stars: My girlfriend got the pub pretzel fondue for me as takeout one day, and the dip was just dumped into the cardboard container with the pretzel, where it inevitably began to seep through.  Why a place that is usually as top-notch as Boltini would just dump a sauce into a cardboard container, I don't know.",

My brother is newly 21, so why not go somewhere with an amazing looking drink menu as well as an amazing looking menu?We got there relatively early on a Saturday, roughly 645pm. There were only a few individuals when we got there. We started the night with drinks, continued the night with drinks, and ended the night with drinks. Oh, and maybe some food. We each had martinis to start and were fairly pleased. Then I stumbled upon this gem of a mojito - strawberry basil. There were no mint mojitos due to the seasonality of mint - I love when restaurants acknowledge this fact. However, strawberries are in season, and made the most delicious drink. Maybe this is why I had 3.Oh, yeah, there's food. Do yourself a favor and order a cheese plate. A lot of the cheeses are from local farms and DELICIOUS. I continued the cheese parade with the Mac and Cheese. Cheddar and strong blue cheese? YUM. By the time we left (about 9:45pm - we take our time!) this place was PACKED, and much louder.Maybe since I'm used to paying Chicago prices for drinks, I found this place to be very reasonable. My mojitos were $8. We spent $95 on drinks, $50 on food, and were stuffed and well \"hydrated\" and very pleased.  Very pleasant service, although as Boltini got busier, we saw our waitress less (she was also doubling as a bartender). I will be back, Boltini.",

Boltini is pretty much the bar you go to when you \"graduate\" from C Street so I'm always bound to run into someone I know.  Sitting outside isn't as amusing as it used to be when \"Three Dollar Margaret\" used to roam Neil Street hitting people up for money, but it's still fun to watch everyone thinking Downtown Champaign is Chicago....it's not.

My boyfriend and I drove down to visit his son that attends UIUC. After having a horrible dinner we decided to stop at this place. The only reason we stopped here was because it looked cozy from the outside and it was right next to our hotel. Now I liked the decor and the people that were in there were just \"ok\". This is were this place screwed up and pissed me off !!!!!!!!1. We sat at the bar and it was a pretty slow night. WE WERE IGNORED BY THE RUDE A$$ BARTENDER!2. I had to catch an attitude to get his attention and after that he was still a d&#%!3. He SNATCHED my credit card out of my hand to open a tab - NO! DONT EVER SNATCH ANYTHING THATS MINE OUT OF MY HAND4. He was pissed because I requested Titos vodka in my Cosmopolitan - how do I know? He looked at me, rolled his eyes, threw cup the old vodka was in, looked at me again, said something bitchy under his breath, aggressively grabbed the Titos bottle and then charged me for drinking a Cosmopolitan that tasted like baby juice. 5.  HIS NAME IS VERY INSIGNIFICANT AND IRRELEVANT BUT HE WAS WORKING (Saturday, March 8th at 9:30 pm)I can't believe the nasty attitudes and horrible customer service I have received in this place. I wasn't asking to have my ass kissed; all I wanted was a drink and enjoy my time. What really surprised me was that another PAYING client wanted to order a drink and he had to literally get nasty with the staff and bartenders to get anyone's attention. I thought I was nasty and bitchy but clearly this is what they do at this bar. Every single person that was behind this bar on March 8th, needs to be severely disciplined. You work in the service industry and should never act towards your clients the way they've acted this night. I will never ever come back to this place and I will tell everyone!",

The servers are as good or better than any other bar in CU that comes to mind (and, for better or worse, I drink nearly everywhere).The place where Boltini really stands apart (for me) are their martinis and mixed drinks. If you order a dirty martini, for example, but specify that you want it only a little dirty they'll get it just right. Their Old Fashioned is quite a production. I forget what all Robb (mgr) put in it, but it was delightful. My absolute favorite mixed drink at Boltini is their Sugar Plum. It sounds pretty froofy, and it is indeed delightfully delish, but this straight arrow stands behind this very strong and very purple (tasting) beverage. I am not sure if the fact that I order mine without sugar on the rim of the glass makes my Sugar Plum swilling any less emasculating, but I do want that fact noted for the record.Lastly, Boltini's hosts 'Tuesday Night Trivia', starting every Tuesday night at 7pm. It is a lot of fun and all you have to do is come with a friend or two or 4 (I think 5 is the max, but it may be 6) and let them know your team name. At this trivia night, as opposed to Canopy Club's, which takes place at the exact same time, team names are punny, but not perverse. The host(s) pass out answer sheets for you to fill in and ask several rounds of questions over the PA. Dont be afraid to ask questions if you are curious. Competition is fun, and the whole thing lasts about 2-2.5 hours. Winners get prizes, including free drinks, appetizers, and even massages. The crowd is good: think professionals, teachers, librarians, grad students and profs. I don't go regularly anymore because it is just a 'lil too dear and also a 'lil to slow. Canopy Club's questions come faster. NTN trivia at BW3's is faster still.Park behind Boltini's in the lot.",

We sat down at one of the small tables and it was much smaller than we thought so I asked her if she had a bigger table...she pointed to her left and looked that way pretty much saying \"that way\"...okay fine...our entire service she seemed really standoffish and not willing to get into the service. We asked her questions about a certain dish, she just stared at us as though we should know what it was and said \"its just 6 pieces on there\"....Then everything came out nice that we ordered, except my friends tapas dish. It wasnt even hot at all. So he told the waitress that he no longer wanted it and if he could order something else (this is when the attitude sparked ALL the way up). She began to question him as to why he didnt like it, and what he didnt like about it and this and that. After he stated that it was cold (for the 10th time) she said we can reheat it in the oven but he cannot have anything else. I got the manager. (Come on now, Ive been to OLIVE GARDEN, and had better service...they are always willing to switch something out if its cold or you do not like it, even though the reason he didnt want it was because it came out cold and unappetizing)When I got the manager she was really nice to me at the bar, but before she could get back to our table, our waitress talked to her. Which resulted in the manager now having an attitude with us. Mind you, it was 5 of us so they can all attest to this and will NOT be returning either, and we have told all of our friends as well. Why the manager was arguing with us, I WILL NEVER KNOW. very long story short, good drinks, terrible service, and even worse management. Honestly, servers can act that way, hey you never know who is having a bad night,  but management SHOULD NEVER EVER act that way.",

The food's only okay (I liked the chicken quesadila but not a lot), but it's pretty cheap and, honestly, you don't come to Boltini for the food. You come for the cocktails. The martinis are great, and if you don't like vodka martinis, there are plenty of great drinks on the menu (personally, I get dirty martinis and Old Fashioned when I don't want to drink sugary stuff). The bar is gorgeous, and they almost always have some sort of music, whether it's a live DJ or a guy and a keyboard (okay, that's not always the best sort of thing). The specials are also fantastic; Wednesdays feature half-price cocktails, and Thursdays feature half price martinis. While I wish they'd tell me what qualifies as a \"martini,\" I'm not going to complain. $15 can get you three really good drinks and a very strong buzz.",

I have never been as insulted by a waiter in my life as I was last night, when our waiter threw our checks at us and then went to the trouble of getting cash out of the register to RETURN OUR TIP, also throwing it at us, even though we paid with credit card.  Not only was this guy completely out of line, when I began reciting this story to friends later in the night \"We almost got in a fight with our waiter...\" everyone I told it to knew which waiter I was talking about from previous experience.  I won't be going back to Boltini for a while, and it gets demoted to 2 stars.  That kind of treatment is unacceptable.I think Boltini is my favorite bar in CU since it is essentially the only one that does not pander to Illini sports and skeezy undergrad men trying to get 18 year old sorority girls drunk, but it's hard to get my friends to go there because they think this makes it \"pretentious\" and \"snobby,\" preferring to get barfed upon at Mike and Molly's or wherever.  Personally I do not think it is pretentious, and I tend to think that the staff are only snobby when the patrons are acting like they are at a kegger and not like normal human beings trying to enjoy a non-Keystone Beverage.  Notably, when I first visited Boltini on a grad school visit whileI was living in Boston, I was SHOCKED at how cheap the drinks were.  I did not expect such low prices from such a well-appointed bar.I would EXPECT Boltini to have the best cocktails of any place downtown but I think that award , bizzarely, goes instead to Guido's.  The other factor contributing to the four star rating is the terrible, omnipresent, cigar-doused in ammonia smell that is even detectable out on the patio.  Perhaps this will improve when Champaign becomes smoke-free.",

Imagine that students and faculty remember their snooty martini bars from back home.  Now imagine them building it in aforementioned farm town.Congratulations, you've found boltini, which shouldn't be as awesome as it is.While Boltini might not pass muster in San Francisco or L.A., it's amazing here, and the staff are friendly, accomodating, and the mood is light.  Spinning music, low lighting, amazing martinis, fantastic cheese platters--yeah, Boltini is a good life choice. I've enjoyed all my boltini visits, and marveled at the joys of pretentiously sippin' strong drinks in triangular glasses while glancing all about me.  Nicely done, Boltini.",

It was really good and really strong!  One is all you need.  We also ordered the margherita pizza, artichoke dip & the fancy mac & cheese.  The pizza was good, the dip was fabulous and the mac & cheese was gross. I do not know why they called it fancy mac & cheese.  The noodles were too big and chewy and the cheese did not have any flavor.  It was bland and boring and sticky.  Nothing fancy about it all so that was misleading.The dip had some hotness to it and had good flavor and consistency.  None of the food came out hot.  The pizza cheese was luke warm at best so I think it was sitting in the kitchen waiting to be brought out for a while.Our waitress was really nice and very helpful with helping us select menu items.Would I go back?  Yes, I would go back and try something different and hopefully we could sit somewhere towards the front and the light of day.  This place is really dark.",

Think black leather semi-circle booths with high backs in the middle of the room. Towards the back of the room are black leather rectangular IKEA couches with glass tables and candlelight everywhere.The drinks are large, mixed well, strong, and tasty. Personally, I prefer a perfect (half dry, half sweet vermouth) gin martini, shaken.You CANNOT go wrong with the cheese plates here. Make sure to come at least in a group of four so you can order the 3 cheese plate. You choose from a cheese list and it is brought out with sliced baguettes (toasted and non-toasted), fruit (green apple slices, grapes), and olives. I would highly recommend the gueyere, euro cream, and the cheese infused with port wine. But seriously, pick and choose to your hearts content because the pairing of great cheese with great drinks will make you feel reallll sexy.I exposed my friends for the first time to Boltinis last weekend and they were highly impressed with the classy setting, quick servers, and amazing cheese and drinks. Even on a hectic Saturday night, we found a nice seating area in the back of the pit for all 8 of us.Boltini Lounge is a place that should stay hidden (thank God it's in dtown Champaign and not on campus) for its adventurous, sick-of-underage-teenybopper-gangsta-wannabes, discriminating clientele. I tell my friends that Boltini Lounge is where the people sick of the same scene at Joe's, Fubar, or even SoMa turn to.We will be there again tomorrow night for a birthday :)EDIT:Only downside is that they don't serve wine... So unfortunately you can't bring your own bottle of nice wine to enjoy here. But I guess you're supposed to be here for the martinis right?",

I had the lobster bisque, which was a special, and it was a nice price (I think $5 for a nicely sized bowl). The drinks will kick your ass... in a good way. Our waiter was SO FUN. Only downside is that we were checked on a little too often, and weren't really given enough privacy to chow down.",

If you like laid back beer-bars like Esquire or Mike and Molly's, you'll be confronted with something entirely different at Boltini. If you're interested in paying a bit more for girly, froo-froo cocktails, food that looks like food only smaller, or an entirely different experience this is the place for you. My most memorable moment at Boltini: asking for a Blue Moon and being handed a bottle (it's on draft everywhere else), and nearly spitting it out when I was told it would cost $4.75! (UPDATE: Blue Moon's are $4.25, not $4.75). They also assigned a single waitress to a group of over 20. When the clearly over-worked waitress couldn't keep up with the groups demands for drinks, I went to bar, and was rudely told by the snobby bartender woman that she couldn't add my beer to my tab because I had started the tab with the waitress. Again, I feel this would be an easy request for any other downtown pub to fill; but Boltini staff are too good to add one number to another number. That being said, if you're interested in fancy cocktails and fancy food--and are willing to pay extra for it--you'll probably like this place. If you're not a cocktail drinker, then skip this place.UPDATE: Thanks to Robb for responding to my concerns. Like I said, it's not my taste, but many people seem to like it. I'd rather have a diverse downtown than have everything the same.",

However, before the music gets turned way up and it gets packed with college students, the inside has a really great ambiance.I've only tasted a few small bites on the menu, but they seem to have a really great offering, including desserts.

My favorite is the Market Monday prix fixe menu with ingredients selected from the saturday farmers market.  to go from fresh local ingredients on saturday morning to a full 5 course meal and wine pairings by monday night is pretty spectacular.  The last couple market night meals that i have been to have been around 40 dollars, and for an additional 25, you can get some awesome wines (highly recommended). The courses are so elegantly prepared with amazing presentation and you won't go home hungry.  I've noticed the dishes are a little too salty for my taste... actually, they're consistently salty to me (but then again this is coming from someone who barely ever salts their food) but i think you can get around it by indulging less in the amazing sauces.  and the desserts-- so delicious.  the desserts truly capture the seasons and the feel of the weather so perfectly.  I honestly don't know a better way to start the week!  if you have a bad case of the mondays, treat yourself to some bacaro.  and your spirits will be lifted. I have gone several times and enjoyed several of the menu items, and a few market nights (i hear they're introducing an occasional VEGETARIAN!!!! market menu!!) and i have never been disappointed.  The service is great, and they are very attentive.  Some servers are more knowledgeable about the wines and others know a little more about the food and preparation, but overall, they are a pleasant and fun to talk to group.  If you ask them a question and they don't know the answer, they are probably equally curious to know the answer as well-- meaning they will find you an answer even if it means hounding the chef :-) I think you definitely get what you pay for.  and for a city like champaign, bacaro is definitely a lovely gem.",

Great atmosphere, dimly lit, very nice.Service: 5 stars... we found the service to be extremely high caliber without being snooty.  We ate at NOMI in Chicago a few weeks ago and the service was comparable.  Quality and Kind... just the kind of service we adore.Food: PERFECT.  I'm not a \"foody\" but I adore good food.  The octopus was the best I've ever had.  The gnocchi was incredibly savory.  My husband tried the steak and I had the lamb special.  Both were FANTASTIC.  Wine suggestion: 4.5 Stars.  Wine was good, not great.  I'm not sure if we failed to describe what we wanted.  Would be nice to have some descriptions in the wine menu.  We've been to several nice restaurants in Chicago that provided descriptions of at least a subset of wine choices.  This is such a minor point though.We did not eat dessert as we were stuffed.I can't say enough good things about this very very special restaurant.  I'm just disappointed we took so long to finally get around to eating there.  We will be back... this is now my favorite restaurant in Champaign Urbana!!",

This was actually my second time here and it was such a nice evening in Champaign, that our party of 4 asked to sit outside even though our original reservation was for the inside and the staff was very accommodating.The wine is half price on Sundays so I had 3 glasses. The Pinot Noir was delightful and the Cab Sauv was decent as well.With wine, we had a cheese plate with 5 cheeses and plenty of bread.For dinner, the risotto with rabbit was tasty.Dessert was a red velvet ice cream cake.  It was okay.  Bacaro used to have a panna cotta that was memorable to the point where, it was the one item I truly wanted to have again when returning to this spot.  Oh well, maybe next time.Overall, a great spot for good food and drink.",

The soup was merely OK and the spaghetti completely underwhelming (bland, in a runny sauce) and a huge disappointment.  I also felt that I was missing a spoon to easier roll the spaghetti in, and I don't really see the point of being given a knife instead.  Finally the Malbec I ordered (by the glass) simply shouldn't be on the menu in a fine dining restaurant.To complete my negative experience, everything on the menu was 2 to 4 dollars more expensive than the already high prices posted on their \"sample menu\" online.   To be fair, the service was fine (although not extraordinary) but obviously couldn't compensate for the rest.",

Don't get me wrong, I love bacon, but not when it doesn't have bacon in it and isn't supposed to taste like that at all..I definitely wouldn't go back here, but it was an interesting experience.",

Not enough to send it back but one more grain of salt and I would have refused to eat it.  My companion suffered the same fate.  The wine list was either very expensive, they did not have it or Slovenian, not sure what's up with that.  We ended up drinking beer because we could not find anything we liked.  I'd give the place one more try just to see if perhaps this was an off night.To the other raves comparing this place to the top restaurants in NY or Chicago I would say \"oh please\"!  It was good, showed promise of things possibly greater but comparing it to a dozen places I could name off the top of my head in either city Bacaro was good but at these prices it should have been better.",

Wine came out about 10 min after our food on a few courses which left us unable to experience the \"pairing\" as you should. We politely and discreetly asked her to bring wine out with or right before food and I think that ticked her off. After that, she was aloof, barely explained the wine or the dishes we were being served. Water was slow to be refilled. The real kicker was the 20% automatic gratuity she added after tax on our bill! When we asked to speak to the manager, she told us \" he's busy dining with a client\". Say what??? I believe your customers are your priority! We asked a different waiter to see if he could find the manager and low and behold, out he came!  Tainted our experience and maybe our waitress was just having a bad day but when you are dropping that kind of money on dinner- you had better train your wait staff on how to properly serve and deal with customers.  It was a shame because from the chef end- he did a great job of making delicious and interesting food- it's just too bad no one explained it well or delivered it professionally.Just wanted to post an update. We received a very kind letter from owner/ manager apologizing for our experience and gave us a generous gift certificate to try them again.  We definitely will give them another chance. Again- the food is amazing and we want to see them succeed.",

I've been to Italy, and this ISN'T Italian...I suppose the entire visit was lackluster. The decor had a lot to be desired, but the wait staff were great. However, once we ordered wine (and, by the old menu at least, were supposed to receive the standard 4oz glass) things went downhill. While we were savoring the tiny portion in our glasses, the bartender was doing his best to overfill the glasses of the pretty girls at the bar. When questioned, we were told \"they asked for doubles.\" Who orders a double Merlot? We chose what appeared to be a special at the time: a smoked duck panini. What arrived at the table was a glorified ham and cheese sandwich. No, I'm not complaining about the sandwich itself, but they had substituted ham instead of smoked duck, then claimed that I wouldn't know the difference. I'm not sure if it was just this visit or the one that followed that biased me, but I'll never return.",

Each dish was seasonal and had a great blend of flavors; I couldn't pick a dish that I didn't like.  We opted for the wine pairing and each wine matched the dish it was served with very well.  Wine has been a hobby of mine for a number of years but my wife is just getting into it, and she was blown away by the taste difference the pairings made.  I think the reviews stating that this restaurant was 'snooty' or that the service was slow are from people who don't truly understand what this restaurant is.  We spent 2 hours eating our 5 course meal.  It's a place where dining is an experience.  Come here expecting that, and come hungry.  Any complaints about small portion sizes must be coming from people ordering a la carte.  We'll be back the next time we want to have a fancy date night, without question.",

If you put the restaurant together as a whole package including the ambiance, the uniqueness of the food, and culinary innovation you would get a 3 star restaurant, however the flip side is that the culinary flavors do not resemble anything like the gastronomic experience you get when you dine at Next in Chicago or Charlie Trotters when it was still open. You pay quite a premium for the dish that are notably small. Our dinner meeting was held at this location. There is plenty of meter parking, just remember to not go over or you will likely be ticketed. I started my meal with the wagyu beef stew which had smoked potato and a bone marrow crostini. I can honestly say the crostini was amazing with bone marrow that offered an amazing umami flavoring, however the actual stew was salty, the beef was not tender by any means sort of tasting like a dinty moore stew. This cost 13 dollars and the portion size was very small. My main entree for 33 dollars was the grilled lobster tail with kale, crispy black truffle polenta, and additional lobster claw and pieces of lobster on the side with a acidic lemon tasting sauce. Once again the portion size was quite small as you see from my picture. I don't believe you get the whole lobster tail as it looked like 1/2 of a lobster tail. There was a piece of claw meat on the side and the other side was shredded lobster meat. The lobster was cooked well, tender and well flavored with the black truffle polenta balancing the seafood, however the attempt at the different texture from the arugula/kale along with the soft polenta and the lobster did not work. Our meal ended with a flourless chocolate cake with blood orange champagne foam and pomegranate jelly. The grapefruit foam hit the spot, but again the cake was a sliver and for that cost you would think the portion would be bigger. Due to the long wait for the waiter to bring the dessert menu, I ended up getting my first parking ticket in Champaign. So I agree the flavors and small portion size at this price do not make this a place that I will frequent. As another yelper said, if you want to impress your date this maybe an interesting place to try, however I am going to try to find another culinary gem elsewhere.Pros: local sustained food, changing menuCons: VERY expensive, small portion size- I left hungry, taste and texture just does not work for some dishesHidden deals:If you really want to impress your date, try the 7 course tasting menu at 85 dollars. I don' t know if that is a deal but at least you get to try everything for $$$",

Since then I move to Stockholm and then New York City. I was back in the area for a few days and decided to try Bacaro again. It was really very good. Yes, despite the fact that there is a lot of mediocre food in the area, it's not the area's fault. Champaign-Urbana has fantastic terroir. There are many producers nearby making food that is world-class and Bacaro uses these ingredients to great effect. I LOVED the goat cheese salad and my rich creamy risotto. Fried sweetbreads were luscious. My boyfriend's chicken with chicken liver was delicious. I guess the only complaint is that the prices here are the same as in NYC...",

The servers are among the most professional in the C-U area. The food is genuinely sophisticated. However Bacaro's commitment to local, seasonal ingredients, while being one of its strengths, is also one of its greatest weaknesses. The menu at Bacaro is constantly changing based on what ingredients they stock. This tends to result in inconsistent dishes whose preparations are constantly changing. Of three visits I've eaten some bad, ok and great meals.Visit 1:Had halibut with some kind of crust in a mint-gazpacho. The fish was fresh and of excellent quality. This was frustrating however because the fish was coated in a greasy crust that became soggy from the fish sitting in the mint gazpacho. The gazpacho was also greasy and was not pleasantly minty. What could have been a complex, herbaceous broth, wound up tasting like greasy mouthwash. Fantastic ingredients but badly executed prep.Visit 2:Valentine's Day prix-fixe. Three courses all of which were delicious. The appetizer was some kind mediterranean type salad if I recall with olives and I think preserved lemon. Delicious and fresh! My main was halibut again, with some kind of vanilla saffron sauce. The fish was perfectly cooked and the sauce was complex and homey. My girlfriend got the steak and it was of great quality with a strong preparation to match. The dessert was a chocolate torte with blood orange sorbet- good flavors that were well-executed.Visit 3:Pork loin with mustard spaetzle. The spaetzle were delicious! I could eat that spaetzle every day. The pork however was DRY. Really, really dry. I was trying to conserve the mustard sauce on the plate in order to make sure there was enough to get on each slice of pork. It was that dry. So in closing out of three, expensive visits, the food has been good maybe 1.5 times- with me being able to say I enjoyed one complete meal (valentine's day) and the side of one of my mains (the spaetzle). If the food was consistent, Bacaro would be an easy 5-stars. Hopefully they can strike a balance moving forward between rotating fresh, seasonal ingredients and maintaining a consistently-executed menu.",

Well, Bacaro certainly deserves it: I finally went there for dinner last night (after wanting to go for several months), and I was wowed. I'm still salivating thinking about it.I went there with pretty high expectations (I'd heard great things about it from several friends and coworkers): that's usually not a good thing as it makes it easier to be disappointed, but Bacaro did not disappoint. In fact, I'm happy to say that my dinner there was on a par with my best dining experiences in NYC.First and foremost: the food. My boyfriend and I decided to share a bunch of dishes. For appetizers, we ordered the fresh mozzarella with heirloom tomatoes and pesto, as well as the roasted suckling pig with homemade sauerkraut: they were both absolutely delicious (don't miss the suckling pig!). We then shared one entree: we got the braised pork shank, which came with sauteed spinach, mushrooms, bacon, and fig sauce: soooo good! The portions are not huge, but two appetizers and one entree turned out to be enough food. For dessert, we got the panna cotta with fresh fruit: simple but just as outstanding. That was some seriously great food!!As Bacaro is also a wine lounge, their wine selection is quite extensive. We got a sampler of three wines by the glass for $14, all of which were pretty good. Not to forget the 10yo port we got with our dessert (very generous pour...), which was good also.Service was great, ambiance was great (although it's a shame that the place was so empty)... it was really a great dinner (sure, it was not cheap, but entirely worth it!). By far the restaurant in Champaign, in my opinion. I'll definitely be back.",

On our most recent visit, we ordered a few things from the new menu, all of which seemed fantastic--it was hard to choose. We had greens, octopus salad, gnocchi, and the scallop entree. Each course was just as delicious as the last. The scallop entree is so clever and very well executed--it's such a treat to have perfectly cooked, high quality seafood in the middle of Illinois. Chef Drew worked his magic with this dish. There are \"scallop potatoes\" on the plate, which blend in and look just like the actual scallop next to it. Biting into the potato is an experience, especially if you're expecting a scallop! They are divine. I could eat a whole plate of just the potatoes, I swear.We were too full to order dessert, but everything I've had in the past from the dessert menu has been phenomenal--creative, elegant and fun at the same time. Their pastry chef Lindsey is awesome! As for wine, I didn't have anything beyond Prosecco on my last visit, but I usually just allow the staff to select something for me. It's always on the money.The service is always impeccable as well--smooth, engaging when it needs to be and with a huge attention to detail. Connor took care of us on our most recent visit. He's a truce service professional--knowledgable, eager to offer suggestions and advice with the menu, but allows the experience to flow naturally. We had such a nice time with him! Plus, Julie is always there to make sure everyone is having a perfect experience.I highly recommend bacaro to anyone who is visiting CU who is looking for a polished, smooth, fine-dining experience. I would also steer visitors that way if they are just looking for a place to relax with a glass of wine. And for those of you who live in this community and have yet to try bacaro, I would say do yourself a favor and go! Treat yourself!",

We chose to do the tasting menu which was about 6 courses, complete with a cheese course and dessert.  I paired it with the wines too. The wine list was definitely impressive.  Lots of interesting wines at very fair prices. They are considered a wine bar, so I was hoping for a good list.  But I was impressed with the prices, there were many bottles on the list for under $30 which is always great to me.  It's easy to fill a list with great expensive bottles, but it is indeed very difficult to pick a variety of great wines at reasonable prices. The wines paired perfectly with each dish, I was so happy.  About the food... I was just so impressed.  The octopus over german potato salad was unlike anything I've ever had, and just so delicious.  Yes, it does sound strange but it was so well done, and the octopus was cooked just perfectly, it was so tender.  I was so thrilled the chef has decided to include this as one of the courses.  We had a big scallop seared and served over corn salsa which was almost sweet but just delicious.  We also had braised rabbit, which again was tender and also quite flavorful sitting in a pool of broth, with some tomatoes, and homemade pasta.  The rib eye for the main course was flavorful and again very tender.  The cheese course was fun.  And I loved thin very rich slice of chocolate dessert.  To be honest, I was simply amazed at the quality of these dishes.  Sure it is a more expensive dinner out, but for the quality and caliber of the dishes, it is a steal!! This is easily one of my most memorable and favorite dining experiences.  Easily 5 stars for Bacaro!!",

There were seven courses on the tasting menu, including a dessert. They were small portions, but I was almost full by course 5, and completely full at the end, so there was plenty of food. It was pretty expensive, but we knew what we were getting into, so the over $300 bill didn't surprise us. The atmosphere was great. I was surprised to find this gem in CU.",

Staff were excellent - greeted us with free Prosecco, lots of happy anniversaries, and so on.  Staff are incredible, professional, courteous, knowledgeable, patient, responsive, and kind.  Really kudos there. Portions are small - you probably would expect that in this sort of establishment. We opted for a la carte options.  I don't mind paying top dollar for great food, but the total for two people prix fixe with wine substitution is $240 before tip.  Now again, I don't mind paying, but there are michelin starred restaurants in fabulous cities that are not -this- expensive.  This is Champaign, a small but charming place in central Illinois.  Wife and I had a bottle of wine, two pasta entrees, and two desserts to the tune of about $110 after a nice tip (20-25%) - You can eat reasonably here if you avoid the prix fixe menu. The food was great.  Everything was jam packed with flavor, perfectly cooked, and elegantly presented. Would definitely return for another 'date night' or special occasion.  Definitely not a place to go for dinner if you're looking for grub, though.",

Both meals were very good, but on the small side for $17 each.

There was presentation to the entire experience, which is something I've found a little lacking since moving to Champaign.I wouldn't want to eat in the bar area on a Saturday night, and if the hostess hadn't been able to move us into the other room we would have had to leave.  My dad can't hear very well and his hearing is better than my lip reading.  The bar area is really nice and I'd love to eat there on a Tuesday, which I have.The good:  The food.  Three people, three different dishes, and everybody liked theirs.  I had the halibut and mom had the rabbit, and if you're going in there soon, I'd recommend either, and even more I'd recommend the vichyssoise with crab and asparagus.  If you're hardline vegetarian (I eat fish) then you'll have problems with the menu, but I believe the waitress at least implied that the chef would make allowances/prepare something else?  Either way you should call ahead and see.  I have no complaints about oversalting like other reviewers, perhaps they listened?  The malbec we drank with dinner was a nice random choice.The bad:  Our waitress was new.  At least I hope she was new.  The service was great but she wasn't as familiar with the menu or wine list as someone working at that caliber of restaurant should be.The manhattans were terrible.  I suspect Bacaro of being yet another restaurant who thinks they should have their own special manhattan, with exotic bitters and cherry juice and... do you think you're going to save me from scurvy or something?  I want bourbon, bitters, and sweet vermouth, and go easy on everything but the bourbon.  This is no time for creativity.The dessert menu is stupid.  Who follows octopus and rabbit with banana bread and ice cream?  Hire a dessert chef.I would totally recommend Bacaro if you need \"fancy dinner out.\" Sometimes I do.  Sometimes I have parents who need impressing.",

On the whole, the food was very good, but the overall experience fell short of my expectations for other dinners of similar quality that I have had elsewhere.   First, the atmosphere of the restaurant, while nice, did not strike me as anything special.  That said, this could be a product of where I sat.   Even though I placed a reservation close to a week in advance, I found myself sitting at the table nearest to the kitchen with my date.  While she had a view of downtown Champaign and the restaurant's interior, my own view was of a row of temperature controlled wine racks and a junky-looking electrical socket near the kitchen's entrance.     For the appetizer, we had the pizzetta, which didn't strike me as anything special:  just bread, cheese, grape tomatoes, onion, and bacon.   Our entrees-- the braised rabbit and the grouper-- were better, but as others have mentioned, the portions were quite small, even for a restaurant focused on contemporary fine-dining.  Thanks to a bottle of wine and a second helping of bread, nobody left hungry, but with the final bill clocking in at close to $120, it was hard not to walk away with a sense that some of that money could be better spent elsewhere.         Ultimately, in giving Bacaro three stars, I am rating it in the context of other \"fine-dining\" establishments.  The restaurant's chefs clearly know how to cook, and their wait staff is very well trained, but I don't think that either the food nor the space warrants the price that they have set on it.",

I always preferred Radio Maria, Escobar or some other place for a nice meal. So before we set out on a Friday night for Bacaro, I decided to Yelp it and I was (and still am) very suspicious of a few of the reviews.  Here was a place with lots of 1 & 2 star reviews and yet a couple of 5 star reviews, written in great length and gushing detail by Yelpers for whom this was their only review.  So who writes their first and only review in great length and never mentions anything they ordered, just summarizing it as an excellent restaurant, then never subsequently reviews any other restaurant?  I may be a cynic, but it raises red flags....So, we set off to do our own independent research:  Three people on a Friday night.  The place is full, we get one of a couple of available tables, with no reservations.  The waitress was wonderful.  My first requirement to enjoy a restaurant experience is good service, and she was great.  She knew the menu, she was unequivocal when we asked her what she liked.  She kept her distance and watched us for cues, never interrupting a conversation and never rushing us nor ever making us wait.The wine list is huge, the drink list is equally huge, but both are very pricey by Champaign standards. My wife's martini was a very full glass, all the way up to the \"c\" section as we Assembly Hall fans would say.We had a risotto special with fish \"for the table\", one mixed green salad, and one fried pork belly starter.  The pork belly was $10 and was the size of a large marshmallow in the center of a 12 inch plate, humorous by its dinkyness. But good, like a chunk of fried bacon fat.Then we had three entrees, all were very good.  Mine was the grouper ($28) and frankly I don't recall my companion's meals because we also knocked down one martini and two bottles of Cote D' Rhone between the three of us.  The Cote D' Rhone was $28/bottle and the lowest price wine on the list.  Several other wines could be had in the high $30's, and then the rest of the list was north of $40.One apple pie ala mode later and the three of us were out of there for $192 before tip; and she was worth the $40 tip we left, so by the end of the day it approached $77 per person.So if you start a Yelp review at a three, this place gets one more star for having a great server, one star for being in DT Champaign and being beautiful inside & out, including cloth hand towels in the loo.  Then I'll knock one star off for being too pricey for the market, but if Yelp allowed half-stars I'd give Bacaro 4.5.",

Both were cooked very nicely and the unique ingredients made the meals slightly different, but for the prices they charge the taste of each was really just average. My steak wasn't very tender or all that flavorful. Her chicken was cooked decently enough but again the flavor was really just average. I thought maybe because we were there on the Sunday before Labor Day, that maybe it was an off night. But I just couldn't get past the fact that when a place must such a high price on their menu, there really shouldn't be such a thing as an \"Off Night\". The atmosphere and the waiter we had were very nice. So here is my take. Wait staff 3-4 starsAtmosphere 4-5 starsWine list 4-5 StarsBeer list 3-4 starsMenu 4-5 stars Food 2-3 stars I probably wouldn't go here again just because its priced to high to take a chance on a very average meal. There are a lot of places near by that you get exactly hat you pay for. Unfortunately Bacaro is not one of those places.",

I think this place's most inventive time was its best time, about 3 years ago, maybe a little more.  Food items are less adventurous and price point has increased with time.  That said, the desserts under their pastry chef of the last year or two have been TOPS.  Service I have always found to be very good and knowledgeable, esp. about wine.  I am curious to see how the metamorphosis of the former Persimmon Grocery into a mozzarella bar (is CU ready?)/wine lounge/private dining salon will go.",

I think if I had even just ordered the linguini that was our 3rd course I still would have been full.This is definitely a special occasion kind of restaurant, but I will certainly go back if I ever have a special enough occasion again.",

The beef tenderloin was charred nicely on the exterior and was cooked to a perfect pink.  The seared scallops with Myers Lemon were refreshing and light.  The gnocci was a showstopper as was the risotto with black truffles and the duck breast.

We ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, and, because I wasn't feeling very adventurous, chose the oven roasted chicken as my entre.  Overall, I found both these dishes a little too salty (maybe the chef was just having an off night?).  The portions are modest, but you would probably expect a little more for the price you're paying.  They did have a decent cheesecake and the check came out with a couple yummy chocolate chip meringues, but overall I guess I was a little disappointed.In consensus with what many others have said, service was very attentive, but I felt it was almost to the point of pretentiousness.  Based on this experience alone, I would most likely not recommend Bacaro's nor dine here again, but I really don't want to dislike this establishment and would like to come back again sometime in the future and give it another chance.

However, the dessert left a lot to be desired, in particular the persimmon and pistachio bread pudding. It was just plain soggy and tasteless. I recommend not ordering dessert here if you do plan on coming. In regards to the waitress and hostess, they were very helpful and courteous, in contrast to many of the other reviewers who saw them as \"snooty\" and pretentious. The atmosphere was pleasant and the ambient music was suitable for the occasion.",

Of course, there were 2 excellent red wines accompanying this meal, recommended by the uber competent hostess Julie and my server Nick. Just when I thought I couldn't eat any thing more fabulous, I had the peanut butter ice cream, which was amazing. I went to Bacaro again tonight (Tuesday April 7) and started with the octopus appetizer, which was startling in a fantastic way in its tomato sauce with shaved chorizo sausage--who knew such flavors could brilliantly mix? I followed this with the strip steak, which exceeded expectations in its deliciousness and perfect serving preparation and size. Although full, I had to finish this outstanding meal with the never-to-disappoint, peanut butter ice cream. It is velvety smooth. As always, my servers, Kyle and Sara were excellent--both knowledgeable and competent. They served an outstanding meal. Bacaro is definitely the place to treat yourself, which never disappoints.",

This particular day was the Ciabatta bread sandwich with fresh mozzarella, real garden tomatoes, pesto, and cucumber salad for side. $12 including a drink. So good!

I am happy to say it has taken back it's rightful spot as both my favorite and simply the best restaurant in town... and one of the my favorite spots anywhere. As I mentioned previously the decor and staff are superb, but Chef Thad Morrow is now to be seen frequently in the dining room, and is doing a much better job of maintaining food standards than than the previous Maitre D'. Food is now flawless, and portion sizes have increased somewhat too, which for most was a welcome change. There is also a new Bar snack menu, which combines comfort-food with nouveau twists, like spicy homemade pork crackling! Bacaro could compete on a world stage, and do very well.",

The pairing was correct and the wine went well with our meals.  It was somewhat amazing also the fact that it wasn't a very expensive wine that was suggested.This is a very good place to eat in the Champaign area.  The reason I gave it 5/5 (instead of 4/5) is because even though the food is a little over priced in my mind, the service, atmosphere, and location lend to it receiving a 5/5.",

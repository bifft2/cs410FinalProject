I don't particularly love the coffee, as it's not really coffee, like Starbucks, but I like the atmosphere, staff and the Korean nostalgia I get when I am inside. The prices are steep but mainly on stuff that is not the coffee, such as the bingsoo or waffles. I would say that Cafe Bene beats out the, close, neighboring competition by a long shot; Caffe Paradiso and Espresso Royale are really no good in the coffee department.",

Perfect place to study or socialize, whichever suits your fancy.It ends there. Their coffee is always a disappointment - the regular blend is too sour. Latte based drinks too heavy on the milk. Espressos are always overdrawn.Im not sure about the safety standards either. I had the waffle with strawberries (overpriced, btw) and the strawberries smelled/tasted fishy. That happens when fruits are old/unclean/beginning to rot, as I learned from my experiences working as a produce handler. Service is not exactly unfriendly, but completely incompetent. They either have to ask your order multiple times or just flat out get it wrong-both the type and quantity of the order.I've also had a time when I've ordered a 'for here' drink (since they asked, \"for here or to go?\") and it was served me in a paper cup. I then went up two more times to get that same drink, and both times they asked \"in a for here or to go cup?\" so I said 'for here' and all three times it was given me in a paper cup. Insulting.",

Misugaru latte tasted like drinking dissolved chalk in water.  Classic Arnold palmer was a very badly conceived balance of tea to lemonade.  Honey bread was 99% standard dry bread.  Though it tasted okay, the dryness from the rest of the bread overtook any toppings added to it.Value.  1/10.  Honey bread is probably something close to a 2000% markup on ingredients.  Cannot go here regularly without breaking the bank.  If the taste and quality and consistency of the drinks was commensurate with the price, then that'd be different since the upcharge would be tied to a higher level of enjoyment from a higher quality product.  But it seems like they are peddling cheap and badly made drinks and food, for outrageous prices.Going once a year is probably a good bet for this place.  Going too often will make you poor, and will leave a bad taste in your mouth (if the food and drink hasn't already), because you feel as though you've paid for a meal and a drink, but have been given a hodgepodge of 10 cent ingredients prettied up to look good.  Great ambience, and customer service only get you so far when the food and drink you serve is inconsistent, outrageously priced, and lackluster at best.",

I just want to say that your message just make me want to throw up, your a retard I hope you will never come back to caffe bene again.\"Did I just receive internet hate? Also, people feel this strongly about this place? The drinks I ordered wanted to make me throw up, which may explain why my review was vomit-inducing. It doesn't take much training to mix in the powder into the liquid. The drinks we got when I was there was half powder floating on top of the ice and milk. I will admit that I haven't been back since I was there last time but since then I haven't heard anything good about the place. Giving it another one star rating in place of a friend who went and was terribly disappointed. Don't expect decent coffee here. Paradiso is just a block away, go there instead.",

When I went to order the guy just stared at me, he didn't say a single word. No \"hello,\" or \"welcome,\"or \"thank you.\" He just looked at me, and idk it felt as if I shouldn't be there. When the next customer went to order he suddenly found his tongue, and was polite. He gave me my drink in silence of course, and I originally planned to relax there for a bit but decided to book it. Thanks but no thanks. I'd rather go to the other coffee shops on campus, where I get more bang for my buck as well as some decent service.",

They're opening a new location on Green Street, so I hope they handle the first weeks better.The interior is really trendy and usually quiet, so it's a nice place to grab a cup of coffee and study. Their green tea frappe is alright. I think it's a bit too icy and Starbucks makes it better. However, the honey bread is fantastic! I got the strawberry honey bread to go and it's absolutely gorgeous how they package their food. The bread is really sweet and thick, drizzled in honey, and on top is an arrangement of strawberries in the form of a flower. I was wondering why it took so long for it to come out, but it's definitely worth the wait! Their gelato is also fantastic and they give you a lot for $2. I recommend getting the green tea or Greek yogurt flavors.They also have meal options and tons of the cutest desserts, so I definitely plan to return and try them!",

The trainee was EXTREMELY polite by the way! When the drink came out it was not what I was expecting, and really gross. We spent $18 at the place, so I went to the counter immediately and explained it wasn't what I was expecting and if possible I'd like to change my order. The trainee apologized and went to ask her supervisor. The supervisor, right in front of me, wouldn't turn around. She told the trainee \"ummm no I don't think we do that\". The trainee apologized. Bad experience. I didn't expect a free drink, even though we spent a lot of money. I at least wanted the supervisor to look at me and explain instead of Laying it on the very nice trainee.I ended up drinking most of the misugaru. I like healthy carb options, and it's not all the bad. The initial taste was weird but it's okay. It's a multi-grain mill drink. The only thing is that when I spend a lot of money at a place, and unfortunately order something I don't enjoy, I hope the supervisor comes out to ask what's wrong...",

After going to Bevier Cafe yesterday with a couple of friends, the good news is that I don't dislike the place.We arrived a few minutes before the cafe closed, and they were out of some of their entrees.  The food we got seemed to have been sitting out for a while, and it wasn't as tasty as I anticipated.  Also, their service seems kind of disorganized--you take a tray, tell the people at the counter what you want, pay for it, go sit down with an empty tray, and then the employees bring you your food.  Couldn't they just hand the food over the counter?  Or just have real servers?  Even with the not-as-good-as-expected food and the confusing service, I like the concept of Bevier Cafe.  I'm happy to support a student/university-run restaurant, and I will eat there again.",

You probably won't love every dish they make, but there's little displays so you have a pretty good idea what you're getting.  The prices have increased a little from what other reviews say, to $5 an entree for lunch and $0.75 for sides.  But I think it is usually worth that.Some things I've had here:Pastrami on marbled rye: was quite tasty.  Maybe not quite as flavorful as the Beef Stand, but cheaper and closer for me.  Fried okra: is the best I've had in town.  Yum.FSHN chips sandwich: I was a little disappointed in this one - there seemed to be less fish than breading.Beer battered cod and chips - was pretty good.Mushroom and turkey panini - also pretty good, and satisfying on a cold  day.Manhattan clam chowder: I liked this a lot, it had a tasty broth and many chunks of fish.  I'll have to try the soups more often.Overall: since there are multiple dishes, it seems like there's usually at least one thing worth trying.  I've never had the salads or desserts, but they look pretty good.  Service has been good every time I went, though obviously this depends a bit on the students working.  I've been pretty happy with the food, I kinda like the cafeteria style set-up, and the price is right.  I'll be coming back here to try out more of the menu.  Great for a day when you forgot your lunch or just need a break and some tasty grub.Since I found it, it has become one of my regular lunch spots.

Some of the menu items sound a little strange, but be daring because these kids know what they're doing! I tried a cold salad with potatoes, apples, bacon, candied walnuts, and chicken... yum. Today I had indian stew with lentils, veggies (carrot, bell pepper, onion), salmon, and tilapia.. super yum!

The Salad was great. And I NEVER like salads. I generally go out of my way to pay extra for an alternative but I noticed that the salad today looked pretty good and I was glad I made that choice. It was chock full of fresh vegetables, juicy chicken, and great taste! The salads here are wayy bigger than the entrees. I was not impressed with the Gumbo.

They also offer portable coffee mugs for $10 with $.50 refills for an eternity after! take that, espresso royale!!  on my graduate student budget, it sure makes me warm and gooey inside to know that i can get real food (and the elixir of life- coffee!) at such an affordable price and in a convenient location.  sure beats my made in 30 seconds pbj for lunch!",

It's a nice cross between a fancy restaurant and a cheap cafeteria.There are always at least a few dishes to pick from, rotating daily.  They also have a house salad and Greek salad every day.  They charge $5 for (practically) every entree, which is sometimes too much, sometimes too little for the dish.  On the other hand, all sides are $0.75, so it all kind of evens out.  They also have rotating desserts, but always have big, soft, fresh cookies.Although going through the line to pay with your tray feels like a cafeteria, the seating is basic, but very nice, wooden, and pretty comfortable.  You sit with a number and relax and wait for your dishes to be brought to you--which usually isn't too long.They do serve breakfast, but I haven't been able to try it yet.  The convenience of being able to check the menu on the website pushes the score to an A+!",

You see, I have a class from 11-12 in Bevier Hall, and the cafe itself is exactly one floor below my classroom.  Did I mention I get out at noon?  When lunch is served?  Yeah, you do the math.It's a damn good thing that B.C. is relatively cheap ($4.50 for a major entree, or sandwich), or I'd be broke and panhandling in front of the place at this rate.  The Food Service students run a fantastic local cafe that helps them get hands on experience and gets me lunch time eatin' on the cheap.  There's always a vegetable side, some mouthwatering dessert, and the space is cheery and pleasant if a bit utilitarian.  Bevier's well worth the visit.  That said, it's basically cafeteria style in that you pick up a tray, select your food options, add on bread, dessert, drinks, etc, then pay for your meal.  They'll give you a number, and a smiling food service student will bring you your food--often eerily promptly.  Now, my only request is that you don't crowd up the place when i come charging in all hungry like.  Cuz that's not cool.But go check out the cafe, with a fantastic array of food orders (and a daily changing menu!), you're bound to be satisfied.",

I came here for the first time yeeears ago on my violin teacher's recommendation (she is a  U of I graduate and had many fond memories of the place). I have been here several times since; I always try to stop by when I'm in the neighborhood. Za's has an excellent location near campus and a lot of other restaurants, apparel shops, ice cream/froyo places, etc. Eating here can be a bit overwhelming at first because there are SO many options! You fill out a sheet of paper to describe exactly what you want with options from salads, paninis, soups, pizzas, smoothies, and more. The big selling point of Za's is that you can customize your order to exactly how you want it with any toppings, sauces, or flavors--any way you want it! After ordering, you scoot on over to the pick-up counter and wait for your food to be ready. There are tables both upstairs and downstairs, so don't fret if every table is taken on the first floor. The stairs are kind of steep, so be careful as you walk up there with your food! I usually order the \"pick two\" option. My favorite is the broccoli cheddar soup with the \"lite panini,\" which can be customized exactly how you want it. The broccoli cheddar here is one of my favorites and has grated cheddar cheese on top. Yum. The food is by no means mind-blowing. Overall, this is your standard Italian lunch food with a few very above average options, like the soup. I also highly recommend trying the smoothies here (my drink of choice is the mango). They use real fruit and fruit juice!Honestly, if you're in the area, you really can't miss a stop at Za's. Note: I last ate here before it burned down, so I can't speak to the quality of the original's replacement.",

Mia Za's is located in a cozy little row of businesses in the heart of Campus Town conveniently adjacent to the University of illinois' main Quad.  Parking can be a bit difficult, but there are usually spaces available a block or two from the location, bring money as Parking Enforcement is serious business in and around Campus.Depending on the time of day you may be hard-pressed to find ample seating for you and your dining companion as this place is very popular with the student population. If there isn't enough room on the main floor you can head upstairs to find more tables, and a warm atmosphere with a very beautiful copper ceiling, and Italian inspired artwork on the walls.Their menu is full of incredibly tasty and healthy ingredients, and everything is cooked to order. It'll probably take longer for you to decide on what to order with the custom Pizza, Pasta, Panini, and Salad options. But never fear for those you that are indecisive; Mia Za's offers more traditional favorites as well.Prices vary on what kind of sauce or items you get, and if you get extra items. With that said you can get a \"Pick 2\" where you get half an order of pasta, salad, or panini served with another half order of salad, soup, or panini for just shy of 7 dollars (without drink).",

Now that I am back I have found out that there are multiple locations which works out well. The prices are actually cheaper than when I was here for college due to a modification in the menu. For the pasta you get to select from multiple types and sauces with 4 toppings for 5 dollars. The premium protein items i.e shrimp, meatballs, chicken will run you a dollar more each. The food is prepared quickly, however I don't know if they changed it now to use a convection oven/microwave to nuke your toppings which is one down side. This is then added to a pan with the sauce and served quickly. You also get a nice piece of garlic bread. All and all this is better than McD and for the same price. There are also other options such as pizza, salads, sandwiches etc. I have never strayed from the pastaPro: inexpensive, quick, large portionsCons: microwaved toppings (i guess you get what you pay for)Hidden gem:Sign up for the perka app. You need to check in and tell the cashier so they can give you the punch to earn free food. I did not realize this and ended up not getting my first check-in. You can't just check-in which makes sense or people would abuse the system",

I went with a group of 3 and 2 of us did not receive what we intended to get because of the crowded environment while filling out the complicated form. The form is straight to the point for the most part but it's layout is terrible. Why can't I just verbally communicate with the cashier like at, you know, any QSR. Super generic food. Very little flavor. It was relatively inexpensive, which is a common theme for a college campus, but so are the other dozen restaurants on the block. You can find any of the entrees at a Potbelly's, Jimmy John's, Noodles, and Antonio's Pizza which is within a 100 yard radius of Mia Za's and all are better options.",

I had to demand an apology and a refund.  AND it didn't come easy.  Every single one of the employees there gave me an attitude, even the owner tried to lecture me on how busy they are.

I came one night during a slow dinner with my bf and it was practically empty. After filling out the forms, we went to wait. Half an hour passed by and three other people who came after me got their food. Another guy took a pizza I thought was mine, but the kitchen guy shrugged and insisted it wasn't. My bf got his pizza after fifteen minutes and began to eat without me while I sat around waiting. I kept asking the kitchen staff who said to be patient and wait even though I was already waiting for half an hour. After finishing my milkshake, I was clearly annoyed and not hungry anymore. I considered demanding a refund when the manager? came up to me and asked me what I was waiting for. I told him a pizza and he went to look for it. He returned and told me they LOST my form somehow in a sea of four sheets of paper. I had to fill out another one and wait even longer. When my pizza came, I decided to eat it but it wasn't even that appetizing. The crust was thin and floppy and it looked like they haphazardly threw on the toppings.  Personally, I'm disappointed with Mia Za.",

The price is great, too.Pretty much everything else on the menu---whether you customize it or not---will also be well prepared, well presented, and well received by your taste buds. Back in sophomore year of high school I had lunch here almost daily, and the only bad experience I can remember involved an unbearably spicy sauce that even my high-spice-tolerating Chinese friends agreed was over the top. (The chef may have just screwed up my particular order that day, but just to be safe, I'd stay away from any spicy option.)On a final note, I've always been surprised at how quickly my order is ready, regardless of how crowded the restaurant is.",

That's an entire meal for $5 and tax. Portions are always large (I usually pick 2: salad and pasta).There is plenty of seating (just head upstairs if you don't like sitting close to people or have more than a party of 2). I love the plastic cups that you can take and bring back for cheeper drinks (think Starbucks or Duckin' Donuts without the expensive coffee) and the service is always friendly. Ordering can be a little confusing the first time (which sheet is for the pasta!?) but someone is happy to help you out and ask all the important questions (artichokes? do you like olives? do you want pasta? do you like cheese?). Overall, this places is fairly inexpensive, friendly, clean, and it's always open, even in those strange summer months when no one is around.",

I definitely found the ordering papers overwhelming the first time I visited a Za's, but I didn't have to wait on my co-worker, who picked out a delicious meal pretty quick.  While we were waiting in line, there was a guy standing next to it checking papers and passing out cups to make sure they were clear before we got to the checkout.  This proved to be genius, because we were through the line in about five minutes.  In another 5-10, we had our food.  And it was good.  My only complaints were that my rotini wasn't exactly al dente and there were lots of onions and garlic in everything (but this is only bad for me personally).The prices vary, but if you get a lunch-sized serving and a drink, you can get out for $7-10.  If it's a little bigger, or you decide you want a slice of their delicious tiramisu, it's gonna be more like $12-15.Quick, (seemingly) fresh, 'licious.",

While looking at the bill of fare at this establishment, the owner came out and gave us a sales pitch for having our dinner there.This is a very small \"hole in the wall\" place that probably seats no more than 20 diners.  Tables are on the first floor and also on a second floor.The gimmick here is that you are provided with a ballot-like menu to order your food.  We both decided to order a pasta meal.  So, we filled out a paper form that allows you to select the type of noodles, sauce, toppings, and other items you want to eat.  Then you hand the form to the counter attendant, and they call you when your meal is ready: usually in less than ten minutes.The same procedure is used to choose salads, paninis, and pizza.We were there at about 5:45 on a Monday during the summer session, so the place was not busy.

But it's good food and cheap Italian if you need a fix. I'm fond of the thin-crust pizza, and I normally get half with a spinach salad. But the menu is so diverse as to be overwhelming. Come prepared to fill out a scantron of deliciousness; it's totally worth it every once in a while, but the vast array of options slow the place down to no end.",

Honestly, it felt like Henry Ford was making a Model T-ortelini.I do like that you can customize salads and sandwiches and pasta--and that lemon cream sauce is DELICIOUS.However, it has all the personality of a computer science grad student, and the old-style Italian movie poster lend very little charm.Yet I know I'm going to be hungry at some point in the middle of the day and forget to bring my lunch.And then Henry Ford's Italian Motor Cafe will be there for me.",

It was wet in the middle and pretty unencumbered by flavor.I tried a smoothie once.  It was aiight.  Never been compelled to try another.I tried a salad once.  It was pretty boring, and it made me miss Pluto's back in Palo Alto.But the tomato basil soup, I love.  It's divine with its small sprinkling of grated parmesan (?) cheese that melts only halfway even though you stir it.  One thing I don't appreciate is the impatient guy who calls out my name.  He was pretty obnoxious this one time when I didn't respond on the first call.  But rudeness and some small confusion about not having a form to just order soup won't keep me away from good soup on Green Street.Under 4 bucks for a bowl of soup that comes with a small piece of french bread is good eatz.  And fast, too.",

Throwing vegetables (and sometimes fruit) in a bowl doesn't constitute a salad, folks. The pizza and pasta are ok though.I am still giving it 3 stars because they have a good selection of iced tea and the extraordinarily eclectic ambiance. There is wall art of unique silhouettes like a cat dangling from a power line and a ninja on a bike upstairs which are modestly entertaining. But there is also a great little function where you can text in a song request and a monitor will play the song and video.My choice?Birthday Song - 2 Chainz ft. Kanye West.3 stars.",

Went here last night before the dinner rush at around 4 pm. It's one of those places where they give you a sheet of paper with predetermined options on it OR the option to create your own pizza, pasta, salad, or sandwich. Most of the people working the counter are just college students and therefore not necessarily skilled in helping you create awesome meals. After staring at the overwhelming menu for a little while I ended up creating my own pizza. I had garlic marinara sauce with a feta/mozzarella mix topped with red onions, olives, and sun dried tomatoes. It was kick-ass! I ate (most) of the whole thing. I did give away some of it because it was too good not to share. I had been to this place a few years ago (before it burnt down and was rebuilt) and I remember having something delicious then, too! I believe I created a pasta that time.I really had minimal interaction with staff, but everyone seemed pleasant when I did need them to place the order. They don't really \"wait\" on you because it's seat yourself, leave your dishes at the table. Really all you're doing is ordering at a counter; kind of like a more fancy, involved, delicious subway concept.",

Seriously, where else would you go?  I've been a fan for years.I have always loved their pastas the best, and they've really expanded the options. Last time I went, I got multigrain rotini with pesto and veggies.  It felt really healthy and light, even though it was a sizable portion.  The huge and delicious piece of garlic bread did kind of counteract the \"light\" feeling, however...  I also had one of their delicious smoothies, and I have never gone wrong by ordering any of their infinite combos.  Anything with mango in it is an automatic favorite of mine!Yeah, it's not gourmet, but for an inexpensive lunch that isn't fast food or a chain place, it's definitely the best you can get in Champaign.

We kept telling them about this issue and all the time they said : yeah you are right, and kept doing the same thing! Today we went there for lunch and we saw the same thing, cashier preparing food with bare dirty hands. When my friend wanted to order, he told the cashier and she just went and took the pizza bread with her hands in front of us! We tried to be calm and waited for our food. And guess what we got! My friend got his pizza with the smallest amount of cheese and toppings in the world! The whole thing was just a big bread! He got angry and asked the staff where their boss is. The old guy there said she is out of town and will be back on Wednesday. Well! And he did not accept that the staff use their bare hands to prepare food and showed us tongs and said they always use this! Well, we have never seen them use the tongs!

This is my first comment, usually I'm too lazy to leave any but not this one! I'm telling u I'll seek for job there, maybe u will see me working there next time you go to A plus!

We avoided this place for a long time because the only genuine reviews here were so negative and we didn't want to accidentally walk into an upscale version of Hooters. We ultimately decided to try it on an impulse while walking by to buy tickets for an upcoming event. Our experience was surprisingly average! Despite the odd claims that the waitresses  are \"super hot\" I was happy to find them to be very average and down to earth. Most importantly, I was happy to see that there were no stripper poles, blacked out windows,  or scantily clad bartenders. We decided that this place would be great to rent or reserve for a celebration or to come for karaoke. Let's be honest, it's Urbana. This place is never going to be a hopping dance club but I could see this place being a super fun karaoke place. They've got a big stage that's just perfect for it.There are definitely a few things to be desired. They're trying really hard to appear high end but the menu consists of low end bar food. The music doesn't fit the ambiance at all. They were playing a mix of classic rock and top 40 when the vibe is more suitable for r&b or jazz. There was also a lingering odor of deep fryer.In the end, we were happy this place wasn't as trashy as it sounded and will probably be back to check on updates and look into reservations for an upcoming special occasion.1/30/15 UPDATE I came here for the magic show and I was chewed out by the owner and security for 'blocking the view' of a man. I guess it was more important that the lazy guy behind me have a completely unincumbered view in his comfortable seat than it was for me, a petite girl and devoted yelper to enjoy the show. After the show was over, I guess the owner didn't want all the pesky customers to hang around and enjoy another drink while they talk about the magic show. It was probably a better idea to go back to blasting techno at full volume and to initiate a fully overstimulating light show for an empty room. I am being generous by maintaining 2 stars instead of dropping them down to one. They are so lucky this magic show was in their establishment. It was so entertaining, its the only reason I'd be caught dead at A Plus VIP Lounge.",

The issue with this place is that it's clearly owned by people who have not spent much time in a nightclub.  First, if you're going to buy bottles, there should be no cover charge.  Second, if you're asking about bottles at the door, there should be at least 2 hosts (and the owner if it's as slow as it was that night) greeting you and asking how they can help.  The drinks are under poured, the cups and under sized and I was less than impressed with the clientele.  If you want people to spend lots of money in your club, then you need to dress the part.  Sadly, this place isn't going to survive . . .",

I definitely need to go check the wine list myself! Maybe you should, too. One more thing to say, I have read other comments below and here's my thoughts: Walking into VIP zone or fled with unpayed bill, that's not the club's fault I guess? Let you stay the VIP zone is just been nice and charge before serve is just being cautious as far as I can tell. Anyway, check it out urself and prove whether I'm right or wrong!",

We decided to come at around midnight on a Saturday to give it a shot.We were pleasantly surprised to find there was no cover charge, but quickly found out perhaps why that was.... there was hardly anyone in the place, practically empty!We scoped the place out before ordering and I was actually impressed with the ambiance and dcor, it really has the look and feel of a city nightclub or lounge. It was extremely clean and well-kept which is a nice change of pace from the notoriously scummy campus bars. I asked for a menu to look at the cocktail list, I ordered a \"Taurus\" and my roommate got an \"Innocent Eyes\". I very much enjoyed mine, I thought it was a really tasty cocktail. He thought his may have been a little on the weak side. These were $8 each, a little expensive, but in all fairness it was a great cocktail I would order over and over. My only reservation about the price was because I could have sworn I seen the bartender(s) use the well liquor in my drink, and I would at least expect something a little better than wells for an $8 drink.  A cranberry vodka I had later was ~$5. Other friend was a little disappointed they didn't know how to make a \"Singapore Sling\", which perhaps might have been more likely at a nicer place like this, oh well, not a big deal. He did like the Mai Tai they mixed up though. The place uses the goofy iPad/tablet for when you close a tab or buy a drink with a card, which is a pet peeve of mine, especially when our intoxicated group can't figure out how to work the damn thing.They had a DJ that night and the music was typical mixed top 40 stuff, not necessarily my style, but I have heard worse and the volume was not entirely unbearable. The ~10 other people in there had taken spots up from closer to the DJ while our crew hung out towards the back and more or less watched. This girl, bless her heart, approached us and asked what it would take to get us up front dancing in terms of a song. Drunken me blurts out \"Stayin' Alive\" by the Bee Gees since the group kind of hesitated. It was the first thing that came to mind and it's a dancing classic for anyone who appreciates music of that style and vintage. She looked a little confused and didn't seem to know the song, but alas went up and requested the DJ play it, which after a quick dirty look he reluctantly did. We had our couple minutes of fame, embarrassed ourselves, and returned to our table and resumed observing everyone else.I really think this place has some potential to be awesome. Unfortunately, the location isn't on campus and I'd expect most students don't necessarily know about A Plus VIP Lounge. I would definitely say there is a customer base for this type of establishment at UIUC, students just don't seem to be aware of it and consequently draws more local people. They should do some campus advertising, maybe even have a one time (or more often) discounted Friday or Saturday drink special to get the ball rolling.Maybe we came on a bad night, it was a little rainy/drizzly so that could be a factor.I will definitely come back.",

My wife ordered a tofu dish (not sure exactly which one) which was excellent. She also wished that she had ordered the full portion.The prices were fair and we had a good first experience here. We will return.",

Sure a lot of people have said this can be hit or miss, but I find the hummus sandwiches to be excellent every time.  They always have fresh veggies on them and have a lot of flavor, plus the homemade wheat bread is awesome.  The sweet potato and corn chowder is quite good as well.  Alas I still haven't been able to try the cornbread, it seems they always run out within the two people ordering in front of me, so get there early if you can.  The coffee isn't outstanding, for that  I would walk down the street to Espresso. Great place to support and cheap eats, I usually spend no more than $6.  Basically you should go if you are on campus for lunch and want a healthy alternative to chains on green st.",

The staff is always friendly and welcoming and they know their dishes enough to make great recommendations. In short, whether you are vegan or not you should visit The Red Herring and enjoy a great lunch served with a smile in a place that begs for a good book or a good friend to join you. Try it.

This place is not that and I didn't know this going in. The hippies and the sloppy \"chill, man\" attitude around the joint quickly made me realize what I was in for and I was right. The food was OK, as in I can, and do, make it at home so it's not very interesting. The portions were HUGE and the price a bit steep; I'd rather pay less for a smaller portion. The place is definitely unique but not as great as I though it should be; I kept hearing such great things that I expected more. But, I'll give them another try sometime to see if it gets better.",

The ordering process is inefficient, with very little thought put into organization of the process.Basically, this place has all of the drawbacks of a small, quirky cafe, with virtually none of the payoff.

On top of that I made the trip out there on four separate occasions only to find the place was closed with a note on the door saying \"Sorry we are too tired to cook today.  Here's a recipe if you want to make your own dinner.\"  WTF.

The specials never fail to delight, so much so that I went six months never trying a regular menu item because I was so entranced by the daily specials.  The BBQ seitan is outta control good--so fantastic that I find myself picking up the escaping pieces of seitan with my fingers and then licking the sauce off.  The falafel is phenomenal as well.  Meat-eaters, have no fear.  I've brought many a devout omnivore to Red Herring, and they've raved about their eats as well.  The chef does a fantastic job of dreaming up dishes that are flavorful and filling (and still pretty damn cheap).  I find the whole sandwich fills me up nicely for $5, and the specials are always a meal-and-a-half for a bit more.I'm sad they weren't able to keep dinner service going, but I've got my fingers crossed they'll revisit that another time.  Red Herring, thank you for satisfying my stomach, making sure this mostly vegan gal never feels frustrated grabbing a lunch out, and helping me feel completely guiltless about eating out.",

However, thanks to the Red Herring, I have been converted to the veggie cause. The Red Herring is staffed by dedicated volunteers and generally these are people quite knowledgeable in the ways to making vegetables delectable. It's a small place, nothing fancy, but it's quite nice for a non-for-profit establishment. On a cold day there I always like to get their $3.00 bowl of vegetable soup with corn bread. The soups, like the entrees and desserts, vary each day. Some days might be better or worse than others, but I can usually find something I like. The corn bread is the wonderful constant in this equation. It's soft and melts in your mouth. Besides the cornbread, the next best thing is the ingredients. They use lots of local and organic products.Even if you are not exactly crunchy and you like your red meat, I suggest trying The Red Herring. Hopefully you'll be pleasantly surprised.P.S. They are now serving dinner.",

Anyplace that satisfies my evening grubbin' needs that cheaply can make the whole day seem even better.Down the steep stairs and into the warm scent of good hippie eats.  You get in line, toss your fiver in a basket, and are given large portions of whatever they cooked up.Tonight was rice, veggies with Indian flavors, kick-ass lentil soup, and a brownie.  Drinks cost extra, water is free with dinner.  You can eat as much food as can be shoveled down.The atmosphere is like a laid-back commune, with a smattering of all campus types.  Punk, hippie, geek, frat/soror, etc.  It's a really friendly place with a community-building-is-awesome vibe.My friends who've been in town awhile say it can be a tad hit or miss.  Tonight was for the win, fo' sho'.  Another tip I was given is to bring a Tupperware.  If you accidentally get more seconds than you can eat, you'll be able to have some noms for lunch the next day.  Or, ya know, snacking on the way home.  It might be a little less karma free that way, though...",

All food is freshly prepared, their main menu item changes every day.  On top of this all it's fairly cheap as well.  Definitely a place you have to go and try out.That said, I have talked to a connected friend who told me horror stories about the management changes as well.  I guess it passes between different people since it's run by the Unitarians and there is some sort of committee for it.  Apparently sometimes the place was not run in a, shall we say, cleanly and efficient manner.  That said, I hear the current manager, just like nifty c. says, is very good and the place is top quality.",

(Not sure if you can tell, she's a big fan!)I ordered half a hummus pita with a garden salad on the side. I actually liked the hummus, although I don't eat hummus as much as I'd like to. There were lots of fresh veggies in there, although the distribution through my little pita pocket was a bit awkward. (Chock full o' hummus on one side, lots of veggies on the other.) I ordered the salad with the sesame tahini, but I wasn't a huge fan of the tahini. I don't eat tahini often, though, so maybe I'm just not a tahini person? (The vinaigrette would've complemented the meal better.) The meal was served with some plain popcorn.I found my meal okay, but I would definitely be cautious to omnivores (and especially carnivores xD). Many of the people I was eating with were pretty dissatisfied with the flavors in their food? Even the little bottle of hot sauce (I think it was a kind of salsa?) wasn't really doing much to quench their hunger. I'm a bit more used to vegetarian food, but if your friends aren't used to vegetarian food, this is probably not the place to try to introduce them to it.I liked the atmosphere of the restaurant, but again, it can come off as \"weird\" and \"hippie-ish\" for people who aren't used to it. We had a guy playing BOTH the guitar and the xylophone up front and, not going to lie, he was reinforcing the stereotype of \"hippie-ish\" in this restaurant with his look a wee bit, according to some of my lunchmates.But I liked it. There was a little station for you to fill up on water, iced tea, or hot tea, cane sugar, organic teas... considering that you're not paying a whole lot, I thought that you got a pretty great deal, ESPECIALLY if you are a vegetarian or a vegan, you know? However, if you're bringing a friend who has never heard of seitan and doesn't really like that organic feel, then this is the wrong place to bring him/her. If you're into that, though, this is an AWESOME place. Even the back of the bathroom door contributed to the overall feel of this restaurant that I had to descend into. It is very much like a co-op (if you've been to one before), but I'll admit, not everyone is going to love it. I personally liked it, though.",

Otherwise, you should enjoy.Go and at least check out this awesome local community spot that really seems to care about the area around it.  Good call. :)One note, they only take cash, much like the Y-Thai.

Don't worry, you are in the right place, restaurant itself is in the lower level of the house. There is a second entrance from Oregon St. that allows you to enter directly though the basement as well. The staff is every welcoming and helpful with any questions you may have about the menu. The specials are always changing, so be sure to ask what is new. There is a noticeable rush during the lunch and dinner hours, but if you go in the morning or mid-afternoon it can be a nice, quite place to get a little work done. This place definitely has that hippie/divey vibe about it. I absolutely love the colorful interior! I went to one of their open mic nights with some friends and they had a nice little stage area in the corner that worked well. It very much feels like a place that is aware of the community, with all of the information and local ads on their boards.Stop in sometime and see what the specials are or what programs are taking place!",

Where do I start?My typical memory of it would be walking in on a blisteringly cold day. I'd be greeted by steamy warm, earthy air. My glasses would fog up and I'd go blind for a moment. Once the fog disappeared I'd be greeted with a wide variety of the community - from the still thinks-it's-the-70s hippie to the like-oh-my-god-check-out-my-North-Face-fleece! sorority girl - everybody is represented. Definitely more hippies than greeks - but yeah. I suppose I fall in the middle there and never felt out of place.The place is staffed mostly by volunteers who as I recall get paid with a meal for a certain amount of work. Go there for a little while and you'll quickly get to know the staff - they're all great.So next it's time to order. They have their daily menu listed and it's always different. Prices are not bad - $5-8 will get you a full meal as I recall.So the food - I have yet to buy something here that wasn't fantastic. Maybe I'm easy to please (as some of the other reviewers would make one think) - but geeze - it's all so great! There is a clear stand out though - the BBQ tempeh sandwich. I've tried to recreate this item at home (since I now live halfway across the country!) but I just can't get it as good as Red Herring did.I've taken many people here - from red blooded meat lovers to normal folk and everybody else - and I have yet to hear a complaint. Fantastic place - highly recommended!",

I was with a friend, at the time.  An extremely good friend.  Neither one of us knew what to expect, or how to really proceed, but two mushroom risotto later, and.. I mean.. LIFE. CHANGED. right there.This place is a cash and carry.  You pay for the plate, and if you're part of the collective, you sweep your own dishes.  No one pampers you, here, but that's not really the point of what they're doing.  They're just doing warm, sincere, totally honest food (on par with any haute cuisine), keeping it free from anything that isn't vegetable or mineral (and plenty of carbs ;D).  Truly, spectacular, filling food for a great price.  Just don't come in expecting a waitress or to pay with your plastic.  That's a no go.TRH is still one of Urbana's best kept secrets.

                "review": "NEW MANAGEMENT ALERT!  The Red Herring is a local institution but the quality changes dramatically as the place has passed through many hands.  I recall with some fear the staff of years past: one cashier enjoyed candidly sharing with me stories of their disagreements with the health department.  (This was as I ordered food.)  But that has changed.  The new manager is reportedly the same person who originally opened the place in the 1970s (says the cashier).  As a regular visitor for seven years, I found the effect striking.The food was good!  Not just a passable alternative option as Mimi N. wrote, or something that vegetarians must eat out of desperation after they tire of green salad and fruit plate from the local chains.  The red herring is not the only option for those with a lentil craving anymore.  It is a place that you might actually go to for the food -- food that is actually good.  It didn't taste like the Red Herring I know at all; it tasted a lot better.I had the corn chowder and the ingredients were obviously carefully selected and very fresh.  The kernels had a crisp, sweet bite.  The toasted mozzarella sandwich was also a treat with good quality cheese and fresh bread.Unfortunately, while change is good in this case, I did notice the portion sizes have declined dramatically.  Maybe they are still working this out?  (I hope.)I spent $7 for a half sandwich and cup of soup, and almost immediately I found that I had to go out to a second lunch.  It was the smallest half sandwich I have ever been seriously offered and charged for.  At first I mistook it for a sample or a scrap trimmed from someone else's sandwich.  I would have preferred a bowl of soup but this tiny cup size was the only choice.  $7 for a sandwich trimming and a tiny cup of soup is a little steep around here.So enjoy the food but don't order half of anything -- the result will be too small.  Rest assured that the crunchy atmosphere you love is still there... but cleaner.  The staff still seems to be the kind of staff that will say \"Peace out!\" after you complete your order and will lend you money if you are short.Peace out!",

Some of the pastries are better.  They sent out burnt french toast to me the other day (and not lightly: pretty black and charred). Manager did take one look when I walked it back to the counter and instantly ordered another one for me: so that was fast and helpful.  But, how how did it come out in the first place? staff cooked and hand delievered it: maybe without lookin at it? A brief apology would have made things nicer (a quick \"I'm sorry\" from that manager would have done, but not even that).Two different visits the coffee was mislabeled or served in the wrong container (e.g. flavored coffee in the \"dark roast\" bin). Letting them know was a shrug and an \"okay, I'll look at it when I finish sorting these boxes\")Staff is friendly but often are giggling at inside jokes or talking with each other while taking your order.Summary: not horrible, but low attention to detail and customer service and mediocre food means Panera is probably a better choice.",

I guess the comparison can't be helped as they're both soup and sandwich chains, but my answer: absolutely not.  I harbor a special love for Panera in my heart that Atlanta will never compete with, no matter how many tries I give it.  My visit today pretty much confirmed that.A fist-sized portion of bread is served with most meals.  In the past, I've always been turned off by their bread, which is usually pale and under-baked.  I don't have much faith in a place that claims to be a \"bread company,\" but serves such sorry bread.  On my most recent visit, the baguette wasn't disturbingly discolored and it had a nice crunch to the crust.  I also noticed a subtle hint of olive oil in the bread's recipe.  Maybe they're making a few improvements.Like most lunch chains, I'm sure the soup comes packaged and is heated in-store.  I ordered the chicken and wild rice soup today.  Highlights: the soup had conspicuous specks of pepper and bright green chives.  Unfortunately, it also had the color and consistency of glue...  I suspect that the grain had broken down and congealed into a thick paste that was not appetizing.Atlanta also separates itself from Panera by serving a few additional items on their menu, including pastas.  My vegan lunch buddy tells me that Atlanta is a little more generous to those with dietary restrictions, though I don't have any special recommendations to vegetarians/vegans out there.",

The lettuce was not fresh and I had a lot of pieces of lettuce that had the hard white vein running through the middle of the leaf. Ick. They don't have french dressing so I went with the honey mustard which was another bad choice.

A pretty good place for lunch and studying, though.  It's never gotten too loud during lunchtime or right after lunch, but sometimes they shut off the free wifi from 11:30am-1:30pm to deter people with laptops from hanging around during that time.  Large booths and tables tend to be a pretty good size, big enough for a couple people to study at.   Unfortunately, they close pretty early during the week and on the weekends, forcing people to pack up and go somewhere else.  Overall, not bad for food and studying, but not great for those who are looking for somewhere to study at night.",

She seems distracted the whole time, so I'm pretty sure she just wasn't paying attention. The cashiers were rather chatty, which is totally fine, except they were ignoring waiting customers just so they could finish their conversation. Very unprofessional, not to mention annoying.As for the food...meh. I ordered the veggie panini and was not impressed. The bread was soggy and all sorts of mashed, and the filling was pretty flavorless (haven't they heard of herbs?). It came with a pickle and chips, which you can't really mess up. All in all, I was not happy with this place, and I won't be eating there again.Honestly, just go to Panera. The food is better and the service is usually on point.",

What I like about Atlanta is the breakfast menu.  There are several omelets and all are decent, though not exceptional.  The accompanying potatoes are so-so and usually cold.  Toast is always soggy.  The breakfast sandwiches are decent.  I have breakfast there every day during the week as it is near my workplace.  I have something different each day and the price is reasonable and the food is tolerable.  Under $5 for a three eggs omelet, potatoes, and toast isn't too bad.  I've tried all the omelets and two of the breakfast sandwiches and while they won't win any culinary rewards, they are filling and somewhat tasty.  Somewhat.  Do I recommend this place?  Well, like many such places, it's hit and miss.  Don't go with high expectations and you will be okay.  It's not gourmet food or haute cuisine but you'll probably find something you like and will enjoy.",

My daughter and I were in a hurry and we stopped in at 10:00 AM on  Thursday, January 15, 2015. We ordered  two bagels, toasted, with cream cheese. We learned that the service that is connected with this involves tossing a portion control packet of cream cheese into a paper bag and throwing in a plastic knife. We asked for them to toast the bagels and spread the cheese on them.  For this we got snarls.There were five employees standing around chatting among themselves but the person wearing the manager badge was doing food preparation on the customer service of some large bowl of chopped bread. When she coughed right over the bowl of chopped bread it was not a good sign.11 minutes later there was no sign of our bagels. Nor was there any sign of activity from the five idle workers. So I inquired. One of them told me that the \"cheap bastard\" that owns the place has refused to fix the toaster on the front service line so our food has to be prepared back in the kitchen the manager then said they're working on it.15 minutes after we walked in the door on a business day with no customers ahead of us we left with two toasted bagels and the manager promised me it wouldn't be this bad the next time we came. I promised her there wouldn't be a next time.",

For just a little over 20 dollars we received an Avocado sandwich, Turkey Bacon Rustica sandwich, and a strawberry smoothie. Well.... The avocado was quartered and put on the sandwich which made the greenish brown bits slippery thus, fall out frequently onto your plate instead of in your mouth. To top this the avocado had the stem attached. What could make this any better? Perhaps the bread wasn't quite leavened to the point of a bakery shop's presumed reason to exist. I'm not sure why we actually ate this (We were quite hungry). The Turkey Rustica wasn't that much better. For having the word bacon in it, I do not remember actually being able to taste any sort of bacon within its contents. The bread also seemed to be a bit stale, but it was at least cooked correctly. To be fair some of the more finer points is that this place made a good tasting smoothie (although, one can argue how hard that is). Being from the west coast, perhaps I am just a snood to what a good upscale bakery/sandwich/cafe shop should be. This is not that kind of example.",

However, Atlanta is a little closer to the main drags, and the local Paneras (esp. the Old Farm one) have such throngs of retirees, locals, students, meetings, etc. that it can be a zoo at certain times.",

The dishes I had did consist of fresh ingredients, but I think they were more healthfully prepared which made them not quite that super sodium-y fatty Panera tasty.  It was really clean in there, but I kind of got the feeling that was only because it was brand new and that in 6 months it would be grimy.  The staff were really friendly, but it was a very forced friendliness.The free wifi is cool.  If it were closer to campus, I would probably think it was a great place to have a working lunch or a sticky bun while doing more work after work.",

While I was waiting on line I Wikipediaed them turns out it's a knock off. Basically in 1993 the creator of AB visited a PB and figured that if he stole basically everything down to the warm earthy decor of PB he would have a successful place. At its peak there was 250 franchised locations across the US in 2014 there are about 50 still standing. So I'm assuming that this Atlanta bread here in champaign has been a successful franchise because it's one of the few survivors. I had a cheddar broccoli soup and a Caesar salad. Soup was solid, salad was decent. The portion sizes on both were generous. I liked that after you order they bring the food out to you. I didn't like that they blatantly ripped off Panera bread. I did notice they have pizza on the menu so I guess that's their highlighted difference between Panera bread. So yeah if you like soup salad bread or Panera you will probably like this place.",

But I didn't know what sandwich to pick so I asked which ones were ordered more often.  I chose the grilled chicken pesto pannini and it wasn't very good.  I can't imagine anyone ordering this pannini for a second time.  The chicken tasted old and the pesto had no flavor.  It even looked unappealing too.

The bread was about half of the baguette size at Panera (which seems to be the obvious comparison, and similarly overpriced), and I felt that the soup quality (approximately cream of potato) and portion size were low on both counts.I have been here at least 3 times, that I can remember, and have had similar feelings each time. My previous visits were for sandwich/soup combos that were definitely not worth remembering.  The building and location are both nice, and convenient to my work, but I can't say for certain that I'll return soon.",

Now I know they are supposed to be sweet, creamy, fragrant, and oh so good.  Aroma has some of the best coffee I've ever had (but it's definitely not cheap), as well as a variety of delicious real food.  Store is cute, with a nice patio out back, but it's not the biggest place and if you're looking for a place to study and it's after lunch, you'll probably be out of luck here.  Otherwise, it's one of my favorite places to camp out (provided I woke up early enough on a Saturday morning).",

Love it, sometimes I don't know where I'd be without a coffee of the day and a smile, and I know I'll find that everytime at Aroma.",

Every latte I've had from Aroma has been simply delicious and perfect to taste.  You should definitely try the cranberry and brie sexy toast!  It's taste like a slice of thanksgiving in your mouth...I crave it often! Also try their soups!  They always change up their soup menu, can't go wrong!  One thing that I really enjoy about this spot is it's an older crowd not a ton of college kids that are camping out like Kopi so there's always a place for you to relax while you sip away on your coffee.",

The Italian soda was pretty normal, using Da Vinci syrup.Both the roast beef wrap and mango chicken wrap were fresh and light with a good mix of flavors. The cream cheese is from local sources which you can clearly taste from the first bite. The sides of salad and fruit were both fresh and flavorful.I will definitely return here on my next trip downstate.",

Understated Middle-Eastern sides like hummus and tabouleh further enhance a menu that still includes classic Aroma fare like the Cuban sandwich and quesadillas.Aroma has come a long way in a short time.  I look forward to future encounters.",

I am still looking for a place like this in Chicago.The only downside is the corrupt little ***hole that the city of Champaign is, which imagines itself to be downtown Chicago or Manhattan.  In other words, the biggest problem with this place is that you need to run out every two hours to feed the stupid meter.  But, of course, that's not Aroma's fault so they get 5 stars from me, and if you read my other reviews, you'll see that I don't give out stars that easily.",

Their Aroma Salad is so yummy - usually not a fan of those kind of salads (i'm in the basic kind, not fancy with nuts, etc.) but I enjoyed it a lot.

I mean of course Chicago or New York has MUCH better coffee houses than Aroma Cafe, but if you're in Champaign-Urbana Aroma Cafe is as good as it gets, at least coffee wise. Enviornment: 3.5/5, Drinks: 5/5Their prices are insanely reasonable and they give out a generous discount for bringing your own cup. The quality of the beans is also very good, which rocks. While Cafe Kopi (the coffee house just a street away from Aroma Cafe) roasts very well too, they can't make drinks worth shit. They don't even know how to steam milk! I got a latte their once and the milk wasn't steamed, just warmed up with the steam wand. I also rate Aroma Cafe highly because their prep, the way they make the drinks, is very good. Aroma Cafe actually uses a manual grinder for their espresso drinks! It's amazing! :D Most places just put the group head into an automatic. Their back bar might need a tid bit of work but I mean I'm getting really picky. I just feel bad for the usual lone barista doing all of the work.In any case, if you're in Champaign-Urbana and want a quality cup of coffee this is the place to go. Cafe' Paradiso's just too expensive and every other coffe house has no idea what their doing.",

The coffee menu is limited and the baristas don't know how to make anything that's not explicitly on the menu (that's cool because this should not be expected of them, but it's just a major downside).I asked if they made cold brew and they offered me hot espresso on ice. That worries me. The food is very basic, low-involvement, no special ingredients, yet pricey. Also worth mentioning, the WiFi is abhorrent. Connection is too weak in all areas of the restaurant to even display text. And your session expires after a few hours and you are not able to start a second one. Just a heads up for people who want to stay and study. I don't know if it was a purposeful way to boot campers out. I've never had this happen to me at a cafe. Finally, the background music is awful, in my opinion. They play nonstop 80s pop: Cyndi Lauper, Michael Jackson, Olivia Newton-John, etc. So bring headphones if you're not into that.",

The atmosphere is usually quieter than Kopi, and there is plenty of seating on most days; the staff is friendly and polite and know their way around a kitchen. There are outlets all along the walls, and free wifi, if that's what you're looking for. *See edit*I'm addicted to the vanilla chai, but I really go there for the raspberry white chocolate scones. I challenge you to find a better scone in the world! Okay, well, maybe not the world, but they trump any pastry in every coffee shop I've ever visited. When I've been on the road, this is the first place I come back to. Aroma is home!Also, the salsa here is amazing. It is house-made and there are two kinds: try the one with the peaches. I get it as a side with my cheese quesadilla, which is also tasty and totally worth spending my lunch money on!Edit: 5/20/2012Since I last reviewed Aroma, it has gone through a lot of changes, including new ownership. What's bad about this is they took away almost every single thing I loved. Those unparalleled raspberry white chocolate scones? Gone. Now they serve bloated English scones from Sweet Indulgences that are as dry and tasteless as the Sahara. Massive, extraordinary fail. I mean, there used to be epic Scone Wars over Aroma's scones--I used to try to beat these elderly ladies who worked downtown to the cafe to get my share. For real. Now the new scones just sit on a plate, untouched and unwanted, fat blobs of loathing. Anybody who likes them never had the original, heavenly scones of old. They're not even in the same category of pastry, I tell you. They offer other pastries from Sweet Indulgences, too, but they're all really expensive and not what I would eat for breakfast. (Old habits die hard.) They still sell apple fritters, I guess.They tried to get rid of my beloved chai, as well, but then the new baristas were too mentally challenged to make bagged chai tea and they had to revert back to the mix. I guess leaving a tea bag in a cup of steamed milk requires too much comprehension. I'm glad for it, anyway, because if natural bagged chai is your thing, nobody in town is better than Kopi, which is just around the block. Competing against them is just a waste of time, so they're safer to keep the chai mix and go with what their customers already know and love.Also, that amazing peach salsa? Yup, it's gone now, too. Forever. The whole menu has been revamped to have fancier, slightly healthier offering. I haven't been desperate enough to try any of their new food items except for the fruit salad, which is basically a bowl of chopped fruit with a yummy syrup over it, and that was good, but it was just for breakfast. I will say they seem to have spared most of their old menu's wraps and other lunch items for the time being. The Wi-Fi is also password-protected now (\"sexytoast\" is the key). At least they didn't insert that proposed \"kid corner\" they threatened us with earlier during the revamp. That would've sent me running for the hills instantly. As someone who comes in here regularly to find quiet and write, I can tell you the very last thing I want is to share space with a corner of screaming, running toddlers. I deducted Aroma a star for all of this, but find it hard to give it less than 4 stars. I've been coming to Aroma for seven years, so I think of it as my home away from home, even if it currently is a shell of what it once was. Some of the other regular customers I used to see in here are thinning out. I guess all of this will make it easier for when I move from Champaign, because now it's just depressing.",

The other guy behind the counter practically argued with me when I explained the drink was \"wrong\" simply by the sheer weight of the cup. Finally, they redid it, but it was still the worst cappuccino I have ever had there.The atmosphere is nice, and food is not bad. However, the snack selection is practically non-existent. For that, you gotta hit Pekara next door.Odd Aroma Cafe story: one Sunday, I ask for a San Pellegrino. The tall kid behind the counter says he can't serve it to me. \"Why?\" I ask. \"Because I'm under-age\" comes the answer. Wooot! You gotta be kidding, kid. After picking myself up off the floor, I explain it's fizzy water, he asks someone for help, I get the bottle (no brown paper bag) and we get outta there.

If you know latte, then you must know Cafe Aroma. The consistency from barista to barista is not the same, so I send a word of caution. I have my favorite latte rainmaker, and I ask him for his schedule so I can come when he's there. I'm serious. The owner also is there often, and he absolutely knows what he is doing when it comes to making the perfect latte. Things like this are too important to play with.

Thirdly, what really does it for me, is that baristas are all incredibly friendly and kind. I have had lots of little conversations with them and they are always polite and courteous.

Mmm the best! Aroma didn't disappoint their version of the Cuban very close to the Miami one. Everything else terrific. Added bonus: stroke up a conversation with Jerry, terrific guy, wearing a UF gator shirt, told him about our Cuban food and drink craving and ....dios mio!

My iced mocha tasted like chocolate milk (was there half a shot in there, or what?) and the veggie wrap was only \"meh\" although it sounded really great on the menu.My drink tasted alright, despite lacking any kick, but the price is really what made it bad.  For a SMALL espresso drink that didn't taste like it had any espresso in it, I paid $3.80.  Whaa?I do like that the sandwiches and such come with a choice of side, and that none of the sides will cost you extra.  At Cafe Kopi, you have to pay extra for certain sides, including the side salad.  I liked the salad that came with my wrap, although there were a few pieces of wilted/gross lettuce.  I was underwhelmed by the wrap but would probably try a full-size salad from here.However, since Cafe Kopi is right around the corner and serves way better drinks, I don't know if I'll ever bother giving Aroma Cafe a second chance.",

The food is good, but their portions are a little small. A lunch with a large coffee is always $8-9. For $5.95 pretax, you get one of their sandwiches and moderately generous side of fruit salad, salad, or chips. They are cheaper than Pekara and Kopi. Make sure you check out their soup of the day, as they are always good and a soup and an Aroma sandwich combo is guaranteed to satisfy. They have pastries for sale, but I don't know why. The pastries at Pekara (next door) are way better. They also have a morning Bagel and Coffee deal for $3.50 that is pretty good: they have a bunch of different bagel and cream cheese varieties.They also offer a discount if your work in Downtown Champaign, but they do not advertise this.",

They have boundless flavors to choose from, but the flavors that I have had were a little too sweet for my taste, a bit more like Starbucks-sweet than I would prefer. Additionally, although I have never ordered coffee from here, I had some of my friend's on my last visit, and it was nothing memorable. I may come back one day to try the food, but when it comes to coffee drinks, there are plenty of other places in Champaign-Urbana that I can go to.",

The food is also quite good, unlike a lot of other coffee shops I've tried.  Try the quesadilla or the Aroma Salad.  Good music, too!  My only beef with them is that they close super-early in the evenings during semester break, meaning that those of us who actually LIVE here don't get to partake while the students are gone.  I would understand if Aroma were located closer to campus and got the vast majority of their business from college students, but every time I'm there, I see quite a few non-students, so I see no reason for them to close early.",

Total for the wrap and side (not including drink, as I got a free glass of water you pour yourself) was about $8. That's a good deal in my opinion, as 1/2 the wrap filled me up, and I'm a guy.

It's mostly street parking, but I found lots of spots right out front.The lovely lady working welcomed us right away, and she was very helpful with her suggestions. I decided on a large light roast Ethiopian and an oatmeal, and the Mister got a large dark roast of some sort and a cinnamon roll as big as my head. The ceramic coffee mugs were huge, and the coffee was delicious. They even had organic cane syrup to sweeten it! My oatmeal was pre-packaged, but it was one of the healthier brands without anything artificial or tons of sugar. The Mister loved his goodies as well.The interior of Aroma Cafe is very cozy, but we decided to sit on the patio out back. It felt secret garden-ish, and it was the perfect setting for a lazy Sunday breakfast. If you're in the CU area, then you should totally check out this place.

It's your typical cafe, but they have a fairly wide variety of menu items and you get a good deal with their daily specials.They have lots of seating indoors (including some cushy chairs by a fireplace in the back), and something I especially appreciated was the abundance of outlets!  There's nothing more frustrating than getting to a cafe that either a) has wireless, but you gotta pay for it, or b) has free wireless, but only two outlets for the patrons to fight over.After ordering my hummus plate, I grabbed a table by the wall, plugged myself in, connected to the free internet, and spent a nice evening relaxing....  at least that's what I would've liked to have said.  I was actually scrambling to finish an assignment before they closed up for the day, haha.  The warm pita bread and fresh, crisp cucumbers that came with the hummus was very tasty though =)They have a bunch of outdoor seating out back as well for when the weather is nice.",

Now the sign says \"For Now Hours\" so who knows what it will be next time?  They didn't have anything that looked that tempting, but I had a huge sweet tooth, and tried a brownie.  It was hard as a rock.  I should have taken it back, but I didn't because I would have had to sit their and drink my coffee anyway since I was given one of their tiny \"here\" cups (which probably wouldn't have taken me too long in reality).~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~update 11/15/2008:I have dropped Aroma just an \"eh\" rating...Cafe Kopi was horribly crowded, so I trudged back out into the cold and headed to Aroma.  There was a nice size table free, and it's much brighter in there (which I found jarring at first, but got used to it).  I ordered my standard \"Grande House Coffee\" and when asked \"for here or to go\" I said \"for here\" because I had planned to stay to do some homework.  Well she gave me my coffee in this tiny little mug.  I asked her, \"Is this a grande?\" and she looked at me, said yes, and showed me an even tinier mug for their smalls.  There was not 16 oz of hot coffee in that tea cup.  Barely 12 oz would be my guess.  They TOTALLY short change you on the \"for here\" cups, so I would recommend getting a \"to go\" cup even if you plan on staying.  Which is unfortunate when \"going green\" is the thing to do...  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~On an early Sunday right after moving to Champaign, I was wandering around the downtown area to see what was around, and stopped in here for a coffee and a muffin.  It's cute, there's lots of tables, free WiFi (although I didn't have my computer, I saw a couple of people with laptops out), and the people behind the counter were nice.  There's a comfy spot in the back with couches and chairs and a fireplace!  (not sure if it works though)  And they have an outdoor area as well.  The coffee was good, and if you buy one of their travel mugs, you get a discount every time you bring it in to get your coffee.  The hours are great for studying.  Overall: it's cute, and I can see myself heading back there in the future.",

I appreciated the friendly service and the selection of quality brews they had to offer. You just can't beat iced coffee that is made to order, freshly brewed on the spot rather than being served from a big pitcher of premade refrigerated coffee. I also had one of the lemon cake balls and oh good grief that was delicious! The center of the cake ball had something similar to a lemon curd, which was a very pleasant tart surprise.

It's pretty much your average coffee shop, but a few things stand out. One - they have sugar free almond syrup. Yum! It's one of my favorite flavors, but rarely do I find it in the sugar free variety. Two - they have a fireplace. I'm assuming it works, although I've never actually been in Aroma when it's on. Third - they have a nice patio. Although I really wish they would upgrade their patio chairs. They have the flimsy plastic kind that suck. Spend a few more bucks and get something similar to your neighbor, Pekara.Their bakery case never looks too appealing. I'd skip on over to Pekara if you're looking for a nosh, but Aroma is a-ok for a coffee or tea.",

I do enjoy the taro milk tea though! I also really like their cartoon animal cups and lid covers that sort of teach you Chinese fruit names. Depending on when you come, there may be a large crowd of people, which means your order will take some time to make as they make everything to order - nothing is premade. Also, they don't allow for customizations. You can only get what's offered on the menu - no fruit substitutions, etc. Unfortunately, there are only two tables to sit at, so you'll likely be standing around while waiting. I hope they'll get more chairs and tables because there's a lot more room in the shop.My one pet peeve is that some of the fruit syrup they use to flavor their milk teas tastes weirdly artificial. I got a strawberry milk tea and it tasted like I was drinking a liquid, watered down strawberry ring pop. I tried a friend's mango green tea and it was ridiculously sweet with a tang of mango. Otherwise, it's not very remarkable milk tea that would make me come back.I'd give them two and a half stars, but I bumped it to three because the service is really nice and the employees do try very hard to get the orders correct. Also, when I came on Friday as they were closing up and finishing the last orders, the owner lady gave me and my friends free drinks to try anyway, which was sweet of her. Everything on the menu is relatively inexpensive and under $5.",

I would probably prefer to come for breakfast, but that wasn't in the cards today.The service was very good. Our waitress was polite, food came in a reasonable time, and drinks were refilled regularly. We were also brought our check in a speedy manner, which I always like.Food: I had a buffalo chicken wrap, my wife had a hamburger and my son had a reuben sandwich and fries. All the food was very good.The only negative is the scrum at the front door/register when you are on the waiting list or paying your bill. Of course, part of the charm of Courier is the old time feeling the place gives, and a large waiting room would probably detract from that.Next trip: breakfast!",

Wonderbread with an anorexic serving of meat and a pickle spear for $8 or more.We had to get up and walk around to find an employee who would take our money. The couple next to us got up and left because nobody would take their order.Inexcusably bad service, inexplicably bad food. Come on, Urbana, for once, accept the fact that some businesses are meant to die. In case you don't get out much, the Courier Cafe is terrible. They are operating as if they have no competition.Suffering through a shit sandwich and bad service is a stupid way of supporting local business. Unless you're into self-punishment and leather and... you know, in that case, join the priesthood.",

I don't know to describe to be Old Victorian but it is old school for sure. The seats are all wood, wooden floors, dim lighting, classic wooden benches, and there is even an old school cash register. Definitely a blast in the past to the early 20th century. Very classy and clean place that had a warm, home feeling.The food? What can I say. AMAZING. It is just simple, American, home-cooking! I have had just about everything from the awesome burgers (which come in a ton of different ways), steak sandwich, soups, deep fried shrimp, most of the pies, and the sundaes. Best of all, it's all fairly cheap!The service was also awesome! I went here with a large party of nearly 20 people and I went here with just 3. Both times the service was amazing. There is this elderly guy there with glasses and he is just very nice, funny, and personable to us every time.I have made this a regular place for me to go when I am in the Urbana-Champaign area.",

Why?\" and when she saw the menu, she was horrified because the food is essentially, country cooking, burgers, sandwiches.  However, it's the healthiest and freshest and best-tasting venue of its type in the history of CU, and they continue the tradition of Bubby & Zadies by offering a salad bar with amazing offerings.  She was amazed and wanted to come back.  Then, I dragged my 81-year old mom to the place, and she was aching and complaining about the steps and getting there, but she left with a HUGE grin on her face and she had a wonderful time!Best shakes in CU, bar none.Best ice cream deserts in CU, bar none.One of the top-3 venues in CU, the old Courier newspaper offices with plaster-decorated ceilings, tallback wooden booths, and a 1910 feel to it.  Very friendly waittresses !!  The only place I can think of that competes with it in terms of a Venue is a cafe near the old train station, but I think that closed 2 decades ago ...This is a popular late-night place to go after Contra Dancing in Crystal Lake Park, or even dancing at the Regent ballroom.  The food is priced very reasonably and this is one of the few places in CU that is a candidate as a great \"hangout\" ~ a place where you can come all the time, and get to know the staff.DO NOT MISS VISITING THE COURIER CAFE !!!",

The first time I ordered food it was breakfast and my pancakes, both buckwheat and normal, were terribly dry, the eggs were overcooked and tasted like oil, the coffee tasted instant and the price was not cheap like others seem to imply. The second, unfortunate, visit I had some sort of catfish fry which again was covered in grease and was somewhat dry with no real taste of its own, I drowned it in sauce to eat it. The biggest problem, and one I notified them of, was the \" soup\" they were serving that day. The menu listed a creamy corn soup but what arrived was a watery, yet clumpy, mass of starch with bits of tasteless bacon, which I don't eat by the way,  and pieces of canned corn masquerading as soup. I was really disappointed and upset, mainly with the food but neither the, really unfriendly, waitress nor the hostess gave a damn. I'm never coming back; just because something has been around for a long time it does not mean that this thing is good, and that's the case with this cafe.",

The black bean burger while not terrible, just wasn't for me. It was really bloated and mushy which made it difficult to eat. I had to just eat it with a fork. I'm used to something a little more dense and solid like a burger would be. The salad bar was delicious. REALLY great selection and everything was fresh. My one complaint would be that I'm 5 ft 6in, which is not really that short, and it was really difficult to reach toppings and their \"sneeze guard/window\" apparatus is really awkward. But it's worth the hassle. You go up and get your salad, they weigh it and you give the ticket to the sever. I got a very large salad for about $5.  Love this place. Great ambience, great food.",

We waited a while to be seated even though many of the tables were unoccupied (possibly because the host was also the cashier ringing people up as they finished their meals).  As soon as we were seated, I quickly noticed that some of my silverware had dried food stuck and even my elbows stuck to the sticky table.  We ordered the steak and eggs, which lacked seasoning.   The service wasn't too bad.  We had a very friendly waitress, who tried her best to ensure we would enjoy our experience.",

A few days ago, I went with my friend and our two kids (baby and a 2 year old). I got there and stood at the top of the steps for, no joke, 10 minutes before the host even acknowledged me. But they were swamped and I gave him the benefit of the doubt. I've worked in food service. When he finally asked if I \"needed something,\" I was confused. The sign clearly says, \"Please wait to be seated.\" I told him I was waiting for a table, and he said, \"Oh, there's one down there,\" and pointed towards the kitchen. My friend and I took our seats, and the host brought a high chair. Someone brought us water, and another 10 minutes later, our frazzled, odd server came to our table. She asked if we were ready to order, and we looked down and said, \"Well.... we never got any menus....\" She came back with the menus, blamed it on someone else, and we ordered our food. Every time she came to the table, she had some sort of snide comment -- maybe she was just having a bad day or that's her personality, but it was annoying. It would have helped if she would have ever brought us refills, checked to be sure we liked our food, asked if we needed anything else. At the end of the meal, she said, \"Gosh your table is so quiet,\" which we both laughed at. How would she know? She never stopped by!The food, however, was fine. I ordered a Dagwood Sandwich (after the hostess said, \"Well, that's a LOT of food,\" and I politely responded, \"OK and I'll also have a side of fries.\") I got the sandwich with just mustard, no secret sauce or mayo, and it's was pretty good (it was a tall sandwich). I shared the sandwich and fries with my 2 year old. We had a few fries left over, to give you an idea of how much food it ended up being.The bill was about $10 -- on the high end for lunch, but considering it was a large lunch, it seems pretty reasonable.Lunch was fine, but I think I will stick with breakfast at the Courier. They seem too overwhelmed at lunch!",

What I got in return was the bland little sad looking piece of fish about the size of a playing card. It was cod. It was flavorless. It was served with thin slices of lemon on top of it. It served no purposes other than to falsely suggest there would be some lemon-y taste. Also on the plate were three slices of cucumber and a slice of tomato. Not sure why. Perhaps it was there so that I could rate which item was the most bland on the plate.I have been to courier cafe a few times, and I've always ordered some sort of burger or sandwich. They always came out as expected for a sandwich. It tasted good and it was filling. This on the other hand, left me disappointed as I compared the value and price of my meal against my friend who ordered a sandwich that costed less. I left the restaurant hungry and actually went to another nearby restaurant to eat again.",

I had a courier burger (burger with bacon) with fries and coleslaw. I really appreciate how they put the burger toppings on the side of the plate, because it lets you assemble the burger however you want to, and makes the dish more presentable. The burger came out very neat and clean; I didn't have to deal with a sauce-filled, drippy mess, like some other places. It was all very appetizing, though nothing to write home about. I would avoid the coleslaw, however, which was disastrously drenched in mayonnaise, and after a few bites, I just set it to the side untouched. I totally dig the antique-style decor in this restaurant. This is one of Urbana's landmark establishments; if you're looking for a place to enjoy a cozy meal with friends, definitely make a trip over here.",

The other reviewers have summated the greatness of this place pretty well, so I'll just add in how great the prices are. I had a rib-eye steak sandwich, iced tea, and a mocha milkshake for about $13. I could not eat another bite the rest of that Saturday Night, phenomenal. The ambiance is also great, the building feels very \"homey\" with all the wood paneling and old-school wallpaper.SO,go, eat, and drink milkshakes: for places such as the Courier are getting harder and harder to find!",

Our party of 5 was placed at a table by the front window, which was so cold, being next to the door. Not to difficult to crank up the heat to compensate!Our order consisted of 2 burgers, Broiled pork tenderloin, fish tacos, and white meat fried chicken.The courier burger was alright, but not really anything phenomenal. My mother had the broiled pork tenderloin, which I tasted and it had a good flavor to it. My wife had the fish tacos, which she liked. My sister ordered the fried chicken but she said it was nothing special and she could do better at home. The time spent waiting for our food was pretty unreasonable. More than a half hour spent waiting on food to arrive to our table, which feels much longer when you are freezing cold(we kept our coats on and were still cold).The fried chicken apparently was the item that held up our table. You would think with the amount of time they took, they would have gotten it right, but you would be wrong. It was supposed to be all white meat, but instead was a breast, thigh, and leg. The waitress said they must have mixed them up in the back. We took this as \"I grabbed the wrong plate\" but after another 5-10 minutes she hadn't come back. When she finally did come back, there was no offer to get what was ordered, but instead she offered to take a cheeseburger off our bill.So rather than make it right, we got \"go ahead and eat the thing ya didn't want, and we'll comp the cheeseburger your son ordered.\"My sister started to eat the breast and on the 2nd bite almost puked right there at the table as she had bitten into a long black hair that was laced into the batter.At that point we alerted our waitress. The manager came over and said he would make the chicken dinner free and put the cheeseburger back on our bill.\"Damn right you'll make it free, she had two bites and refuses to eat it!\"So she had essentially no dinner and was not offered anything else except a free desert. It's been about 10 years since I'd been to the Courier and I don't think I'll ever be going back again. We really should have waited in line for some of the amazing BBQ on the next street over.If ya don't mind freezing, waiting forever for your food, getting the wrong order, and then finding hair in it... Yea, go try Courier Cafe",

We pointed this out to the staff and later someone came by and took it out of our way.  Several minutes later another waitress  approached our  table, interrupted boyfriend and me mid conversation and accused us of taking \"her money\". Later she was hanging out by the cash register area counting all of her singles proudly with no regard to other customers waiting to be served. I found this beyond rude... the staff needs to learn to work together more and communicate  better, and they need to hire employees  that can at least pretend that they like their job, not just the money. Food was good, but I was too  frustrated  by this  experience  to enjoy  it for all that it had the potential  to be.",

It has never been so bad. The only reason why we placed 2 stars is because of the food.-(Money-saving Mystery Butter blend) On numerous occasions when we dined here, we had a very hard time getting an order in. When ordering a plate, the waitress was cold and stern. We asked her to bring plain butter rather than their money-saving \"mystery butter blend\", and she was making a face and saying \"Oh I'm not sure I can do that\", despite the fact that they have pure butter at hand. She was selective about who she served and was overall rude.-(Kicking customers out the door) Then Chuck, the manager, and his waitress came up to our table well before closing hour and started moaning about how he is closing soon and was trying to kick us out in advance!-(Ignoring customers) The last time we came here, we sat outside as the waitress Nicole was serving someone else. Although we said \"hi\", *she blatantly ignored us* and we had to walk into the restaurant and talk to the manager JUST TO PLACE OUR ORDER. It was so bad. We watched the manager baby-sit the waitress as he told her \"you have customers waiting for you, Nicole.\"But she had seen us before and consciously ignored us.A few minutes after we came back out to dine outside, Nicole (the waitress) walked towards us and gave us a very phony smile. -(Insolent manager) On this other occasion, Chuck (The Manager) was chatting with us after dinner and he called my friend a \"Liar\" simply because he was trying to get him to guess where we were from. He also called us \"Disingenuous\" for the same reason.-(Summary) Overall, The Courier Cafe has great food, but due to a grumpy and harassing Manager, and rude waitresses who need to be *told* that they have tables waiting for them, we are strongly considering never dining there again.",

Our breakfasts were all very good: fresh, tasty and good portions. Nothing that makes you call it the best you ever had, but great basic food nonetheless. I'll go back for breakfast at the Courier next time I'm in town.Have to say the service was outstanding: super friendly, fast, unobtrusive.

The hostess made me wait while she tallied up a stack of paperwork --- didn't seem to bother her that I'm 5 months pregnant and would've been more comfortable seated.  After I was seated, it took the waitress 5 minutes to come over and get my order.  No hellos or how are yous..... just \"what do you want?\"  By that point, other patrons had come in and she seemed perky and friendly with them.  My food came out fairly fast, but my burger was underseasoned and overcooked.  At that point I just wanted to get out.  So I had to flag my now-chatty waitress who was paying attention to every other table and asked for my check, which she just slammed down on my table.   I didn't even bother leaving a tip nor will I ever return again.",

The Dagwood is especially good and the milkshakes are yummy.  The salad bar offers a nice selection as well.Definitely beats all the \"chain\" restaurants in town.",

The decor has literally not changed in decades, and suits it well.For this visit, the wife and I ate small. She had a quesadilla with sweet potato fries (chips, actually) and I had the potato skins along with a ham and cheese.Funny thing about their sandwiches. The inside is warm, but the bread is soft, not toasted. That was strange. The potato skins have changed, and I think this must depend on who is cooking. I didn't like these as much as the old ones. The old version was literally potato \"boats\". The new version are more like fries. I was told the quesadilla was only fair, not great. I ordered the phosphate as always, and it was a little bland.Maybe they need to up the quality of their food again. I wouldn't rush to go back as I always have.",

(you know... the stuff you usually rinse off thoroughly.)the service is generally fantastic.  a lot of their wait staff is attentive and friendly, especially in the morning.  there are some night staff that seem to forget you exist, but for the most part, it's decent service.  all in all, if your vegetarian or vegan, there are options, which is difficult to find for a sit down meal in this town and don't feel like having sushi or lo mein.  i would give it 4/5 but just because the quality of some things ... like service and salad bar... is hit or miss.",

It was a splurge for me then, though I'm sure that the prices were as low as they are today. Now, it was time to bring my niece here, the night before she registered for her classes and we took a tour of my old abode, Allen Hall, which is now her casa for the next year.  And I guess it was our lucky day: I tried the coin-op crane and scooped up a prize, she got to chew the gummy fruits of my lucky labor. I had the quesadilla, which was large and tasty. Don't expect it to have the authenticity of Mxico; I wouldn't expect it to in a place so resplendent in Americana. But the American adaptation was a treat.Near a campus that has changed from mom & pop restaurants, it's very much worth the trek to get some home-style cooking in a historic, small business.",

Sunday morning brunch after V-day with the boy seemed like a good option. It was pretty hoppin and the inside was just what I expected it to be: very cute and eclectic, smattered with antiques (but not in the Cracker Barrel way.. in the authentic way), and cozy. Because the menus on the website don't say when breakfast ends and lunch begins, we weren't sure if we would have the option of choosing from either menu. We got there at around 11:35, and the hostess gave us menus with just breakfast. The menus are large, so if you take a while to decide (especially during brunch time...) be careful. Our waitress stopped by once immediately after we were seated to get our drink orders, and once about five minutes later. We told her we needed a few minutes. She came back shortly after and snapped at us, saying that they were only serving breakfast for 5 more minutes so we needed to order then. This was at around 11:45. I understand wanting to expedite things, but if the switch was happening at 11:50 shortly after we arrived, I think we should have been told by the waitress or the hostess that lunch was about to start (after we had been seated I saw people ahead of us getting salads and soups, but no lunch option was given to us). Anyway, he got the breakfast burrito and I got the breakfast sandwich. His was very good and enormous! The salsa verde was perfect.. I didn't even know I liked salsa on eggs. I think I just misordered in my haste. The croissant was not from their bakery.. it had the \"I came out of a cellophane wrapped plastic container from Sam's\" taste, but it was large.. just not a real croissant. The eggs were another problem: they were a consistent yellow color and had rounded borders. Not real scrambled eggs.. or maybe real but reconstituted. The bacon was tasty, the hashbrowns mushy. Not worth $7. He gave me half of his burrito in exchange for half of mine. I greatly benefited from the unfair trade! I really want to like this place, so I'll try it again in the next few weeks! Hopefully I'll get a smiley waitress. FYI: prices are a little higher than those listed on the online menu (but only about 50-60 cents).",

We ordered the brownie special. Indeed, that brownie now has a special place in my heart. The brownie special can be enjoyed by two-three people.

We were in for breakfast this morning...I was told to go early or wait, and I'm glad we arrived before 8 am, as there was a line when we left an hour later. Service here is cheerful, friendly and professional, and both the hostess and waitress greeted us when we entered. We skipped the homemade pastries and muffins, as they're not on the diet right now, but they looked great. I had an omelet with spinach, mushrooms and cheddar and it was very good, with very fresh veggies. The hash browns they serve are delicious...crispy without and fluffy within. They make their own bread and I tried the cinnamon toast, which was a white bread that my baker husband says was brioche dough, and made for some great toast. He tried the oatmeal with fresh berries and walnuts, which was made with whole oats. The regular size is a very good sized serving of oats...you can get a half order if you're appetite is smaller. I asked of they use real butter...I'll order my toast dry before I'll eat margarine...and she assured me they do, which I greatly appreciate. Two thumbs way up for this delish breakfast. I'll be back for lunch.",

Ensconsed in an old building in downtown Urbana, Courrier Cafe is definitely a cut above the typical restaurants in U of I's hometown.  We were pleasantly surprised.  My wife had the 'Ham and Scram' and a side of pumpkin pancakes that were on special.  The eggs were well cooked and the ham was really tasty.  It had the right hint of smokines which I thought was particularly pleasant.  I had the Spanish omlette which, as usually happens in gringo joints, was billed as 'hot' by our waitress.  It was merely low-medium.  Generous shots of hot sauce kicked my dish up to the real heat level for me.  Delicious coffee and really nice bread that made excellent toast was also provided.  Attentive service (but the restaurant only had ten patrons when we were there - right at opening) so it may not be representative.Not worth a special trip to Champaign-Urbana, but if you are in town or even passing by, a slight detour to patronize it is worth it.",

I've never been ignored and always seem to have a full glass of water without even knowing they swung by.The one thing that keeps Courier from being a super 5-star is if you're seated at anything other than a booth, it seems like you're one inch away from being knocked about by any of the staff or other patrons. Don't come if you have more than four people, it'll be next to impossible to keep you all together. However, I think Courier's still a great cozy place to get your grub on.",

Old fashioned soda fountain favorites like phosphates and malt shakes make this place unique, but nearly everything is good. Sandwiches are on fresh bread,  and burgers are thick and hearty. There are a lot of vegetarian options- my favorite is the pesto grilled swiss on sourdough. I also love the ham melt on a fresh croissant. For dessert I recommend sharing a headliner, a monstrously delicious sundae drenched in hot fudge.For the quality of food you get, this place is actually a bargain. I'd prefer it over most of CU's \"fine dining\" establishments any day. Service can be slightly slow, but overall this is one of my favorite places to enjoy after a difficult test or a arduous paper-writing spree.",

The burgers are classic - simple, no frills, good meat, fresh toppings, cooked to perfection. I'd also highly recommend the brunch menu here. Alas, it was a rare occasion that I would be awake for it but you can learn from my mistakes and get yourself some delicious brunch at Courier.For such a historic building, Courier Cafe has done a great job of preserving the past and giving people a taste of the olden times.",

We have been to the Courier so many times over the years that we don't even need menus anymore. We were greeted as soon as we entered and noticed the restaurant was really clean. No tables with empty plates or spilled food under the tables. We were seated, given menus and glasses of ice water. We ordered our usual meals, my wife had a turkey croissant sandwich with french fries and I had a dagwood sandwich on white bread. We shared an order of potato skins which they call \"Skinny Dippers Deep\" which are fried potato skins covered with cheese, bacon, sour cream, and chives. They were awesome and filling, even with two people sharing the skinny dippers, we didn't really have that much room left for our sandwiches. My wife ate half of her sandwich and took the rest of it home. I took my whole sandwich home and had it for dinner. Was looking forward to getting a peanut butter cookie from the case near the register, but they were sold out. Their peanut butter cookies are about the size of your whole hand. All in all, they had a clean restaurant, fast & friendly staff, and great food, what else can you ask for?",

The food is American: sandwiches, burgers, soups, salads, and also more serious entrees. I was going to go for the salmon, but my waitress talked me out of it, so I ended up getting the pork chops, which came with soup. The soup was black bean soup: it was actually quite tasty, and the portion was huge (I expected just a small bowl, since it was supposed to be a side). I was almost full after finishing the soup and when the pork chops arrived, and that was a good thing because I was not too impressed by them... grilled pork chops lathered in bbq sauce, really nothing too exceptional, and the little side of salad that came with it didn't even have any dressing. So... the portion were huge, it was pretty cheap (I think I ended up paying under $15 including a soda), but the food did not impress me much. The service however was pretty friendly. I tried going again for brunch on a Sunday morning, but gave up when I saw the line... I guess it gets quite crowded on the weekend, which is generally a good sign, so I'll have to give it another try for brunch.",

The roasted corn and poblano chowder was absolutely delicious.  I wanted to stop by the nearest U of I frat house and borrow a beer bong to take down a vat of this soup--yea, it was that good!

                "review": "The other night, my girlfriend and I went out to the Courier Cafe in downtown Urbana. Having been there before, I knew that it was a good place to go for a relatively cheap meal (which is why I capitulated rather quickly). Courier Cafe is one of the older restaurants in downtown Urbana, having been open since 1980. As such, it has outlasted many other downtown Urbana businesses, and enshrined their memory in the names of its burgers.Speaking of burgers, they are the primary reason I go to the Courier Cafe. Burgers are around $5-6, and are 1/3 of a pound. The burgers also tend to be higher quality than the standard pub fare, considering people go there for food, instead of ordering a burger as an afterthought.On this night I opted for the Darcy's burger, which is a burger with mushrooms and bleu cheese. The burger comes on a plate with all of the other assorted toppings, including onions, tomatoes, lettuce, and pickles, off to the side, so you can add them to taste. The burger comes well done unless you specify otherwise. The meat itself is relatively juicy for being a grilled burger, and the bun tastes more like it came from a genuine bakery, instead of a store-brand 8 pack of buns, which often ends up being the case in burger restaurants.Another thing Courier is known for is its old-style sweet drinks, such as its phosphates and New York egg creme drinks. These are sugary soda-type drinks with flavored syrup, with the egg creme being a phosphate with an egg cracked into it and creme added. Courier also has a variety of ice cream desserts.Courier's wine and beer menu is not very extensive, but they have had Rogue Dead Guy on draft for $4 the last few times I have gone, which is cheaper than most bars in the area. In addition, their bottled beers are relatively cheap, and the wine by the glass is inexpensive as well. Though the menu is not extensive, there is a good enough variety to please most individuals.For two people with burgers, drinks, and one order of fries, the total bill ended up being $18.84. This is much lower than one would pay for an equivalent meal anywhere else, even a place like Murphy's (which has a similar food menu, though lower quality food). Courier is a perfect spot for a cheap date, where your date won't know you're being cheap unless you let her see the check.",

For those of you that aren't familiar, the chocolate egg cream, originating in New York (as far as I've heard), contains milk (not cream), chocolate syrup, and seltzer. That's right, no egg. The egg creams at Courier are delicious, however, you should all know, they are NOT authentic egg creams as they contain egg whites to help the top foam up. At any rate, very few places these days have egg creams, so it's great that this place still does. (But if nowhere near you has them and you want to try, they're way easy to make. My version: Fill a glass 1/3 with milk, add syrup til liquid height is 1/2 up the class, fill the rest of the way with seltzer, stir, taste, add more syrup if you wish!)",

But there's nothing like a good old fashioned milkshake that's too think to get through a straw, and comes with the overflow in the metal mixing cup. Even on a cold winter day, I'll make my way over to the Courier Cafe. Any self-respecting milkshake connoisseur might do the same.",

He took it back to the kitchen and when he came back, told me that they were out of the bread I ordered.  Ok...so why didn't someone come out and ask me what I wanted instead, rather than just making it with something else and hoping I wouldn't notice?  Seems pretty straightforward.  I got a new sandwich and by that time my boyfriend was almost done eating.After that, our waiter never bothered even stopping by our table again to check in, other than walking by to drop off the check.Sandwich was good (...the second one, sans hair) although the \"special sauce\" appeared to just be a mustard...maybe they were out of that too.",

While yes the place is technically a diner, it's really the only one I've ever seen that could be said to offer some historical interest as well; as the back of the menu describes in detail, the place used to be the home of the Courier Newspaper. Much of the decor hanging on the walls has some historical significance, which was so cool! Perfect place to bring an out-of-towner.The food was really delicious. I ordered a Spanish omelette, which was HUGE and came with potatoes and a choice of homemade bread (I chose sourdough bread). The potatoes came diced, and were fried slightly soft--almost like very very tender McDonalds hashbrowns. Not my preferred breakfast potato style, but I'll take it!! The omelette was my favorite part--stuffed with fresh jalapenos, onions, chorizo, and Chihuaha cheese. And so cheap, too! 8-ish bucks for a very generous meal.But the best part of the meal: the truly great service (particularly in contrast to the brunch experience I had had just the day before elsewhere, in Champaign). I don't remember her name, but our waitress just beamed amiable Midwest charm, and was very competent about getting us refills and keeping us apprised of the status of our dishes when there was a bit of a wait to get our food. My friend who brought us to this place has stories of how this same waitress would bring her hot tea with lemon when she was feeling ill.I believe it. And I'd gladly come back next time.",

By the end I just felt like I was eating a mush of sugar. To counteract this sugar, I also ordered from the salad bar. I liked the layout of the Salad Bar - you pay $0.38 per oz of salad you get, so I had a filling salad to go with my sweet sandwich for only $2.50! Not a very diverse salad bar, but I was fairly pleased.The other members of my party enjoyed their meal just fine, but we didn't feel this was anything special. The decor of the restaurant is very vintage, so it ;s kind of dark and has a different feel to it. After reading the reviews, I'm bummed I didn't order a milkshake!

Given the lack of customers, service was pretty slow. There were only a few menus for us to look at, and the ones that we got were covered with crayon and torn-- but the waitress was nice.My friends got the gazpacho but they said that it was fermented (i.e.,  old). I tried it and thought the same, WTH? I got the Courier burger-- simple bacon cheeseburger with fries. The burger was huge but it was extremely dry like sandpaper. I hate putting ketchup and mustard on a  burger, but I had to just to get the moisture back in my mouth! The fries are NOT fries, they're potato wedges. Have you ever been to Mcdonalds? Fries should look and taste like that. Com'on.I then got The Headliner (two scoops of ice cream with fudge, peanuts, whip cream and a cherry). It was okay, but nothing spectacular-- Joe Schmo who lives out in the dumpster could've made it...probably faster too. Given that we were one of the few groups in the restaurant, it took way too long to make it. Courier Cafe is overrated.",

For lunch and dinner, we usually have sandwiches -- the Carolina Reuben is incredible, and the food is very reasonably priced. The salad bar is always a hit -- a great inexpensive way to get some extra veggies.For dessert, you can't go wrong with a milkshake, a sundae (Misprint with hot fudge!) or a slice of pie (cherry pie  la mode!). Courier is an Urbana tradition for a good reason, and has never disappointed.",

Let me say that neither was really that good, especially the pesto pita.  The presentations of the food left something to be desired. The one thing that was tasty on the menu was the chocolate peanut butter shake. Not sure if a shake really has the ability to bring me back to a restaurant, and in this case it doesn't.

I asked her to investigate some places we could get brunch, and she found Courier Cafe.  She said one of her girlfriends said it was really good.So, we got there and put our name in.  The restaurant is small, but homey, lots of antiques, reminded me of being at my grandma's old house.  We waited for maybe 20 minutes for a table.When we sat, we were given lunch menus.  When I inquired as to if they were still serving breakfast, one person said \"I don't know, let me check,\" one said \"no\" and the hostess came over and explained that we would've had to have been there by 11:45 to get on the \"breakfast waiting list.\"  It would've been nice if someone explained this to us when we got there, because 2 of the 3 of us REALLY wanted breakfast, and came to find it unavailable.  I was really disappointed.  I love breakfast.  I almost cried, legitimately.I digress.  There were plenty of tasty looking things on the menu, and I liked that all of their breads are made in-house.  Everyone enjoyed what they had.  My sister had the turkey croissant, and my boyfriend had the turkey club with a cup of chili.I had the Courier burger, which came with thick sliced bacon and cheddar cheese.  I could tell right away this burger was going to be delicious.  It was cooked on a flat-top griddle, which imparts such good flavor.  The patty was perfectly seasoned, and the cheese and bacon were just right. I didn't add ANY condiments or garnishes to the burger, just ate it as is.  The bun was a perfect brioche-y, eggy delight.Lunch for three came to $33.00.  I will certainly return the next time I am in Champaign, and try to get there early enough for breakfast.",

I ignored my intuition that this place is probably only suited for breakfasts.  There were limited items on the menu that were healthy.  I ordered the soup and sandwich combo.  I had black bean soup, which was pretty tasteless, and the chicken salad sandwich, which was unremarkable and doused in too much mayo.The worst part is my dining companion got the special, a chicken fajita bowl.  Now, let's grant that you probably shouldn't expect excellent Tex Mex in a joint with antiques and an Americana vibe.  But, he took the plunge.  He sincerely regrets this, as he was rendered useless after eating the bland \"fajita bowl\", which was more like chicken salad with jarred salsa in a taco bowl.  By useless, I mean he must have gotten an extreme case of food poisoning because he spent the entire remainder of the day making multiple trips to the men's room.After an experience with the food here that left us sick, I wouldn't come back.  There are much better places to grab a bite in downtown Urbana.",

I know you have friendly and skilled servers that have been happily working there for years who ask if you want separate checks before you even order.  I know your food is delicious and eclectic with your amazing, packed salad bar and uniquely named menu items like the Monkey Stuff sandwich with bananas, peanut butter, shredded coconut and honey; or your Rancheros Rarebit, the over-stuffed breakfast burrito doused in red sauce; or even simply, the Paperboy, Courier or Morning Edition breakfasts of eggs, toast, hash browns and choices of meats and fixin's.   You carry baked goods like powdered-sugar-topped brownies, gigantic cookies and breads such as the \"Bubby Bun\" -- I know this.  I know that you can make me a super sundae loaded with nuts and fruity goodies, or a Green River Phosphate with whipped cream foaming over the side of my frosty mug.  I know that you have a different flavored coffee offered every day of the week in addition to your regular and decaf, and I know that you sell bags of each flavor so that we may enjoy them at home any time we want.I know all of these things....So, why is it that every time I think of you and your wonderful establishment (you won't be leaving us any time soon, I am sure), the one thing that comes to mind again and again......is your hand-dipped, peanut butter shake.  Sometimes I wonder if I should have malt or chocolate added to compliment the peanut butter, but I always go back to just plain peanut butter.  I don't even care if you forget the whipped cream (although, you never do).  Just give me the peanut butter blended smoothly into the vanilla ice cream, in a frosty mug or a foam to-go cup and I am elated.  I will wait and wait how ever long it takes (because I know people line up to partake of your fabulous fare) just to take that first, satisfying sipand slip into a frosty bit of heaven.  And thank you, thank you for always making a little too much so that you have to bring out the metal shaker with the extra shake bits for sharing with my friends.  Because you know it's very difficult to want to share this with anyone.There is one more thing I know.  I will always be back to visit you every time I'm in town.  Because I do.  Thank you, Courier Cafe.Love,Clarissa J.",

I ordered two eggs, sausage, potatoes, small fruit bowl and coffee. The waitress did an excellent job, looking over me just enough without being intrusive. The eggs, over easy, were too easy. The yolk was properly runny, but unfortunately so was the white. Sausages were tasty, but not seasoned enough. The hash browns were good, but could have been crisper. The English muffin that came with the meal was toasted well, but buttered too heavily. The total bill was $11.13, so plus the tip, my breakfast cost over $13.00. Next time I'll check the prices on the menu, I just assumed that they were in line with other breakfast eateries. I would give this place two stars if the service had not been excellent.",

I just want the BLT to be a great BLT. The BLT was a good BLT, but it was a $4 BLT. Tiny slice of tomato, lots of lettuce, some decent bacon, on basic slices of wheat bread. The skins were $4.95, and these are SO worth it to split with a group, because of how good they are and how many we received. Milkshake was $3.75, I believe. Altogether, Mr. Boyfriend spent around $30 before tip for the two of us. -Timing: We arrived at 12:10, ordered by 12:15, and were served at 12:45. I had to be back at work by 1, so I had hoped the food would come out more quickly. This isn't a terrible wait, and like I said, the restaurant was doing good business. Still, I had ten minutes to eat, but 30 to talk. I would rather have 30 minutes to savor those potato skins, and ten minutes to talk to the jerks I call friends, but you can't always get what you want.",

We're always on the lookout for new places to eat, non-chain if possible, and I'm so glad I found all the nice reviews about Courier Cafe on Yelp beforehand.  We had a wonderful lunch visit!  I loved the old-time atmosphere and I didn't catch our waitresses name but she was without a doubt the most friendly I've had in a very long time.  We made it a little before the lunch crowd and I'm glad we did because they were packed!  Expect a bit of a wait at peak times, as the seating is limited.I had the Tuna Melt with onion rings and I have to say the food was delicious!  I also highly recommend the sweet potato chips and milk shakes...awesome!  We'll definitely be making it back here in the future, as I loved everything about Courier Cafe!",

I can't complain though because I saved the other half of the sandwich for dinner since the portions were pretty big. My brother went to the salad bar and it's only 32 cents per ounce, so his whole plate was less than $5! That was pretty awesome.",

The Banker's Burger is fantastic, the Monkey Stuff sandwich sounds weird, but is amazing. Some of the sandwiches are obscene in their size. Asking for a side of mayo is a mistake as they will bring you a 1/4 of mayo. The sweet potato chips are delicious. They also have a salad bar that has a decent selection.But ignore all of what I said above because none of it matters. Even if Courier had the worst lunch and breakfast food on earth, I'd still go for the shakes. Oh my god the shakes. I get the shakes thinking about their shakes. Feeling like a high roller? Order the apple pie shake. Some of the waitresses will not know what you are talking about, but once you explain it to them, they will make it. Piece of apple pie + ice cream + blender = apple pie shake. They will charge you for both a slice of pie and a shake, and it is worth every penny. Great to take your date who isn't watching her figure (or is way too damn skinny and needs to bulk up a bit). Seriously, stop reading and go get an apple pie shake!",

OMG, the bread was to die for! Husband ordered basted eggs, bacon, and rye toast. We considered the hash browns -- they smelled wonderful in the kitchen -- but are trying to watch our waistlines, so passed on potatoes this trip. They were working on setting up the lunch salad bar (it was about 10:30 when we got there) and it looked fresh and delicious.

Additionally the courier offers a wide array of milkshakes and ice creams. I ordered a cherry cola phosphate and it was sweet and delicious. I'm giving them 5 stars despite the fact that the boy working the front was a little standoffish it's okay he's probably in highschool I'm sure he will learn manners as he grows. I will surely return to this wonderful establishment.",

A big breakfast is always a good way to kick off a day.I picked up a Denver Omelette with hash browns -- as much as I wanted to try the Spanish Omelette with chorizo, something about tequila in my eggs didn't really sound quite right. It was good. The omelettes here aren't mile-high and fluffy; they're more traditional omelettes, but still made with fresh ingredients.The hash browns were pretty good. Both maybe could have used a little more seasoning, but I was satisfied with both items.Now, the almond french toast -- if you like your french toast sweet, this is the item for you. The batter was spiked with serious amount of almond extract, and once you pour maple syrup over it... watch out! Still, it was very good. What few sips I had of the New York Egg Cream were also quite good. The chocolate flavor was pretty good (perhaps not as dark as I prefer, but... I have no idea what a New York Egg Cream is supposed to taste like) and also very sweet.For a basic breakfast, I wasn't blown away, but I would definitely go back to Courier Cafe for a good breakfast the next time I visit Urbana.",

My burger reminded me of a day at the park where you buy frozen burger patties from Costco and throw em on the grill. Where's In-and-Out when I need them? They also wouldn't cook my french fries extra crispy for some reason which was also another negative. The highlight was probably the hot fudge sundae but as a reminder, unless you like eating dessert as dinner, share that sucker with someone. I'd go here again if I wanted something super casual and laid back. But since I usually travel here with a band wagon of people, I'll have to take them elsewhere.",

You must come here for their homemade ice cream that they use for delicious shakes and the highly recommended sundaes (see picture).As for the regular food, 3 stars in quality, 2 stars for how I wish fries came with my meal.  I had the turkey croissant, which was good but gave me a vibe of how I could have made it at home.  I do not like how fries are not automatically included with sandwiches (see picture).  However, my boyfriend seemed to really enjoy his Southern Fried Chicken.  The Skinny Dippers were to die for, literally, there's sour cream, bacon and cheese on them!The ambiance is great and classic.  They have an ample number of wooden booths and a beautiful copper ceiling.  The menu looks like it came from a printing press used to advertise the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, for which I believe they have pictures of on the walls.I would recommend Courier Caf as great place to top off a dinner date meal, take your family, or catch up with friends.  During nice weather they have outdoor seating.",

My friend got the Buenos Dias burrito and a glass of milk.We both thought our meals were delicious. I particularly liked the fresh croissant that was the bread of my sandwich. The hash browns had a good balance of dryness and wetness, which I feel can be easy to goof up and make them too dry or wet sometimes. These were done right.Our server was pleasant but really busy. My only issue was with the coffee, I feel like it took way to long to come out. I'm a bit of a coffee fiend and especially when I have a hangover I want that stuff ASAP!Prices were fair and the food was great.

I always appreciate restaurants that offer vegan or vegetarian choices.  I was able to get \"The Courier Breakfast\" (2 eggs, bacon, ham, or sausage, served with hash browns and your choice of toast) with vegetarian sausage patties.  My eggs over easy and German Rye toast blended well with the patties, and the hash browns were perfectly browned.  Add a small grapefruit juice, and bottomless coffee and my meal was just what I wanted.  I wanted the Almond French Toast too, but had to pick only one meal.  I'm not in the area often, but I would definitely come back.  I loved their selection of kids's book (see photo) if you have a child that needs occupied at the table.  There is also plenty of parking, both in the lots next to it, and across the street.",

The menu looks like it has appetizing, if plain, selections, but the food doesn't taste like anything and there's so much of it on the plate that after a while you begin to feel as though you are in a fight to the death with it.  I've heard people say that it's diner food, but it tastes more like reheated frozen dinners. It looks like food, and sometimes it smells like food, but inexplicably, it doesn't taste like food. The service is serviceable. The bathrooms are appalling.  The salad bar is puzzling.  The four times I've been there, I've found it rather difficult to get cashed out.

Eggs were cooked perfectly, toast was brown and buttery, potatoes were addicting, and bacon was crisp.  Problem with that?  No.  It's nothing immensely creative or surprising, but I got exactly what I wanted and I enjoyed the atmosphere at the same time.  I'd always come back here for brunch.",

Have been on a super-awesome-diet for a bit, now, though, so instead of my usual (the bacon cheeseburger (and even _I_ can't believe I found the strength not to order that one!!)), I decided upon a healthier option-- the trout with a visit to the salad bar.Disappointment, upon disappointment for this poor meal.  The trout was cooked in what was supposed to be a lemon-like sauce.  Now, normally, if I've had trout, it's either cooked crispy in the skin, or filleted out of the skin, and cooked in the sauce.  Not for this unfortunate creature.What I got was a piece of trout cooked in the skin, but steeped in the sauce, so much so that the skin had become rubbery and chewy.  The \"lemon\" flavor was so absent, that all I was left with was an incredibly FISHY piece of fish (which is never really a plus for me), in a gelatinous, plasticy skin.  I did my best with it, but it was a disappointment.  I have to expect that Courier has cooked harder dishes (with Silvercreek in the family!!), so... I don't think it was out of the realm to imagine they'd do a good piece of fish! The rest of the table was pretty happy, though.  My trip to the salad bar was less disappointing, but wilted lettuce, and the inability to get to the items I wanted on the bar (most of the healthy options are waaaaaaay toooooo farrrrr in the back, and grossly out of reach from the average grabber) made the salad blucky, too!

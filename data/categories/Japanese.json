At first, I was a bit suspect based on what others have told me and having eaten at places in chicago, but I was pleasantly surprised! They have a large variety of sushi from spider rolls to something called a spicy tuna pizza, which is a rice patty tempura with spice tuna and spicy mayo on top. They should really add to the appetizer portion of the all-u-can-eat menu though. The only thing that really irks me about this place is that they raised the prices by like $8 within a year! WHO DOES THAT!??! Thank the lord my friends have coupons so we were able to still get the deal for a decent price. Overall, the all-u-can-eat deal is good, but only if you have those coups, lol.",

I had the shrimp tempura roll and an eel roll, so I can't really comment on the quality of the fish, but what I had seemed to be of decent quality.  Oddly the sushi combo came with an egg roll which decent as well.  If I feel like eating some sushi this place would suffice without breaking the bank.",

The only reason I gave this place a shot after experiencing their sloppy food is because it's so close to engineering campus.A word of caution for those who care:None of the non-sushi items are vegetarian it turns out. Before I order something, I usually make a point to double-check. When I asked about the 'vegetable teriyaki', the guy rudely said 'that's why it says vegetable'.When I received my plate after his reassurance, I noticed some meat in the dish. I took the thing back to him, and he refused to talk to me because he said 'I wasn't a customer'! What?! I lost it when he told me to get out of the line.Bottom line is that place has bad service, is extremely inhospitable, and is not suitable for vegetarians. Furthermore, after the owner had to get involved, I learned that the all sauces/broths have some chicken in them. I can understand when someone makes a mistake. I hate when people who cannot admit it when it happens and make no attempt to rectify the situation afterwards.",

The menu is huge, definitely biased toward sushi and sushi rolls, but contains other things like rice porridge, teriyaki, or noodle soup. I had a sushi roll, which was, expectedly, pricey and did not fill me up, but the following time I enjoyed a very agreeable bowl of vegetable congee. I'm usually wary of places that try to cook such a huge menu of foods, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that they are doing a pretty ok job of it.  Definitely stop by, at least once, it's worth a look.",

I always get one of the 2 or 3 roll sushi specials that come with an egg roll which are $7 for 2 rolls or $9 for 3 rolls for lunch and then $1 more at dinner time. They have the popular sushi rolls you would get in your average Japanese restaurant but a few special rolls as well. It has a sort of fast food feel to it because you order at the counter but the taste is better than any of the other sit down sushi restaurants on campus.I get the take out quite often and they are VERY quick and always do a good job of packing enough condiments. I will definitely be eating here several times a week during the school semester - it has become one of my favorite campus restaurants since it's opening.",

Nor is it a sushi restaurant with great variety of rolls. The quality is decent enough, the rolls large, and the meal filling. We ordered 6 different types of rolls (a lot of food -- we were not able to finish), all roughly $5-6 each, and all tasted about the same. Many of the rolls come stuffed with cream cheese. The main flavor difference between them was whether a fried ingredient was also included. Vegetables, too, added a little variation -- the asparagus offered texture. Many of the rolls promise \"crab,\" but the cashier told me that the rolls include imitation crab meat. The seaweed salad had a tasty sesame oil dressing. It made a nice contrast as a side. Two of us shared one portion (priced around $6).The free fried eggroll, a small complementary item, that came with our rolls was not very good. It was room temperature and oily.The restaurant is clean, but extremely plain and spare.",

I tried their yakisoba and as far as cheap Asian-y takeout-y noodles go, I can't believe I'm saying this, Chopstix does it better. It's edible though so whatever. Lol.Their sushi rolls were a huge disappointment :c. I got the Palatine Roll. First thing I noticed: they don't know how to roll their rolls. Everything was loose and falling apart. The rice wasn't packed well and it just looked like some amateur rolled it in the dark. With no hands.Second, the pieces of fish were miserly thin. I've only had thinner pieces at My Thai, which is the worst restaurant that I've ever been to in my life (Not just sushi restaurants. I'm talking out of ALL restaurants). Most of the roll was rice or veggies (not even the avocado kind of veggie). Sushi Ichiban engages in the practice of using rice as one of their fillings for an inside-out roll. That means that the rolls are double-stuffed with rice, which I hate because they're cheaping out on you and trying to make it seem like it's all cool. It left me feeling played like they didn't even try. I've been to plenty of cheap ass sushi places that do not double stuff.The only positive is that it tasted pretty good. I've had some awful sushi and this sushi is not at that level. It's pretty yummy, honestly. But... how many offensive  flavors can cheap, white rice really have...",

Instead, I was thrown off the minute I opened the bag. Instead of sushi soy sauce, it was just plain, cheap soy sauce, which is never a good omen. If you're going to name your restaurant \"Sushi... -anything-\" it's probably a good idea to actually provide the right condiments. The quality of the rolls were really poor. They were sloppy, falling apart, and some were sliced paper thin, while others were so large I couldn't even eat them without making a huge mess. The smoked salmon tasted like it had been soaked in liquid smoke instead of actually smoked. It was sour, fishy, and really terrible. The roll that was supposed to have tobikio on it had maybe 3 eggs per piece, which was terribly upsetting because it was the whole reason I'd decided on the roll.The only thing I enjoyed was the mini egg roll I received. It was hot, crispy, and quite honestly, really delicious. Maybe their regular menu is better, but I will definitely not be ordering sushi from here again.",

I sat back up after twenty minutes and found blood spewing out of my anus. As well, I started to feel something crawling up my throat. Before I knew it I was hurling throw up for minutes. Before coming to Sushi Ichiban make sure you take precautions. Make sure you have your cell phone in hand in case you have to call 911 at any given time.",

We are in the middle of nowhere - fish can't exactly be delivered and prepared on the same day, so don't go in expecting something fancy. Like its rating, it's A-OK sushi. Sushi Ichiban has a huge menu though, and they offer Chinese food along with a wide range of sides, appetizers, and drinks. You can even get packaged food to go if you're in a rush.I only go here when I feel a craving for sushi and want to go all out with the all-you-can-eat offer. It's $25/person and you get a menu to mark what you want. Then they bring out your order and when you're done, you can ask for another sheet to order more. The number of choices is quite large and chances are you'll find something you like. I enjoy the sweet potato roll, the Las Vegas roll, New York roll, and the Bubba Gump roll the most. They sometimes look good, but sometimes they look hastily made and are unevenly cut/fall apart. I also hate it when they cram the rolls full of veggies/rice and only a small bit of fish. The miso soup is okay though.Tip: The raw tuna they use sometimes tastes bad, so eat at your own risk. It's not worth getting something like the spicy tuna roll and having to eat it or pay the $1/piece left uneaten fine. My tuna roll had a strange, fishy taste and the color was a dull reddish-brown with a glossy sheen to it.Waiter service: almost non-existent. You get water by yourself (grab a pitcher if you have a big party), and the only service is when they bring you your sushi. There is one Caucasian waiter who is really nice and dedicated to good service. He jokes around, is totally friendly, and he works really hard. I dislike the Chinese waiter though because my boyfriend and I were eating together and he gave our order to another couple who didn't even look like us. He literally decided to give it to the first table of two he saw. After a long wait, I asked him about my bf's order because I overheard the couple picking at the rolls and saying they weren't sure if this was their order. He says, \"Oh, I gave it to that table.\" No apology or anything. We had to reorder and wait even longer for his order to come out. They also messed up my order and out of the three rolls I ordered, they completely forgot to give me my third one. As a poor student, I guess this is the highlight of my sushi experience when I want okay sushi, but don't want to splurge.",

The place would definitely benefit from some minor renovation...it has this almost kind of like \"Panda Express\" feel to it. I dunno, not a fan of that aspect considering it's a one-of-one as far as I know. It is what it is, but it could be nicer, hip-er even, with not a lot of effort.P.S. This is where I made my discovery that (since they are super stingy with the sweet sauce) mixing Sriracha with soy sauce is a pretty dang delicious dipping sauce for tempura. I did appreciate that they had a big bottle of hot sauce on every table.",

Oy, this better be good sushi-- and it was just okay.I got the sweet potato tempura and tuna roll. The sweet potato roll was good, though not the best I've ever tasted. I wanted more than fried tempura shrimp in rice and seaweed-- rather too simple from the others that I have tried. The tuna roll left something to be desired-- the tuna was not fresh and lacked a natural \"tuna\" taste I oh so love. Both of the rolls were sloppily made-- both of the rolls were uneven and had more stuffing in others. I like food to be quick, but I also value what I eat. Two more minutes wouldn't have killed me.The free egg roll that came with my meal was small and was seriously cold. Not worth eating. I have a few more days in Champaign, and rather than going there one more time, I will stick to Sushi Rock.",

There's only one roll I've had here which I didn't like, and that's not because it was poorly made or anything; I just didn't like the flavor (the Texas Scorpion, in case you're wondering).  I tend to prefer fancy rolls, but most of the specialty rolls here are pretty similar, and I'd prefer some variety.I always get a ton of yellowtail when I go, though.  It's pretty tasty.",

Yet among these, Kamakura is the only one where the image matches the quality of the food.For a restaurant in central Illinois, especially on a road next to the middle of nowhere, there's no need to go overboard with decor. Yet Kamakura's elegant interior stands in stark contrast to the dusty cornfields outdoors. The food is diverse for a stand-alone Japanese restaurant, and makes me wonder how many of the original ingredients were traded for easier-to-obtain substitutes. The taste, like the restaurant, is elegant in spices, to make up for the decidedly bland base.I have yet to try their sushi, or bento boxes, so I cannot review those yet.",

I had the fillet mignon, fried rice,, salad with house dressing, and miso soup.  very good choices.  I would defiantly get thier house dressing.  The show Adam puts on in front of you with fire and knives and spinning and throwing things is really cool.  on a down note, our waitress was kind of slow.  I think she might have been busy and been given too many tables.  Certainly not her fault and she tried and was pleasent, I just wish she would have came more.  Upsettingly, they were out of both kinds of draft beer and out of the first two bottles of beer that I ordered.  I can't wait to go back.  I will defiantly get the house salad dressing again, the miso soup, fried rice but I might try aa seafood next time.  If you are looking for a fun date night dinner with more than just a meal brought to your table, don't pass this place up; make reservations now.-reservations are suggested.",

We were refused service and told they were getting ready to close.  I cannot image turning away business in a poor economy.  We generally spend at lest $50.00 a person there..which I think is significant for the Champaign-Urbana market. The hostess repeatedly said, we cannot serve you because the staff would have to wait on you to finish your meal. I will never go back.  If they had been completely empty I would have had a better understanding of their position. And if they stop serving at a specific time before they close, perhaps they should turn off the 'OPEN' sign.",

Yes, I like the American version with the spicy mayo but this was far from and there was some sort of spicy-pepper mixture on top of the tiniest rolls i've ever seen. The taste was lacking and the rice seemed a bit stale.The guest I was with had a beef/veggie bowl and it was bland, served in nothing more then a standard brown gravy with little taste.

As you know, sush is all about the rice and Kamakura has the best.  The teppan is great as well.  Each chef has a unique personality and cooking style.  It makes going more often enjoyable and different everytime.  Even if you have to wait a little for a table, it's one of the best dining experience in Champaign.This is the only Japanese restaurant owned by a Japanese family.

The food itself was decent, pretty good when you take into consideration that it's sushi in Central Illinois.  The problem with this place is the service.  The place wasn't busy at all, yet our waitress seemed a bit frazzled and the service was slow.  First issue was that we weren't given any napkins and had to ask once we were served food, which to be honest isn't a big issue, but it took over 30 minutes to get a couple of sushi rolls when the place wasn't busy.  Our waitress didn't really bother to stop and ask how we were doing during our meal.  When we were done eating, our waitress asked us if we wanted some green tea, to which we accepted.  However, she left and didn't come back for about 15 minutes or so, with no tea.  At this point we decided to just ask for the check and leave, which took about another 10 minutes, although she came back with tea this time.  If you have the time, then Kamakura is a pretty good choice in terms of sushi, and I've had good experiences with their teppan in the past.",

Sometimes I'm suspicious that they must hire confederate diners to make the place look popular and lure unsuspecting customers inside.I only have one thing to say about the service here.  This is the type of place where the wait staff will judge you by your potential to tip, and then ignore you if you obviously fall into the category of \"poor college student.\"  If you come here, regardless of your background, at least dress like you own money so that you'll get your drinks refilled. On a particularly busy weekend night, I showed up with a friend and expected to wait for for a table.  Good news: we were seated immediately.  Bad news: we were seated at a teppenyaki table...when we had no intention of eating teppenyaki...and we had to share the table with a large family who we obviously did not know.  Don't get me wrong, I am not offended by cafeteria-style dining (I'm a college student, after all), but this should not be the seating arrangement at a place that presents itself as some kind of fine restaurant.  Throughout the meal, I had to whisper to my dinner companion to avoid disrupting a stranger's family dinner (awkward?).  Be careful about bringing a date here, or at least make a reservation in advance.The food?  Blegh.  Let me be clear on this--I've tasted sushi on both the east coast and west coast, and I am in no way prejudiced against eating sushi in the Midwest.  I even think there's some decent sushi in Champaign (at other restaurants), so my standards are not impossible to meet.Again, I've always eaten at Kamakura on busy nights, because I naively assumed that most sushi restaurants will bring out the best fish when serving crowds of customers.  Instead, I received garbage that smelled and tasted like rotting fish.  Maybe by the time they got to my order, they had to use the smelly leftovers at the bottom of the barrel?  When I got home, I tried to purge my mouth with Listerine.  Even with it's advertised \"deep-cleaning action,\" I couldn't get the taste of putrid fish out of my mouth.  I drank some coffee, chewed gum, etc., but there was no redemption from the haunting taste of old fish.  My suggestion?  Stick to the cooked dishes at Kamakura: tempura, teriyaki, udon, etc.With so many better sushi restaurants in the area, I don't see how Kamakura hangs onto customers.  I can forgive bad service, but food that ruins your breath for an entire day is not acceptable.  This is the kind of place that gives sushi a bad reputation.",

Upon stepping inside, however, it's like you've walked into an isolated world, and nothing in the room suggests that you're in Champaign anymore. The structure of the room, though, feels more like 1950's diner than Japanese restaurant, with a huge pit in the center of the main dining room, and booths to the side. I only caught a quick glimpse of the other side of the restaurant, but it looked a lot cozier than where we were sitting.I came on a fairly quiet Friday night, with maybe only two dozen people in the restaurant, yet the service was definitely below par. After the maitre d' seated us, nobody even came to our table until she wandered back 5 minutes later asking if anyone has showed up to serve us. The waitress was pretty inattentive also; after the appetizer, my glass of water stood empty for the rest of the meal. As for the food, I ordered a beef teriyaki bento box, which came with tempura, rice, miso soup, salad, and three pieces of nigiri sushi. The beef was cooked to perfection, and coated in a teriyaki sauce as delicious as I have ever tasted. Though we are a long way from the closest ocean, the sushi also tasted very fresh. The rest of the bento box was great, as I would expect from an established Japanese restaurant. I also ordered a separate sushi roll, containing cucumber, tempura, and spicy tuna, which was very fulfilling, albeit quite pricey. This is a very decent restaurant, but for a $50+ meal in Champaign, I would expect flawless service.",

Sure, watching the chef (with mad knife skills) flip an egg with two knives and not drop it - is pretty impressive... but as far as eating a hot meal... it is practically impossible. You have to wait for the veggies to be cooked for how many ever people are at your table & then the meat is served up last. Now you're looking at luke warm veggies with semi-warm meat.  It just takes too dang long to get the entire meal on your plate. As for table conversation, last time I was there -- we were placed next to people who had one too many drinks, who were super excited about the war in Iraq and were definitely racist as hell. Wow, get way to start & end a meal. I really considered buying a drink just to throw it at them. Either way, the food is eh for 20+ dollars. For a one time experience, I say it's worth it. But I am not all that into sitting next to strangers especially when their racist remarks make me gag.",

The food is authentic though for the most part, so I guess that's a good change from Americanized Japanese food. There was one thing I didn't like; fried salmon roll. The breading was thick and greasy. Otherwise, food was good. The whole experience was good, but there really wasn't a \"wow\" moment.",

We had a decent meal, with friendly, attentive service but I did not shake the feeling that I was not a respected patron because of the bad beginning. Our bill was over $260 that evening. (No one had anything alcoholic to drink...most drank water.) It would take 15 minutes to tidy up that \"waiting room\" if they intend to continue to use it.

After almost an hour, talking to the waiter. \"We've got management problems\" he says, like in a bad sitcom in which *we* the customers are supposed to feel sorry for *him*. More time passes by. Finally my lunch box comes in. Close to inedible. The Sarku chicken (cheap fast-food!) in Market Place Mall is many many degrees of magnitude better. How about the sushi we ask? \"Your order had a lot of complications (!). First they've burned your chicken then they've forgotten to put the crab in the sushi roll.\" No kidding? Not, apparently.After ten minutes: sorry we have to go, we said, we'll get the sushi roll (a $15 one!) to go. The waiter kind of half-apologizes and says: \"I won't charge you for the sushi.\" Probably we were way too polite, or didn't show anger or something, because when he brought the check the sushi was there included, with no explanation regarding the change of mind. We actually had to leave, I had an appointment. Friend eats sushi a little later.... there is no crab in it (15$ roll!), just the traces of the skin of the soft shell crab. (Yes, we know the delicacy that soft shell crab, properly prepared, can be.) All in all an incredibly bad experience, almost on a par with the other horror stories restaurants in Chambana - B Won and The Great Impasta.   The name and reputation of Japan, for which I have the greatest respect, don't deserve this cruel bastardization!",

They said that they can take us and we told them that we have one more friend coming.  So they sat us down and another girl came up and told us that the sushi bar already close for the night and they suppose to close in 2 minutes.  She hurried us to order from the menu and told us that the kitchen might not take anymore order if our friend did not get there in 2 minutes. (And I am not exaggerating, that was what she told us.)  I was really hungry and decided to order yakitori with yakisoba and it came with a salad and fried rice.  The food was horrible.  There was 3 sticks of skewered chicken which they tried to pass as yakitori  and cost almost $8 and the fried rice looked so horrible that I did not even touch it.  My yakisoba tasted worse than a 100 yen instant soba that I could have bought at any convenient store in Japan.  And the service was the worst thing at this place.  I am not that picky when it comes to food and especially if I am hungry, I will chow down anything.  My advice to those who are considering Kamakura, save your money, instant noodle or noodle cup taste better than the food they serve there.",

The food is delicious, and the servers are attentive: often times just an eye contact is sufficient to get them to come over immediately. The decor is OK, but the environment is pleasant and quiet: great for a quiet romantic meal. The higher prices are the only reason I did not give this restaurant 5 stars. What else can I say?

However pass it may be now, sushi had it's place 10ish years ago...), and we continued going back periodically.  Mostly for special occasions (my Prom group went here senior year), because for our standards at the time it was pricey.We still stop in most every time I visit, usually for the Teppan.  I can't tell if the chefs/waiters aren't as jazzed about their restaurant as they used to be, or if it's just my perspective that's changed.  Either way, the experience is never \"special\" like it was back in the day.Still, they do well.  I'm surprised at the negative reviews because, to be honest, Kamakura would likely earn a solid 3.5-star average where I currently hail from (LA), and I would have thought we had higher standards for cuisine -- especially of the Asian variety -- out here.   !",

I've always made reservations in advance for the teppanyaki grills, have never had to wait more than 10 minutes for a table to be cleared from an overstaying party, and have always had excellent service from both the waiters and the chefs. Every time I dine here, I order the Three Samurai meal to get chicken, steak, and shrimp. The quality of each of those is fine and I have never had a problem with steak being overcooked or chicken being undercooked. I also recommend the house dressing with the salad and a bowl of clear soup, although if you must insist on having miso you still won't go wrong. I've only ordered sushi a few times, and I never felt there was anything wrong with their sushi. I don't eat sushi often, but I definitely feel that the rest of the restaurant is their strong point.The bar inside is also well stocked and tended by someone who knows their way around drinks. The chefs are all experts in their general teppan-grill-tricks, with some learning new techniques and others inviting the guests in on some of the fun (usually breaking an egg, not throwing knives!). Reading some of the other reviews for this place, I have to wonder why people judge a restaurant based on the occupants. There is only 4 teppanyaki grills and at least 4 chefs. This is not Benihana. This is not a place for screaming children, although the restaurant should not be held responsible for a family that does not know otherwise. Sometimes if you have a very low number in your party and you choose to come on a busy weekend, you may be placed at a table with another family so that everyone can eat when they would like rather than waiting hours and being denied reservations at all for lack of grill space. Of course if you have some type of allergy to something your grill-neighbor is ordering, you should mention something so that the restaurant may make accommodations.I repeat, this is not Benihana. This is a nicer place. If you come in wearing sweats and work clothing, don't be surprised if a staff member looks at you the way you would look at someone else wearing the same outfit to a wedding. You don't have to wear the nicest of clothing, but at least don't look like you got out of bed!If food temperature is your problem, remember that they don't mind if you eat the vegetables while they're finishing cooking the meat. Your other option is undercooked meat, or overcooked vegetables, and the chefs do make sure you receive neither.",

In the lower right box (2 x2) was ONE brocille top and a half of a mini carrot!!  The rice was really sticky but my friend told me it's supposed to be that way so it sticks on the chop sticks.  I had to use a fork of course because I can't get anything to stick on chop sticks.I like the chicken teriyaki from the mall better so maybe that tells you how much I know about  Janpanese food.

Once I opened the front doors, it was like stepping into a whole new world. It was very pretty, neat, and tidy inside. I particularly liked the booths with glass tables. They have decorative cloths covering the windows that gave the place a dim, kind of romantic lighting. It complimented the shades of blues on the booths. Another cute detail was the mini Japanese statues and figurines on the wall opposite of the windows. It helped to show a little bit of culture. There were 3 different menus, one for drinks, sushi, and Teppanyaki (Hibachi) and Teriyaki dishes. Their menus were detailed which helped a lot especially on their drinks menu. I do not find too many menus that define what flavors to expect with their sakes and wines. Although I did eye the Japanese dish menus, I was set on sushi. We ended up waiting over an hour for the sushi. They were short staffed. Only one waiter was going around taking orders and delivering the food. I saw two hostesses when I walked in which was strange to me because why would they need two hostesses when they needed more waiters. Then again it is a small restaurant and the sushi had a bit of a twist.My friend got miso soup, eel roll, and tempura salmon roll. I got a spicy scallop roll, Philadelphia roll, and spicy salmon roll. The miso was a bit salty. The eel roll was tasty. The tempura salmon roll was really cute. It looked like little tofu squares. The spicy scallop roll was so spicy that it covered the taste of the Philly roll. I made a mistake by eating that first. I thought that the pieces of fish in the sushi were a good size. Also I have never seen a spicy salmon roll made the way they made it. It has a piece of salmon in the roll and then spices on the outside. To me, I like heat so this roll was not spicy enough for me. This is where the abundance of spicy sauce on the spicy scallop roll helped out. If I come back, I would try Since the prices are a bit on the expensive side, I might come back here when I'm really craving sushi or Japanese food. I did enjoy the dcor and small twists on the rolls though. I think this place is one of the better sushi places in Champaign-Urbana.",

One thing I immediately noticed is that the inside of the restaurant is so, so much nicer than the outside. I have driven past this place a hundred times and always got the impression this place was probably dingy inside. I was very wrong. Not only was the dining room very elegant and classy, but the staff were professional too. Our server made a good recommendation for my son since there was no kid's menu. We started out with an appetizer of tempura shrimp which was excellent and tasty. I had the miso soup and it was spot on - goooood. Then we had our sushi, the philly roll, alaska roll, and illini roll. Oh heavens, it was so good. The illini roll had a kick to it, quite spicy, but I love spiciness. Until now, I thought good sushi in Champaign was wishful thinking. We ended our dining experience with a bowl of green tea ice cream, so, so wonderfully delicious.",

There's also a buffet of different rolls. Those were so-so. I suppose if you ate a ton of rolls it might make up for the buffet's price. All in all, I give it a big 'meh.' It's okaaaaay.

This time, I thought everything about my dining experience was pretty bad - bad tasting food, expensive prices, and boring teppanyaki \"show\".  The sushi was terrible.  After waiting for 30 minutes (and the place was empty), my fiance's sashimi came out .  It was not worth the wait as it was super fishy tasting.  He thought that it came from the freezer, yuck.  I had a big roll, which in my opinion, was definitely not \"big\".  The only big thing on it was the many layers of tempura batter.  I felt like I was eating all breading.  I also did not like that the little bit of unagi sauce on the roll had carmelized before gettting to me, weird.  Even though the roll was half off, I felt it was over-priced for the 6 small pieces that I received.  Since we were with a large group for a friend's birthday, we also had teppanyaki.  We received salad (gross dressing!) and egg drop soup (ok).  The rice that the chef made was pretty good, though very heavy on the onions.  He also gave us a cream sauce that reminded me of honey mustard.  While I liked the sauce, I don't feel it went well with anything - maybe I could have used it on my salad to improve the taste!  The chef putting on our little \"show\" was uninteresting, awkward, and boring.  For my meal, I split the filet and shrimp with my fiance, and even the shrimp tasted too fishy.  I'm sure this is standard, but I had to pay an extra $16 to split my fiance's meal.  Everyone assured me that it was worth it because of all the food I got....hmm....I don't consider a small bowl of soup, a crappy salad , and some rice to be that much food.  Everything about the experience was negative.  I struggled with giving them one or two stars.  In the end, I went with one star because I honestly will never return there.  While I've rated other restaurants as twos, I still have hope that maybe sometime I will return and my experience and food will be better....but everything here was so overwhelmingly negative, that I really don't think I will ever go back.  Sad.",

Luckily my waiter was super accommodating and nice about it, and ended up not charging us for the entree. It was the Masaman chicken, which I had previously said was SOOOO good. Well, this time they left out nearly all of the veggies that the menu claimed that the entree had. When I pointed this out, the waiter took it back, and when it came back the second time, the only thing that was different was that there were now cashews!! Dumb!!",

Hilarious!It's wierd that I think I actually like Miko better than KoFusion, because it is more laid back, but I go to KoFusion much, much more because of the $1 sushi.  The staff at Miko has always been friendlier than at KoFusion, for whatever reason, but the bar is not as good.  Anyway, try the Dragon Roll.  Top Notch",

The sushi is entirely adequate and teh Dragon roll was indeed quite good.  There's a varied array of Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese food available, which seem delightful if not extremely special.The space is large and friendly, yet it was made much more spacious by the lack of people there on a Sunday night.  I enjoyed my chicken katsu (a bit dry, but okay overall), and sushi while taking in the slightly austere decorations (and super cool fish tank).The only thing that made it truly surreal?  The love of the cheesy movie soundtracks.  Primal Fear.  Titanic.  Star Wars. 2001.  All of the pivotal movie scores swelled serenely, lending our conversation an entirely unnecessary gravitas.  In fact, you all should try it--talking about grocery shopping is incredibly portentious when done to \"My Heart Will Go On\" or \"Flight of the Valkyries.\"One big note: Miko's price.  Thank God everything is now half price, which now means that things are *normally* priced.  Otherwise, you'd have a restaurant offering decent food for exhorbitant prices.Now, you have a restaurant that serves decent food for decent prices in a decent setting.In a word, decent.In two words, good sushi.In three words: Celine Dion sings.",

My friend ordered the Bul Go Kee (Sliced NY strip marinated in soy,garlic, and Korean spices, then charbroiled to perfection) which was seasoned really well. This came with a side of rice.I had the Ya Chae Gob-Dol (Rice with assorted vegetables and steamed tofu in a hot stoneware bowl. Stir it up with hot sauce, served on the side.) I had cellophane noodles instead of the rice.This was a pretty funny story. At first I asked our waiter if I could have noodles instead of rice. He veeeeery hesitantly said...\"Welllll I don't know...I'll have to ask the chef...\" We couldn't understand why they couldn't just put noodles on the bottom instead of rice. The guy was hilarious though. He was so awkward about it, but in a cute weird way, not a mean \"I don't want to do it for you way.\" It turns out that because the pot is so hot, he didn't know how the noodles would hold up to the stone pot. The chef said they could do it so I was happy :)The service was okay. There was only one guy working. He was nice though. Didn't refill my water though.",

I can assure you though that my opinion about the food is unbiased.I've gone to Miko twice now for their lunch buffet, and really like their offerings. They have sushi rolls (some raw and some fried), seaweed salad, miso soup, spicy soup, chap chae, sugar donuts, orange slices, salad with an Asian-style dressing, a really good sweet chicken akin to sweet and sour chicken, and either seafood, pork or chicken kalbi...all for under $14! The buffet runs from Monday through Saturday between 11:30 am - 2 pm. I particularly crave their chap chae.They also do teppanyaki for weekday dinner, Saturday dinner and all of Sunday. I will have to go back for that.",

First (and this is kind of a silly compliment), I was impressed by their spicy tuna roll.  Most places use older, leftover pieces of fish to make spicy rolls, hoping that diners will overlook the borderline-spoiled fish once its been finely chopped and masked with mayonnaise and chili.  Compare that shady technique with the way it's done at Sushi Kame, where the chef applies the spicy sauce alongside WHOLE slices of tuna (not that minced stuff).  You can still appreciate the freshness of the fish without having it saturated in a misleading sauce.  As far as I'm concerned, the spicy rolls at Sushi Kame are totally legitimate.As usual, I was also delightfully surprised by some of the offerings on their \"daily specials\" menu.  For my appetizer, I asked for the takoyaki (a regional specialty from Osaka that consists of octopus encased in pan-fried bread).  This made me giddy with foodie glee--this dish is relatively rare in the United States, and much more so in the Midwest.  The takoyaki came topped with a classic Otafuku sauce and katsuobushi shavings (dried bonito flakes).  While not perfect, I give Sushi Kame props for serving a Japanese street dish and some delicacies beyond the usual expected fare at Japanese restaurants.Unfortunately, I don't think they offer the daily specials menu everyday (ironic?).  I think it's only available on certain nights during the week, but if you happen to receive that small, hand-written insert in your menu, I would definitely give some of their other dishes consideration.",

It is more representative of the restaurants in Japan than the many Japanese, fusion, buffet, what-have-you type of setting which has become the norm now. The sushi was well made, with quality ingredients. Efficient and courteous service. And since is is off the main strip, there is almost never a wait. Would recommend this over any other sushi place in the area.",

                "review": "Came here on a whim while in downtown Champaign with my girlfriend. I saw the yelp rating before and decided that it was worth a shot. Boy was I wrong.It started off bad, we waited at the front for a while before being seated, then waited... and waited... and after maybe 20 minutes we were given our menus. After ordering a bento box, a bowl of yaki soba, and a small appetizer, we started our next wait. After an outrageous 30 minutes, our appetizer came out, tasted alright, but the 30 minute wait for that was not acceptable. (it was the korokke, I can't imagine that taking very long to make). Then we waited another 30 minutes for our main course. I had to ask the staff for an update, since they never even spoke to us after we made our order.Well now we got our food at least right? Well I wish that was the end of it all.The food was terrible.My beef yaki soba was tiny and there was barely any meat in it at all.  Curl your pointer finger to the tip of your thumb. The empty area between your fingers can fit all the meat that was in the dish. The meat that was in it had NO flavor at all. It was as if they forgot to add anything, not even salt.The noodles tasted alright, but they were nothing special, average at best. My girlfriend got the salmon bento box. The piece of salmon in it was tiny as well, and was so salty she couldn't eat it after the first two bites. Same goes for the veggies that were soaked in that sauce. The rice in the bento was probably the best part of the whole meal, and it felt like they didn't add quite enough water to it.After being first ignored by a waiter when I tried to get my check, we got to wait another 15-20 minutes before it was brought to us. Awful experience. Not even considering giving them a second try after that (and I'm usually willing to try every place at least twice) Stay away",

I have gone twice and each time ordering something a little different and I can only offer praise to this restaurant.I once asked for a chicken tempura which was not on the menu but they went ahead and made it for me. It was really good so I am puzzled why they do not put it on the menu at some point. Their teriyaki glaze is quite good: not too salty but not too sweet. I also like the cut-up vegetables they put alongside it. The yakisoba is great too with a little more noodle than veggie and/or meat. The sushi, while I chose the tame Tuna roll, was very tasty and well wrapped. It tasted fresh and I felt like I did not have to pay an arm and a leg like I would elsewhere. The miso soup was also likeable and that is a big compliment from me because usually I am not a big fan of miso.Anyway, give this place a try. Definitely worth the trek downtown and it is the right price range for a college student.",

Before eating, you always get the miso soup and cucumber salad.  With the lunch bento boxes, you also get a ginger salad, a few pieces of tempura, some caliifornia rolls, your entree choice, and some rice.   The best choices are the sushi and the calimari, I think, but it's all really good.  The prices are very reasonable, too - about $7-8 for all that food.The soups are massive and very good, too.  I am not sure if there is anything better for a cold winter day or if you aren't feeling good.For dinners, there are meals like the bento boxes or sushi.  I've never been disappointed with the sushi here, either and it is definitely some of the very best I've had in the midwest.  They do not skimp on the fish, either - with the nigiri, there is always plenty of delicious fish.  Prices are reasonable, especially for what you get.This was the first place I had uni, the delicious creamy sea urchin.  It's a little scary looking  at first, but it is incredibly good if you are feeling adventurous.I've never ordered dessert because I've always been too full from the entrees.I have been here many, many times and the only time the service was slow at all was on a busy Saturday night.  Generally, service is quick and attentive.  Decor is not overdone.Like I said - one of my favorite restaurants in town, and definitely my favorite sushi place.",

I don't like Yellowfin (inconsistant with freshness), I don't like Sushi Rock or Sushi Avenue (both cheap but neither tastes very good), I definitely don't like Kamakura (bad service and crappy food), I don't like Miso (Urbana...across from Carle??), Oishi is ok (#2 on my list for sushi, but a very distant #2 -- they get points for creativeness and plating) and Kofusion is local but is very over rated ($1 sushi night on Monday is ok, but most selections are cooked and have either cream cheese or something \"tempura\" worked into it one way or another).  And it still stands that there is no good gyoza in Champaign.... no one pan fries them properly... they're usually very soggy and the filling sucks.  Better off to make your own.They have bento boxes for about $10-$13 for lunch.  They start you off with a cold noodle dish (very good) and some miso soup.... I had my one year old son with me once, and they brought out more tofu cubes for him.... he gobbled them all down saying, \"More cheese! More cheese!!!\" (whatever gets him to eat tofu! LOL).   The fish is good -- I mean, it's not the kind of fresh fish that you'd get in Tokyo or NYC, but it is GOOD.  The rice is seasoned well.   The tempura in the box is also very good -- not a heavy breading like other restaurants have.   I came in the other day at 1pm and it was BUSY.  The busiest I've ever seen.  There was only one waitress.... but the service was OUTSTANDING for it being one service.  She had some sort of system down because she had it down -- no one was left waiting or fuming.  Water glasses were kept filled, food was hot (or room temperature if you ordered sushi), food was prompt, checks were dealt with fast and I was left dumbfounded -- I couldn't believe how wonderful the service was that day -- I mean, I didn't want the waitress chit chatting with me but for the amount of tables she was dealing with, it was excellent.  I tipped her well that day..... and this is why I gave this restaurant five stars today..... usually it would be about a four star.... but her service (and I believe she is either the wife of the owner or at least a long standing waitress) was impeccable.",

SIXTEEN dollars.  yep.  apparently inari rolls now have gold flecks in them or something, because in a little over two weeks the price skyrocketed by $10.  i brought it to said stressed out older lady, because she had taken my to-go order.  she just kept repeating that it was \"today's price\".  she totally seemed angry and upset that i had even asked.  i had though.  because....listen, lady... i don't think tofu has a market price like seafood.  even if it does... it's f'n tofu.  no one had to go out on the wild seas and wrangle it.  i paid it.  for some reason two cucumber rolls, an order of fried rice, and 4 inari rolls came to a little under $30 that day.  i gave that rude lady $16.... and i hated every minute of it and every minute of eating what now felt like total rip off inari.i haven't been back since that.  it's a shame too.  the food is really not so bad.  not gold plated tofu prices, but good enough.",

They have tons of different kinds of rolls. Something for everyone! It can be hard to remember what you want so the ordering sheet is pretty handy. They also bring out a bunch of little salad and soup prior to the sushi. It was pretty cute and tasty! My boyfriend ordered teriyaki chicken which was good but a little salty. All in all, we had a great time and everything was tasty and not super expensive.",

I lived in Japan for 9 weeks a couple years ago and understand the quality of food and service that you get there, but I certainly wouldn't hold restaurants in Champaign to that same standard. This is a small University town and access to fresh seafood is limited at best.Having said that, I was rather underwhelmed by Sushi Kame. The server (a middle-aged Korean lady) was very demanding and impatient. My girlfriend takes a long time to decide what she wants and when we were given the extensive menu, I knew it would be a while. So I asked the server if we could order the egg yolk sauce with rice dish side-dish while we looked at the menu. She gave me a very accusing look, as though I was committing some sort of crime, and then scampered off to put the order in.When she returned,  I attempted to order several more authentic Japanese items like [kama] toro, uni, and oyster, only to find none of these were \"in season\". We settled on a special spicy salmon roll, the green turtle roll, and several pieces of nigiri.As others have mentioned before, the egg yolk sauce with rice was really delicious. It is very rich, so you will need to share it with someone. The sushi was rather ordinary (by Champaign standards). The rolls fell apart prematurely indicating the rice did not have the right consistency/stickiness. The ginger was mild in flavor, the wasabe obviously dyed horseradish, and I swear they served regular soy sauce, not the special variety for sushi, because it was extremely salty.I can't comment on other dishes on the menu, and they may be delicious, but I'm not likely to come here again. For me the rudeness of the server coupled with the subpar sushi was enough to deter me from this restaurant.",

Regardless, I yelped to my heart's content and settled on Sushi Kame.To start, when I looked at the menu I was shocked at the prices.  They were charging $4.50 for a bowl of edamame and some of their other appetizers and sushi rolls were just way overpriced.The miso soup was very bland and the barely filled up half the bowl.  I work at a sushi restaurant and our miso soup isn't amazing or anything but it has flavor to it that the miso soup at Sushi Kame was lacking.  As for the portion size, I just didn't understand why they couldn't fill up that extra portion of the bowl...Next, the house salad.  The dressing is a staple that I've tasted at many Japanese restaurants and this one was just too sour and I couldn't take more than one bite.Now, the main course.  I ordered the Love-Love roll and the Sushi Special, which comes with 5 pieces of nigiri and a california roll.  I'm not a fan of the california roll so I asked the server to replace it with a spicy tuna roll and that I would gladly accept any upcharges.  She didn't know how much it would be so I asked her to just let me know.  She came back and informed me that it would be $0.25 extra.  She then returned 2 minutes later saying that it would actually be $1.00.  Now I wouldn't have minded paying that if she told me that from the beginning.  But it seems to me that if you're going to tell a customer a certain price for something you shouldn't go back on it...that was a little off-putting.  My love-love roll was okay, but the cilantro was a little overpowering.  I don't know if i would use whole leaves of cilantro in one roll..and the spicy tuna that came with my sushi special, well..it was one of the worst spicy tuna rolls I've ever seen or tasted in my life.  It had no flavor to it, and it was falling apart.  It was basically like the sushi chef put a piece of tuna and a little spicy mayo over it.  Again, because I work in a sushi restaurant I know that it takes a bit more preparation than that to make a spicy tuna roll.  And if you can't manage to make a simple roll like that, I don't know what that says about your skills.  The only thing that I enjoyed about my meal was the nigiri as the fish was fresh.Needless to say, I will not be returning.",

As a side note, they play bubble-gum J-pop music over the speakers, while I think more mellow artists (like YUZU, Mao Abe, Yui,  etc) would be a much better match for a dining experience.Sakanaya on Green St. is a bit pricier, but an all-around better experience.",

I understand this is a lot of sushi to make, but it took about 25 minutes to get our food. I wished that the sushi was chilled a little more, but it was just made. I am not a fan of miso soup, but my friends liked theirs. I also  had the cucumber noodles. I was not a fan of them. We ordered the avocado role, two salmon rolls (one spicy and one mild), and and shrimp roll. They were all good. I did not have a problem with the fish being \"rancid\" like many other reviews.

It was so spicy, you couldn't even taste any flavors of the roll... which completely defeats the purpose of sushi. The edamame was good but grossly overpriced at $3 for a tiny little bowl. The tempura sampler dish was really tasty and priced fairly. It took forever to get service any single time we needed anything, even though there was almost no one in the restaurant when I came one weekday night.

After that they give you a (also free) miso soup, which is pretty good as far as miso soup goes.    Oh, and the green tea is free and they use real matcha as far as I can tell.  It's got a really nice, light, floral taste.I've also been to Yellowfin a few times.  While Yellowfin is good, the reason that I like Sushi Kame more is probably their \"American Sushi\" combo.  For about $14, you get three pieces of salmon nigiri, three tuna nigiri, a salmon roll, and the house salad, which is lettuce with ginger dressing.  The slabs of fish on the nigiri are nicely cut and usually pretty thick, giving the sushi a rice-to-fish ratio that definitely favors the fish.   Speaking of the fish, it has always been fresh and clean-tasting, never \"fishy.\"  Admittedly, I've only had non-midwest sushi once, so my basis for comparison is only other sushi in Illinois.  When it comes to maki, I usually stick with the simpler stuff that lets you taste the fish more, so I can't offer much of an opinion on the super tempura fried california rolls or whatever.  The unagi rolls are good though.I've had the sea urchin here as well, and while it's softer than the stuff at Yellowfin, there's also more of it and it tastes really, really good.",

On the outside, the place doesn't look like much, but the interior has a warm atmosphere and the staff is friendly, if a bit overwhelmed (my only complaint was the service, but I attribute this to their being understaffed)If you're a sashimi person, be warned that the prices are a wee bit on the \"are you kidding me?\" side, but it's worth it; I don't know how they do it, but the times I've had their American Sashimi, the salmon and tuna were PERFECT - fresh, succulent, and slightly chilled. They have a large collection of rolls, and being a pro-spicy person, I like their selection of spicy rolls. Great place, and highly recommended",

My second visit I ordered various rolls. They were decent. I thought I would enjoy it more but it would either be lacking flavor or it wouldn't be enough. I do enjoy their appetizers- the miso soup and the cold noodles. I wish I knew how to make those. As for the ambiance, it's comfortable. It's good for dates or meetings. That said, it's a little more chaotic on really busy days. Expect the sushi to take a while especially when everybody else is ordering them. The service is fine as well. Nevertheless, I wouldn't completely forget about Sushi Kame. There's such a few selection of good restaurants when it comes to sushi at Chambana and Sushi Kame will still be able to satisfy your cravings.",

Instead of dinner, we came during lunch, and we were pleasantly surprised at the great deal of the bento boxes and other lunch specials! For about $30, we each got a golden scallops appetizer, a teriyaki steak box, a tonkatsu box, and an order of chicken yakisoba. We finished with stuffed bellies and had leftovers to go! The service was quick and the restaurant was clean as usual. The bento boxes came with a lot of rice, two pieces of California rolls, salad, and tempura. Everything was delicious and the pork and steak were really juicy. Prior to getting our food, we were served a complimentary miso soup and cucumber noodles.Besides that, I want to really highlight the golden scallops! While Sushi Kame is a sushi restaurant, don't neglect the rest of the menu - ORDER THIS!! It's soooo yummy! The menu description is \"sea scallops topped with light egg sauce\" which sounds uninteresting, but it's definitely worth ordering. The menu literally does this appetizer no justice. Served on a lovely shell, slices of scallop are baked with Kewpie mayo giving it a melt-in-your-mouth texture and savory, yet sweet taste. It's covered in a light egg sauce and there's also a side of it that comes with it. The salty flavor and creamy feeling of the extra sauce really compliments the scallops. Pretty to look at and great to eat! Sharing may not be possible even with the large amount of scallops - I really devoured this! While Sushi Kame is off-campus and less accessible than Sakanaya, I love it so much!",

Unfortunately, it sells out very fast and they don't always have it made - so I always make sure to call beforehand to make sure its in stock. Several times, they told me that they did and when I arrived, I learned that they had lied. So be careful.Their sushi is pretty decent quality, but nothing extraordinary. Its a bit on the expensive side and the rolls are somewhat bland, but if you know how to order correctly, you can get a great meal. I'd suggest getting either the Love Love Roll or the Vienna Roll, which comes with miso soup and a small cucumber salad. Then I usually get a house salad (it comes with a very good ginger sauce) and a side of golden rice. It comes to about $13 and leaves you filled to the brim - making Sushi Kame my favorite sushi place in Champaign.",

Another 20 minutes to get our 4 waters, then we tried to order, but she ran away. Flagged her down and put in our order another 10 minutes later, then started making bets to see how long it would take to get our food. Mind you, we were already there for 55 minutes with only water. Needless to say, we all were under. It took them, I believe, 57 minutes to bring out 2 rolls, sashimi, and soup. ...but there were 4 of us. Our fourth order didn't come in until after everyone had already made a dent in their food (he felt bad and didn't want us to wait until he got his food). I was so angry, I can't even remember how the sushi tasted. We also didn't receive that cucumber salad thing that every other table received, and only got our miso soup upon flagging her down. We TRIED to be patient, we TRIED to get attention from any waitress we could, but nothing. I felt I should express how completely dissatisfied I was with the service to the manager, so I did (very kindly, btw). She responded with something along the lines of, well you didn't make reservations, then continued to say that because we hadn't made reservations, they're not obligated to cater to us as quickly as the customers that did. ...REALLY?Moral of the story? ...make reservations or you'll get treated like garbage here.",

I came here with a couple of friends on a Wednesday night and had a very pleasant experience.The service was very good. After taking our order, we were served some miso soup followed by some cold noodles. Our sushi rolls were brought out not long after the noodles. Between my friends and I, we ordered rolls of spicy tuna, negi hemachi (sp), unagi, dragon, shrimp tempura, and crab. Everything tasted great. However, I personally liked the dragon, unagi, and spicy tuna above the others. It can become a little pricey but it is worth it for good sushi in this town. Overall, it was a  pleasant experience and I shall be returning soon.",

Especially the noodles! The food came out fairly quickly given that the place was pretty busy. We got spicy shrimp tempura, love-love, volcano, dragon, and other sushi rolls (we ordered too much, so I don't remember all the names). Everything tasted wonderful, and I love that our sushi rolls came in a huge BOAT! Overall, service was great, the fish was fresh, and the rolls were lovely. My friends and I will be back soon :-)",

I was trying to find a really nice fancy place with good authentic sushi, good service and acceptable prices. I was ready to pay much.First, service could be better: in the beginning the waitress handed in with her two fingers some cold dirty towels, instead of brining them on the dish, hot and carefully rolled. Second, all rolls and soy sauce are impossibly salty, which is nonsense for Japanese food. Rice is dry, tobiko looks like scraps, and salmon in phili rolls is way too smoked. They have only one kind of tea, which is tasteless. They do not have any big combos with all kinds of nigiri, sashimi, maki, etc. to try everything. Also, they do not serve any veggie sides. As a result, this place is greatly overpriced.Pluses:- good ginger; they give about three pieces of it, but can bring more upon request; same with wasabi.- they refill your tea-cups.- nigiri-sushi are really nice: fat and delicate salmon and tuna. - nice and quiet atmosphere.So, imho, one should go there and eat as much nigiri as one can. This is definitely the best food they have in their restaurant.If you also bring your own soy sauce, it could be of some use too. =))",

The place was small and pretty empty as the University was on spring break, but the sushi was very good.  The spicy tuna hand roll was clean and layered (opposed to mixing chunks of ahi with the ubiquitous spicy sauce),  I also had the tempura scallop roll, which was awesome! Again clean flavor and the scallop was noticeably fresh.   I had  a few other simple pieces and each one was well prepared.

The Nigiri was quite good, and the sweet rice was cooked perfectly. The rolls we had were Crunch (good flavor with a good crunch), sweet potato (best tempura-based roll I've had), Alaska (pretty good, I don't remember much of it, though), green turtle (better than the Crunch) and volcano (not nearly as spicy as it should be).I sort of wished the soy sauce wasn't just salty (it tasted like the stuff that comes out of the bottles at standard Chinese restaurants).

The bento box is huge! and it has a bit of everything... some salad, assorted tempura, rice, california rolls (that can be replaced with any of their regular rolls with a small charge). Definitely don't recommend the bento box if you just want a light dinner. Luckily, I was really hungry so it was perfect for me! I ordered the Tonkatsu (Deep fried pork) bento box while my mom ordered the salmon teriyaki bento box. My tonkatsu bento box was really good except for the one piece of ebi (shrimp) tempura. I don't know how to describe but it just tasted really weird. I think they don't let the oil drip and dry after they deep fry the shrimp so it doesn't get nice and crispy. Instead, it was kind of soggy which was disappointed. Also their Tonkatsu sauce tasted funny. I don't know if they make their own sauce but it definitely didn't taste like traditional tonkatsu sauce. My mom's salmon teriyaki was delicious! Salmon was cooked so nicely and it came with sauteed vegetables as well. Between the salmon teriyaki and the tonkatsu, I'd definitely say the salmon was the better choice! The good thing about sushi kame was the service. Our server was really helpful and nice. She recommend the love roll to me in replacement of the california roll and what a great recommendation it was! Overall, I was very satisfied.. oh, did i mention that a bento box is only 12 dollars? All that food for 12 dollars!!!!! Amazing. Definitely will come back again soon.",

Everything else was great, though. The BF got their chirashi, and he thought it was great. He has been back, and said it was good on his second visit.",

It comes with miso soup, delicious cold cucumber noodle salad, and then much more food. The veggie tempura is always perfectly fried and never greasy or soggy. The sushi is fresh and tasty.  Even at lunch, the service is usually pretty quick.  What I really appreciate about them is that the restaurant is so clean.  There is no dust in their venetian blinds or the fake flowers in the windows.  How do they do this?!  I ponder this question as I sit eating way too much awesome sushi.  I've had sushi at a few other popular places in Champaign but nothing beats Sushi Kame for taste and value.",

You get miso soup and a little dish of noodles before the meal. Awesome! My friend also loves the beef soba soup. Service is very fast during dinner hour and the waitresses are very attentive.",

In a small city called Champaign, isolated in the middle of the United States, far away from any ocean body, the people at Sushi Kame conjures up some of the best sushi I have ever had.  In the middle of freakin Illinois, who would've thought.  My roommates and I were feigning for some sushi and decided to try out this place, what a great surprise.  Its a small joint, nothing fancy, with cute waitresses and cheap dining furniture.  But who gives a damn, they make the best Uni and salmon nigiri.  My all time favorite sushi is the uni (sea urchin).  Every place I have been to, except for one, had uni that tasted really fishy.  And I hate that!  But this place had the most buttery, savory, fresh uni that I have ever had.  It was so good, I ordered 12 uni nigiri pieces the third time I went.  The second time I went they had ran out of uni, crushing my delicate little heart into tiny tiny pieces.    The food is great, my roommates ordered some rolls and teriyaki dishes which were all excellent.  The prices are very reasonable and service is good.  If your ever out here in this quaint little college town, Sushi Kame is a must.",

Golden scallops app also delicious if you're looking for warm, creamy, buttery, savory. Come here for a nice, quiet date :)",

I waffled on whether I should give them three stars or four, but I really think that they could improve on a few things, and settled on three stars.The Good- The space is small, but not tightly-packed- Our waitress was sweet and friendly- The chef sent us a free dish - tempura-fried seaweed-wrapped whitefish garnished with octopus (squid?) tentacles.  It was very good, and a nice gesture.- The maki we ordered (Spider, Silk Road, and Crazy rolls) were very tastyThe Not-as-Good- The space is small, so every time the door opened, freezing cold air blasted in- The waitress was understandably busy, as she was the only one working the whole restaurant, but this meant that she couldn't give much attention to any one table- The appetizer we ordered, shumai, was so close to being really tasty - it was five pork-filled dumplings with a wasabi sauce.  Now, I love wasabi, but it overwhelmed the sauce and made it difficult to taste the dumpling itself.- The maki was kind of...I don't know...sloppily-rolled?  Two of the three rolls we ordered were pretty big and tended to fall apart.Champaign isn't exactly a booming sushi metropolis, so I'll be back...hopefully they can bump my experience up a star!",

Chefs/the waitress were friendly as we were leaving as well. Very satisfied with the experience.",

                "review": "I must start out by saying that this would have been a 4 star review had they not served us pumpkin soup that tasted like an ashtray with a splash of pumpkin. It was very sweet that they would give us free pumpkin soup, however I would much rather have never ever tasted it. I might have paid them not to give it to me had I known.That had me worried, but my worries dissipated when my shumai arrived with spring greens in this amazing sauce for $4.45. They were amazing, shrimp dumplings with just a tiny hint of oniony flavor. I ended up putting in a second order. I was also happy when my crispy shrimp roll arrived. I was nervous about spicy mayo as I HATE MAYONNAISE but it was delicious. They don't overload it w/mayo and the shrimp were great and the tempura crisps were awesome. After asking for our check, we were surprised to get a free dessert of tempura bananas and what i think was a tangerine but could have been a fresh mandarin orange? Again the sauce was awesome and so was the tempura. Plus, it was a tempura banana for pete's sake! I would have paid for this dessert.The food came out very quickly as compared to other sushi restaurants in town and would have been darn near perfect without the free pumpkin ash tray soup. (As a former smoker, I'm not exaggerating. If you want to lick an ash tray then have a bite of pumpkin you've got the idea of the soup).  The location is sneaky. Google it if you don't know the area, totally worth what I paid.",

                "review": "I've been going to Yellowfin as my \"sushi place\" (once every 2-3 weeks) for about a year. Initially, I was just happy to have an option that wasn't incredibly overpriced and over-focused on fancy tempura-laden rolls. Simple sushi is where its at, and its what they do well.Unfortunately, the quality of their food has only gone down, and after tonight I'm not going to be taking my business there anymore. We got into the restaurant around 6:50pm. Not peak dinner-time, but still kind of crowded in the small space. There was ONE waiter working the 6-7 tables there, and he was clearly being run ragged. He provided decent customer service given his situation, and was definitely handling it as well as he could.No amount of customer service can make up for crappy food and unsatisfying portions, though. The \"combo\" platters are little more than some type of protein (shrimp, scallops, chicken, beef, or tofu), and some vegetables thrown into a wok that might have had soy sauce in it at some point during the day. No kidding, I don't think there was even teriyaki sauce on there...just soy sauce. I can, and do, make better stir fry at home. Their sushi is small, but they serve it nice and cold, which is a step up from other restaurants in the area. The fish is of decent quality (re: it won't kill you), but today I noticed that the portions of fish had gotten even tinier over the last few months. I think the chef was slicing the fish in half lengthwise, it was so thin!They do not include soup and salad with your meal, unless it is one of the above-mentioned combo platters. This is garbage. Soup/salad is par for the course for most places now, and no amount of icky tempura-fried banana and slim pieces of fruit served as \"dessert\" can account for that. The salad dressing for the house salad tastes like water, and they use it like soup; my lettuce was SWIMMING. Pros: cold sushi, well-flavored rolls and nigiri, and a lot of optionsCons: # of waiters available, soup/salad for extra charge, super tiny portions, and very overpriced. I won't be back. There isn't much in the way of sushi in Chambana, but there is better than this.",

                "review": "By a strange set of circumstances, I ended up going here three times in less than a week.  So I got to try a lot of different things.  In short: rolls are great, nigiri is okay, bulgoogi is good but a little pricey.Overall, it's a solid place.  I still like Sushi Kame just a little better, but it's a lot closer than it used to be.  The rolls (maki) are the way to go here - they're really good, and there's some clever combinations.  The ume jiso is a sour paste, mint, and cucumber - it's awesome, the sour flavor is extremely intense and unlike any other sushi roll I've had.  The crazy roll is really good, too, and so is the unagi.  The tempura squid is also tasty.  The prices are pretty reasonable definitely in line with most of the other sushi places in C-U, and cheaper than Ko-fusion.  It's nice that they have a good selection of different entrees - even people who aren't crazy about raw fish can find something to eat here.I do not recommend the nigiri (where you get a piece of fish on top of a little \"cake\" of pressed rice) so highly.  My girlfriend and I split a Sushi special and the amount of wasabi on some of the rolls was overwhelming.  I like wasabi, but there shouldn't be so much on the nigiri when it comes out that your sinuses burn and your eyes tear up.  It really overwhelms the flavor of the fish at that point.  At first we thought it was because they were so busy, but a friend got the same thing on our second visit, and there was still too much wasabi.  Also, though the sushi special gives you a lot of pieces for the price, there were some repeats - 2 shrimp, and 2 tilapia, which I think are some of the cheaper fish.  Neither was all that flavorful.  Because of this, I think Sushi Kame is still better when it comes to nigiri.The bulgoogi is good, and comes out with veggies - looked like carrots, zucchini, mushrooms, onions.  However, at $14 it seems a little pricey.  I didn't have it, but another friend got the teriyaki chicken, and the portion was very large.They do some special things like bring out complementary seafood pancakes before the meal, and desserts like tempura bananas and oranges.  That is nice.  Service really depends on who's working and how busy they are.  It's generally not really fast - I only saw the one sushi chef working when I was there - so that's something to be prepared for.  One friend was there for her birthday, and they brought out little candles stuck in wasabi for her, so that was a nice touch.If you like sushi and you stick with the rolls, you'll get the most out of this place.  I recommend the rolls pretty highly - they're probably the best I've had in town, and like I said, prices are reasonable. They're also one of the few sushi or Asian restaurants open on Monday, which is nice to know when your week is off to a bad start and you really want a sushi fix.",

Here's why Yellowfin gets 2 stars:-The size of the nigirizushi was small, particularly the rice.  The cut of the fish was fine, but the rice underneath was way too small.-The rice was sloppily formed.  The rolls had rice poking out from both ends past the seaweed and the nigirizushi rice was not properly formed.  Now, this isn't to say that the rolls didn't taste good, because they did; however, presentation is very important when is comes to Japanese cuisine.-The nigirizushi was placed on top of a bamboo leaf.  Now this looked nice, but bamboo leaves have a very distinct taste and it definitely added a strange flavor to the nigirizushi rice.-The sushi platters did not come with miso soup or a salad.  This should be included in the meal because Japanese meals don't just consist of one large plate.  There are always small elements to be included, like a salad or soup.  These you had to pay extra for for a ridiculous price for its size.  This I disliked more than anything.Anyways, I hope this review helps.",

One had been hesitant to eat here as last time he had found a bone in his sushi, but we figured 'hey, it happens!' and gave yellowfin a chance.  Worst.  Decision. Ever.  Between the three of us we found 4+ bones in our sushi.   The sushi was painfully average and the ratio of wasabi to rice in the nigiri was either too weak or too strong.  Speaking of wasabi, theirs had this weird gritty consistency to it - kind of like when you make a paste with flour.  And it was really, really weak.  Ick. I'm not even sure the agedashi tofu we ordered contained tofu - it was this weird mess of over fried... something?  batter? panko? And resembled little crumpled piece of paper.  Yeah no.  Not good.We were seated at the bar which also doubled as the area where food was served from.  It was interesting to see the number of orders that had to be brought back or changed because the chef had forgotten something.  It was extra interesting to watch the plates get passed over my friend's head while we are trying to have dinner. Our server ensured we had plenty of time to talk by being completely inattentive.  It took him easily 15-20 minutes just to take our order and then we waited... and waited... and waited for the food to come out.  Thankfully my friends are good company or the wait would have been excruciatingly painful.  The one time he did check up on us we mentioned all the bones we had found and his response was to nod, do a little laugh, shrug and walk off.  Right.  I must have missed that becoming an appropriate reaction.  My bad.All in all a bad experience.  Never again.",

After reading some good reviews on Yelp, ordered the Pork ramen. I was starry eyed and dreaming about delicious, shoyu ramen with slices of pork belly. And... when the dish finally arrived what did I see? A spicy broth? That's... somewhat strange for ramen. But I'll eat it. What about the noodles? Clearly instant.... Two lonely pieces of shrimp and some hard, overcooked chunks of pork that had no flavor whatsoever. The broth tasted exactly like that of Shin ramyun. For a $11 price tag, I expect more than some instant ramen. I can get that at home.We did also try some of the sushi which was definitely better than some other options near campus.

Don't expect thick, sugary teriyaki sauce; this place is more like Teppanyaki -- simple, healthy, but still YUM. 2. Sushi is quite good, but sushi rice isn't quite sticky enough. You don't get the level of mechanical stability or presentation (or pretension) of Maruya in SF, but that isn't the point of this place!  3.  Bulgogi is top-notch -- not quite as good as my mother-in-law's, but still really good!Given the price, 5 stars overall.",

It's true that sometimes servers have bad days and are grumpy, and that's no problem, we've all been there.  There are also sometimes mistakes in food, and likewise, a chef or sushi chef could be having a bad day.Still... when I was serve edamame in my lunch bento... and there were literally maggots coming out of the edamame... i was pretty horrified.  It was definitely one of those situations where you know the food is old.  The edamame was lifeless, brown, old.  And to my surprise, there were maggots in it having at it.So being as tempered as possible, I alerted the server who apologized and took it away.  I was expecting one of two things... 1, the server (or owner) will come to the table, apologize, and comp my meal.  2, nothing will happen until I receive the check, and the meal will be comped on there with some kind of apology note.By the time the check came, neither of the two happened.  Giving the restaurant one more chance to make right their wrong, I politely asked if I could get my meal comped since there were maggots in my food.  The server responded politely that the owner said there was no way for anyone to know there were maggots in the edamame.  Even though the edamame was all pretty much opened up with maggots coming out of them when it reached the table in the first place.So... there you go, I gave every chance for them to make right their wrong.  Suffice it to say that getting maggots in your food is a totally unacceptable situation, they took it 3 steps too far by doing nothing about it before the check, on the check, or after the check.  By principle alone, and from fear that the rice, or even fish are likely aging beyond their safe tolerance levels, yellowfin gets a 0 star if I could give them one for committing egregious health code violations, and donig nothing about it.",

However, I'm always out for the best.  Inside, Yellowfin is actually a quaint little place.  It's a LOT smaller than the other sushi joints.  There are about eight tables and a sushi bar.  Don't be fooled by the size though, the sushi is great.  Everything was fresh and they even use real crab.  The sushi selection is expansive and very reasonably priced.  They also serve sushi in to-go ramekins rather than pouches.  Just a little like of mine :)  Those pouches are never enough!  The only problem I had with Yellowfin is that the sushi was not rolled very well.  The pieces were loose and falling apart when I ate them.  So good it doesn't matter though :)",

If you are worried about calories beware that a lot of rolls have spicy mayo, cream cheese, avocado, or battered/fried fish. not all tho, you can get sashimi or lighter sushi rolls. The only complaint that I have is that they only have one chef, and one night I had to wait almost an hour for my appetizer because they had a 12+ people order placed online ahead of mine. They were very apologetic and gave me a free roll. However, I left after the appetizer (and free roll), and I had planned on spending at least $30 more dollars. So I guess they sometimes have more business than they can handle.",

We came for a birthday party (we had a reservation for 6.. but it wound up being 8 and they accommodated us with no questions asked.. +1!) at around 6 on a Saturday, and there were only 2 other tables seated in the restaurant. Service started out a little shaky (our waiter was quite young), but nothing to complain about, really. Once we were all seated and had our orders placed, the evening just went really smoothly (which is really how parties at restaurants should be, I think). Though the rolls took a while to come out (we all ordered sushi in one form or another), we were sent out first a round of complimentary miso soup, and then trays of beautifully presented banchan (or Japanese food presented in banchan style). Our sushi came out pretty much all at the same time (though the waiter forgot one of my friend's second roll order until the end). I've only had the sushi here, so I can't speak for the hot food, but it is very fresh tasting and has clean flavor profiles. It seems to be that the majority of the rolls are dominated by fish and veggies rather than cream cheese/tempura style rolls, which is a nice break from some of the other restaurants in town. In my opinion, the rolls are on the pricey side ($6 for a simple maki to avg $13 for a 'special'), but I come from the land of cheap fish, so Yellowfin is competitive for the market in town. Finally, the chef sent out some tempura bananas topped with mango sauce and caramel. If you've not had a tempura banana, you're really missing out! I guess what impressed me the most was 1) how seamless the service integrated with the table's needs and 2) the effort put into the presentation and quality of the food. We were able to enjoy our night out without having to worry too much about really anything.. everything just flowed. The sushi was beautifully presented, with beautiful pieces of fish as well as intricately carved garnishes.Bottom line: When a sushi craving hits any day other than a Sunday or Monday, I'll be headed to Yellowfin",

I love how the place isn't really located in a very commercial area.. which makes the place a true hidden gem and you gotta look for it. The place is small, gives you that at home feel for some reason. The waitress is extremely sweet and nice, so does the other staff. Rice quality is OK, they really hold the fish/shrimp and veggies together better than other japanese joints where their rice don't hold the content that very well. Sushi may take awhile if there are a lot of people since there's only 1 sushi chef, but very worth the wait. (Last time me and my sister went there, there were actually 2 of them. So maybe that will help the wait lol)Another favorite thing about this restaurant is how they give you free stuff on certain days. We got free seaweed salad, miso soup, tempura banana, and even a 6 pc sushi roll from the chef on different days! They got the best mochi ice cream ever, extremely cold but very good. Their fried rice is addicting for some reason, very different from all the stuff I've tasted.Teppan grill is good, although it seems like they kept changing the portion everytime we go there. Now when they serve the rice, they put it on the plate upside down when I really prefer it on the small bowl so I can \"cup\" it with my chopstick easily. I haven't tried their Korean items but will someday!I will always come back to this place and I can't wait to take my BF from Frisco here! :)",

The food wasn't bad either time, but I don't think it's a good value because of how expensive it is. A teriyaki combo which comes with salad and miso soup, is $18-22. Add in tax and tip and you're basically looking at around $25 for a plate of chicken teriyaki with rice. Again, I don't have complaints about the quality, but it's no better than chicken teriyaki you can get at various other places around town for less than half the price.Same thing about the sushi. You're looking at $19-22 for the sushi combos which come with 7-9 pieces (plus California roll) or 12 pieces of sushi (without roll). Nigiri sushi pieces range from $4 to $7, with my favorites like unagi being around $6. That's more expensive than I'm willing to pay. I think Sakanaya is a better deal.",

We were immediately greeted by the waitress. It was a Saturday afternoon and the place wasn't very busy, only 2 other tables were filled. After being seated, we looked over the menus. A lot of the items seemed fairly priced, comparable to Sakanaya's prices, probably cheaper. The service was good. She gave us free bites of appetizers even though we didn't order any and free dessert (watermelon slices). She was very attentive and refilled our water when it was low. She definitely earned a hefty tip.The food was okay, which is why I brought it to the 3 star level. I ordered a sushi entree along with the New York roll and my friend got the bulgogi. The bulgogi was as good as any. The sushi had too much wasabi. The roll was slightly messy too, not neat and tight. If you're looking for a quick bite and for okay Asian food, I would go here. So long as you're not looking to wait at the long lines at Sakanaya, this would be my second choice.",

Why may you ask...1. My wife got a dragon roll. It was the saddest dragon roll ever. Thinly sliced fish that had a very off color, not vibrant like you would expect and the roll itself was almost falling apart. Check the photos for yourself2. I got the chicken teriyaki with rice. Someone needs to check what the difference is with teriyaki and soy sauce. It felt like chinese stir fried chicken bits. Most japanese restaurants will not dice up the chicken into little cubes and then stir fry it in soy sauce. There was no sweet taste you would expect with real teriyaki sauce and this cost 17.95.... I feel very ripped off!Pro: free small appetizer was given (tempura battered banana and a fish cake of some sort), friendly serviceCons: EXPENSIVE, food is borderline average to belowHidden gem:None",

I mean, how close is the closest ocean exactly?...But after reading good things about Yellowfin, I thought I'd give it a try and see for myself. The restaurant is a little out of the way, but apparently it doesn't keep the \"crowds\" from coming: I went on a Monday night with terrible weather, and the restaurant was still relatively busy. Not too much to say about the place itself: the deco could definitely use more work, and it kind of looks like a cheap Chinese restaurant (with the exception of the sushi bar). But who really cares... The menu is pretty extensive, with mostly Japanese food (and a lot of sushi) but also some Korean items. I ordered the salmon teriyaki combo ($15), which turned out to be a lot more food than I expected: salmon filet and sauteed vegetable in teriyaki sauce, white rice, three pieces of sushi (tuna, salmon, shrimp), salad, a California roll, miso soup, and a scoop of ice-cream!! Needless to say I was full after finishing all that food. And while it wasn't necessarily exceptional, it was pretty good overall and I left satisfied. Not bad for the price.",

Either way, we got a ridiculous amount of food for $30 (Shumai and the Sushi B combo, plus all the free food and a small bottle of very good hot sake), and it was all wonderful.

Perhaps my expectations going in were consequently too high, but I was a bit underwhelmed. I'll chock it up to bad luck, and probably head back to try again soon.We got there before the Saturday night rush and got a lot more attention from the wait staff than I assume you'd get at prime time. The waitress was very sweet and patient as we picked through their menu. We ordered the sushi appetizer which was a basic assortment of nigiri sushi, cucumber maki, and ahi maki. My dinner partner is not a fan of spice and we immediately noticed that the chef was spreading wasabi on every piece. I didn't mind it as much, but it really had a bad effect on them.We soldiered on and ordered a diverse combination of rolls. We tried a Philly roll, scallop nigiri, an avocado and eel roll, a Spider, and a few basic fish rolls. Overall it was passable sushi, but nothing to write home about. The amount of wasabi that permeated the night ended up overpowering a lot of the base flavors I crave. Also, I'm guessing we were getting the leftover stock from lunchtime. By the time we paid the place was filling up so maybe next time a wait will yield better food.Ultimately, it is worth a shot. I'm willing to head back, but I hope our experience was an anomaly.",

The fish was absolutely delicious.  They have rolls for both new sushi eaters (my companion) and more adventurous ones (myself).

Although prices appeared reasonable, portions were tiny and barely satiating.Service is good. Our waitress tonight was friendly and attentive, and based on my past experiences here, this tends to be the norm.There's really nothing wrong with Yellowfin---it's very much a hidden gem and one of Champaign's top spots for Japanese cuisine. That said, nothing about this restaurant strikes me as exceptional, so I'm going to go with a solid four out of five stars.",

We really enjoyed the spicy tuna dish appetizer, and tempura appetizer.On the other hand, the green tea was not hot, barely warm. And, the combination of popularity, close tables, and hard surfaces made the place extremely noisy.

Each roll (eight small/medium pieces) was $11.50. Sushi is usually expensive, but come on, this is champaign urbana and even in high-priced Naperville you don't see these disgustingly high prices. 3 stars because they really need to lower their prices. Even miso soup is $2.50, which should tip you off right there that this place is overpriced. Save your money and eat somewhere else.",

It seemed as though there was some kind of a reunion going on at the table next to ours, which had at least 10 people at it.  They were all getting pretty sauced and obnoxious.

They seem to occasionally bring out freebies to your table, my favorite of which is the tempura banana roll. The only thing that keeps me from giving them a 5 is the service. To be fair, I've only ever gone to Yellowfin as part of a larger party - 8-12 people. Every time, though, something has been.. off. First, out of four trips, we've been told twice that there weren't enough menus for everyone in our party, even though the restaurant wasn't even at half-capacity. The only times we've all gotten a menu is when there are only a couple other diners. Second, it takes a long time for a server to take orders, and even longer to actually get drinks to the table. I understand the food takes a while, and it's worth the wait. The sushi chef is very skilled at what he does. But there's no reason 8 people can't get soft drinks, tea and water within ten minutes of ordering when there are only 15 people total in the restaurant and at least two servers are working. Plus, I've never had refills on any drinks except water, when the menu does mention free refills on iced teas and sodas. I'll keep going back because the sushi is fantastic, but probably only on date nights or with a small group of friends.",

It's a little hard to find the place as it's attached to an Asian grocery store on the side of a larger grocery store's parking lot, but it's worth looking for. Everyone that I've recommended it to has been happy with it! I only have two complaints and they've got nothing to do with the food. The dining area is pretty much a big box with lots of hard surfaces and no real sound dampening, so when it gets crowded it can get pretty loud. Also, one Friday about 8 of us went there for lunch and the place was packed and it appeared that only 2 people were working there. It took about an hour from when we were seated until everyone's food had arrived at the table. Fortunately we had the time but if we hadn't that would have been bad.  But if you're looking for sushi in CU- I recommend it!",

I ordered a lunch box off the lunch special menu which cost me about 11 dollars. The salad was phenomenal! The dressing was sweet and is everything you would expect from a Japanese house salad. The California rolls were rolled well and tasted amazing. The food will surely contribute to my decision to come back. What I did not like: water came out without any ice in it. The server stood in the open and essentially watched us as we ate. I understand this was probably due to the fact that the place was dead for the time, however it's completely unnerving to have someone hover near you while you are trying to enjoy your lunch.Delightful, small, and unbecoming little Japanese place, will be back again.",

Yellowfin is on the edge of the University of Illinois campus (athletic side) and they serve solid rolls for being in the middle of Illinois.  Among the selections, the deep fried lobster roll was probably my favorite and you really need to try the seafood pancakes (which is technically more Korean than Japanese - but if they are well prepared - who cares?).   The rest of the rolls were pretty routine, but I agree with other reviewers that Sushi Kame is still the go to place when you're visiting this small, but well fed college town.",

That or somehow they figured out that it was my girlfriend's birthday dinner and delivered her rolls on a bamboo stand with candles stuck in wasabi balls hahaCONS:- Entrees such as the teppanyaki all fail miserably short in flavor, quality, and consistency- If there are more than 3 tables filled, the restaurant gets overwhelmed and you can expect a dramatic fall off in service and increase in wait times for your food- Miso soup is blandI agree with the other reviewer that lamented the fact that the rice was a little sloppy on the rolls and nigiri. I agree that sushi is an art, but when you're in southeastern Illinois in the middle of the cornfields with Korean sushi chefs, sometimes you just have to lower your expectations on good lookin' sushi. If fresh fish and rolls are what you're looking for, look no further than Yellowfin.The restaurant is run by Koreans, and they seem to be understaffed in the front as well as the back. However, service is attentive when it's not too busy, and the servers are college-age and friendly.There is a Korean market right next door and I would highly recommend stopping by to pick up some groceries or just great Asian junk food like Shin Ramen or those delectable Asian funyuns.Come here on a date or with a small group of friends for the good quality and selection of sashimi and rolls; the ambiance at night is intimate when it's not full. They have large bottles of all 3 major Japanese beers (Asahi, Sapporo, Kirin) for your enjoyment as well.",

Yellowfin was just about as satisfactory as Sushi Kame in my opinion, and neither of them really blew my mind.Granted I got take out and by the time I arrived home the fish was practically room temperature (it was sitting on the counter when I arrived.) I understand the results of rice in the refrigerator, but  give a shorter pick-up time so that it is not prepared after 10 minutes and then sitting out for 15.Many of the reviews for these places rave about the rolls, and for good reason. A sushi roll does some really great things for masking the quality of the fish you are using. Toss in some mayo, masago, and cucumber and it all tastes the same. My nigiri left sooo sooo much to be desired. The tuna was dark and stringy, the salmon almost flavorless, and the rest of the assortment was dry and average. Secondly, too...much...wasabi. Each piece had a huge amount underneath the fish...my sinuses may never be the same. After a few pieces I began disassembling everything to wipe off some of it in order to actually taste the fish.The one roll that really made me smile was the spicy tuna. Rarely do sushi joints use the right amount of mayonnaise, and this one surprisingly does. It was creamy, but not overly so. I cannot speak for any of the cooked food but I am sure they are fine. My personal mission is finding good fish...and I understand the difficulties of that in central Illinois, but I haven't given up yet!",

It sucks that it is on campus as I hate trying to maneuver in campustown and there is NO parking but it is worth the trek if you are looking for the best sushi in Chambana with a side of Ramen and other adventurous Asian fusion options.  (Oh did I mention that are open til 1am or something crazy like that? Holla!)",

When I came to visit my baby brother in college (where the heck is Urbana-Champaign, anyways??), I thought that I would be eating the run-of-the-mill college food.  Mentally prepared for dry burgers and overcooked pasta, I was nearly weeping with joy when I saw that there was a good sushi place.Sakanaya did not disappoint.  My brother and I had the Playgirl and the normal spicy tuna and salmon avocado rolls.  The Playgirl was DELICIOUS (how do you fit that much crunchy flavor into one bite?).  The spicy tuna also came in chunks rolling in spicy sauce, none of that nasty mayo stuff.  It was so good we practically inhaled it.It is a small restaurant, so if you come during a prime time there will be a short wait.  It was around 20 minutes for us at 6:30 PM on a Sunday, so not enough to deter me next time.Now that we discovered Sakanaya, I may be a leeetttle more inclined to come visit UIUC again.  Mmmmmm.",

If you are looking for a more affordable sushi dinner, this is probably not the place for you. The fish is very fresh and extremely high quality. We ordered an assortment of sushi and I was very satisfied with our meal. 4 stars because if you'd like to eat here, seating is very limited and you will likely be waiting for a very long time (unless you go during university breaks!). Word of note: they *do* offer takeout, and we have definitely taken advantage of that!",

The spicy tuna roll was unlikely other sushi restaurants around. They actually use whole slices of tuna, toss it in the spicy sauce and roll it as opposed to other locations. The decor was great and very upscale. I would definitely recommend the \"It's Seoul good\" roll. I will definitely be back, probably tomorrow!",

Naturally, I hopped on yelp to check out the sushi situation in Chambana and came across this place. So glad I did.Since the students were gone for the holiday I thought we would be okay getting in and we were. There was a 5 minute wait which was a-okay with me. This place is TINY so i can only imagine how packed it gets but the short wait gave us time to check out the fish and it looked beautiful so we knew we were in for a treat.We ended up doing a chef's choice sashimi plate and it was wonderful. The fish was fresh and delicious! Service was friendly and efficient and I love the modern decor. By far the best sushi i've had in the midwest. Nice job Sakanaya! Now can you just expand already so next time I come in town i can come in without a wait ;)",

It's got a very modern and relaxed atmosphere which is perfect for a cozy dinner.I've gone several times, having gotten the hotate and tako nigiri which were both really fresh. I would recommend getting the Una Q and Spider if are still new to sushi, otherwise the standard raw rolls were up to snuff.What I will say about Sakanaya is that for once I had an unagi roll that had an ample amount of eel on it! I haven't gone to a sushi place in champaign that actually gives you that much actual sea food, let alone seafood that's fresh.I recommend getting here early or calling to see availability, because the restaurant can probably only seat 30 guests. Don't be afraid to flag down your waitress too, as they sometime's are a little slow.",

It's great that Sakanaya's business seems to be thriving!By the numbers...40: approximate number of guests the small restaurant seats.10: actual number of minutes I had to wait for my table. 1: check-in on Yelp that'll score you a free bowl of miso soup.14: dollars it'll cost ya for an order of bulgogi, and let me tell you, was I craving bulgogi that week!  Entree also comes with soup, bowl of white rice, salad, 2 little dumplings, and 2 pieces of sushi.  Boom.Nigiri: not a number, but fun to say, and I thoroughly enjoyed my yellowtail and fatty salmon ones ($3-4 apiece).Waitress Sophia was so pleasant!  Glad Yelp tipped me off to yet another fine establishment.  Last note: you won't find street parking on Green St.  Look on the side streets, but make sure you have coins to feed the meters!",

However, I wish they had bigger tables instead of making two people sit at one person table because I personally want all my dishes at once but the table did not have room for the other dishes, so that was I a little disappointment. I ordered I Love Tuna and Salmon Roll. Salmon Roll was amazing and very tasteful! I Love Tuna was okay. The spicy sauce that they added took away the flavor of tuna. I will definitely go back there but I will not order I Love Tuna anymore.",

I had a tempura shrimp roll, and it was 7 pieces deep, all big and overflowing with everything you'd want in a roll. But let's talk about the fact that the ownership actually put some care and attention to the details about the way this place looks. Fact is, humans are very much moved by their environment, and Sakanaya designed this place to be an experience. I will gladly pay the prices on the menu to eat this type of fare in a really beautiful space. All others can hit up Panda Express. Enjoy. Nice work, Sakanaya. Really impressive.

My expectations were definitely low, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The broth was flavorful and the ingredients seemed fresh.  It wasn't perfect, although admittedly this is just nitpicking.  The noodles were slightly overcooked so they didn't have the springy texture that ramen noodles should, and there were some noodles that were clumped together from overcooking.  The meat wasn't as tender as it should be, although it was not tough by any means.  The most disappointing thing was that the egg was a simple hard boiled egg rather than the soy sauce eggs you typically find in ramen.",

We went outside to wait, went to some places nearby, and came back an hour and fifteen later to ask about our table.The hostess claimed that because we weren't present, we had been placed lower in the queue. What is the point of a SMS-based notification system if you don't use it?

Walk in the door... oops, 40 minutes wait.  Wha-wha-what?!?!?   Disappointed, I decided to order take out.... since this was my first time ordering sushi here, I decided to just go with my standard order of a spicy salmon roll -- I use it to compare to my standard ideal of a good spicy salmon roll.  Hostess was friendly but said it was 10-15 minutes before I get the order.  ?!!?!?!   The sushi chef is already spreading the rice down on the nori?!!  Whatever.... I had my takeout in hand after 3 minutes.  I think this hostess is just over-exaggerating the wait time so that when your name is finally called, you'll be all excited and feel that expectations are exceeded.I must say that the packaging of my take-out was excellent.   It was in a narrow box with chopsticks,soy sauce, and napkin neatly wrapped around it in an elastic.   That's my only positive point of the takeout.The roll looked awful at fist sight.... something didn't look right about the rice.  Not sure what it was.   It sure didn't taste any better.  99% of spicy salmon rolls that I've had are covered in a spicy mayo.   I swear that this was just squirted with a bit of a sweetened schiracha sauce.  And the rice was not cooked properly... it still had a bite to it and was grainy.  It also was not seasoned properly.... I've eaten at some high end sushi joints in New York AND Tokyo, and I've even attempted to make it and I know that there was hardly any rice vinegar in this.... you could taste every single grain of rice.   You know how they say that sushi is supposed to be the perfect balance of rice to fish and when served at the perfect temperature (body temp FYI), it is supposed to create a wonderful sensation in your mind and body.... yah, well, these sushi chefs need to go back to sushi-school or at least a REAL sushi restaurant and wash rice for three years before they even attempt sushi again.    Again, it was expensive for a salmon roll -- $7.   I've had better from a grocery store (I haven't eaten that stuff in about 10 years but still, it was better.).   I still want to try the ramen, but now I'm not so sure... something in the back of my mind is screaming, \"ARE YOU NUTS?!??!!?\"To the salmon that gave its life for this sad excuse of a sushi roll.... I am sorry, but your death was for nothing.",

The presentation and taste were much better than I had expected from a sushi place in the Middle of Nowhere, Illinois, much less, the United States in general.The price vs quality vs portion ratio though, didn't quite match up.

All of that is great, but what ultimately makes a restaurant special is the food, and our family found the sushi at Sakanaya to be unbelievably fresh, varied and beautifully prepared & presented, and most importantly delicious.  This is just an amazing sushi bar.  We intend to try the Ramen on our next visit.  It looked beautiful when it wafted by.Because Sakanaya has been so wholeheartedly embraced by the U of I student population,  be patient and be prepared for a wait, but the food and the environment make it all totally worthwhile(you can go hang out at a nearby bar or shop and they will call you when your table is ready).  We had a fantastic meal and great time.  If you love great food, then you owe it to yourself to check out Sakanaya.One last note, I concur with Seth's comment re: the early and ignorant review. That was useless and not helpful at all.  Sakanaya is a great restaurant serving great food.    sometimes waiting for a table is worth it and if you consider the quality of the experience and the excellent food, then the value is high and huge.    Great place.  Go now.",

We eat sushi a lot, and wanted to try a new place, especially while the students were out of town.  The atmosphere is great (you feel miles away from campus town on the inside)- very nice decor.  Our server and all the staff were great- they brought us an appetizer on the house which was delicious (they came and explained what to do because we looked a little confused- it was a tower of rice, crab meat (I think), and spicy tuna (I think) with sauces and you mix it together- Mmm!  The sushi was great- very fresh and a lot of variety!  We picked from specialty rolls.  I loved the kamikaze and playgirl, and we had about 3 others too- very filling.My boyfriend had the hot sake and I had the peach sparkling sake, and they were both great.Highly recommend going here!  I'm not sure how busy it is when students are around (parking is a little far away as we parked on fifth street at meters, so may be harder when school is in session), but wonderful addition to campus town and sushi places in town!",

My friends and I all ordered a few different rolls so we could sample them all and I still couldn't pick a favorite because everything was so freakin good.If this place weren't on campus, I would be there often but it just gets a bit busy with students sometimes.

She was very happy with the tekka don (eel and veg over rice). I liked the ramen pretty well. It had a spicy broth with just a hint of richness. I'd like more depth in my broth, and more tenderness in the meat in the bowl, but I was pleased that the dish wasn't tame. For a small, campus-town restaurant, this one has a calm, grown-up atmosphere. It's clean and quiet with quality food. The prices are not low, but the value is decent.",

I initially just wanted to get some ramen to go to satisfy my massive ramen craving I had. When I asked for some ramen to go, they informed me that they do do take out but that they can't do ramen to go. I decided to come in later and boy was I happy that I did! I ended up trying the Willis Tower appetizer which is this deconstructed sushi \"tower\" with tuna, roe, coleslaw, avocado, & rice. The fish was amazing and super fresh and I couldn't stop eating it. I also had a mojito which was certainly tasty but a little on the boozy side. I ended up ordering the miso ramen which was also pretty amazing. My only gripe was that I felt like the pork and egg were a little over cooked for my liking. Also, this place is teeny tiny. Total seating comes to about 30 people. So, I would not try to come here on a typical busier night. Calling ahead or having a back up plan might be the way to do it!I can't wait to come back here for some sushi! This might be my new favorite sushi spot in town!",

It's about what you'll pay at any restaurant, except maybe street vendors or whatnot. Anyways, the ramen is decent, not amazing. It's probably the best you'll find on campus. What makes the ramen? The broth. Being the snob I am, I asked for a little bit of each ramen's broth but was told that they make the broth with each bowl of ramen. Hmm. Some flags when up there. Regardless, I tried both the soy based and chicken based broths and found there was really nothing special about either of them. Again, if you're looking for ramen this place is the best bet, but don't expect anything spectacular.The sushi was what I was more impressed with, as every single place on campus was disappointing me (apart from Cheese and Crackers who imports their fish overnight) but the fish was surprisingly fresh and they gave me considerable chunks of fish for my nigiri. Delicious white tuna by the way.I'd definitely go back for the sushi. If they ever change the ramen or I'm super desperate for some at 2:00 AM or something I'll give this place another try.*Also there were little things I really liked about the place like the atmosphere, the little pipettes they use for soy sauce, and especially the fact that they give you an entire jug of water for your table.",

It was the night before finals week started, so we decided to go all out. The 5 Sushi Rolls that we got were California, Playgirl, Windy City, VIP and Gold Rush. I voted the Gold Rush my favorite (also the most expensive), then playgirl, VIP, Cali, and then Windy City. I'm not really a fan of fish, so I was a little worried about that, but all of the ones we ordered had fish, and loved them all. We got  our food very quickly and everything was gorgeous. The atmosphere was very contemporary and felt like I was in an upscale sushi restaurant in the city. It was nice to have something so close to me at school, and so classy. We left feeling full, but not weighed down. Everything was so fresh and beautifully presented. I will be checking out a lot more sushi restaurants from now on. It was a little pricey (we wound up paying around $115 for the table) but we left extremely satisfied.",

                "review": "Sakanaya is a new sushi restaurant that opened up a couple months ago. You'll notice that it looks out of place because the front looks like it's made out of wood. But as you walk in, the decor makes it look like any downtown restaurant. The interior is small but they make use of every bit of space while making it still look open. My girlfriend and I decided to visit it last Saturday.When looking at the menu, you'll notice that it's just 3 pages (another Yelper posted it earlier). You'll see that it has the standard variety of sushi and rolls with a few unique creations. While some may think the limited menu is disappointing, I consider it refreshing. It reminds me of Big Grove Tavern's menu, where it isn't cluttered and highlights tasteful entrees. My only complaint is that most of the entrees are priced above average.The food, now that's the best part. I've had sushi everywhere in Champaign (Yellowfin, Oishi, Sushi Kame, Ko Fusion, etc.). Sakanaya ranks among the best, as one of the places that serves the freshest and tastiest sushi. I also enjoyed the Champaign/Urbana roll. For those who are new to sushi, the C/U roll and salmon and tuna sushi are good ways to get introduced. The service was good as well. Our waiter was very attentive. He even gave me free miso soup because he thought I'd be \"left out\" since my girlfriend was getting soup with her entree. All in all, I'd recommend Sakanaya as an occasional date spot night. It has some of the best sushi in town for a somewhat high price. You can bet I'll be coming back sometime soon.",

The rolls were average, but the nigiri was fantastic! Perhaps some of the best I've had. The fish was huge, and beautifully displayed. It was obviously a quality piece of fish. Oh yeah, and it tasted good too.We had a bit of a wait for our table, which gave me plenty of time to admire the decor and ambiance (both great). The waitstaff was professional and friendly, even when I couldn't make up my mind, or remember what I had already ordered.Overall, this is a classy place with great food. Next time I'll have to try the ramen, and maybe in a while I'll consider this place 5 stars!",

                "review": "Restaurant reviewIt took 4 tries before finally being able to eat here. The yelp reviews looked solid which is why we had high hopes for good sushi in Champaign. We have been let down by yellowfin and oishi was okay, but this took it to the next level in terms of freshness and ambiance. The first and second time we came here at dinner time the line was out the door. If you have a little one this is quite difficult to stand outside in the cold so we gave up. The third time we came it was closed on new years day. Finally while all of the students were away on winter break, we came at 530 and did not have to wait at all. We ordered the Sakanaya Supreme which included 10 pc sushi+ 15 pc sashimi+ spicy tuna+ spider roll for 55 dollars. After tax and tip this is closer to 70 dollars which is note cheap for dinner on campus. What you get is very fresh fish and well prepared sushi. The salmon pieces were a high note, very fatty and served at the right temperature. The actual presentation for the dish fell sort of flat compared to oishi with a piece of lemon and banana leaf splayed across the dish, but who cares I guess when you talk about food quality. The fish was fresh and there was ample enough food for 2 people. The cuts of the sashimi were generous. My highlight was the spider roll with crunchy soft shell crab that was cooked well. Often the oil used to fry the soft shell crab is over used and has a odd taste, but this was cooked right to perfection. Overall this is the top sushi place in Champaign. The only major downside is high price for the campus area and also very limited seating which means you have to get here early or be prepared to waitPros: very fresh fish, best spider roll in champaignCons: limited seating, be prepared to wait if you show up at peak timesHidden deals:They have some lunch specials, but the savings are marginal",

                "review": "Came here for dinner on a Friday evening. It's a little small, so prepare to wait at prime dining hours. We had the sakanaya and kamikaze rolls and fatty salmon to share. The sakanaya roll was particularly good- crab, avocado, and salmon, topped with scallop and fish flakes. Really, really good. One of the better sushi rolls I've had at any sushi place. Both rolls were nicely presented. Fatty salmon is my weakness, and Sakanaya's is very expensive per piece ($9!) but it was pretty worth it tonight. While it wasn't the best piece I've ever had, it was still melt-in-your-mouth delicious. If you ever get the chance, you need to try fatty salmon! For the rest of our meal, we had tonkatsu ramen. I have to say, I wasn't blown away by the ramen. I'd give it three stars. The broth was the right color and consistency, but it really lacked the richness and pork flavor that tonkatsu ramen should have. It just tasted a little thin and bland. Definitely need to work on that. The noodles themselves were nice and chewy, so no complaints about that. Meat was tasty, but cut pretty thin. Thumbs down for the egg, which was hard boiled and cold... Skimpy on the bamboo shoots. I was happy about the noodles, but the rest of the ramen was just okay. Overall, I'd give Sakanaya 3.5 stars. The sushi is great but I think the ramen could be improved a lot. I'd love to explore the rest of the menu some time. I'll definitely be back, at least for sushi!UPDATE: Ramen still needs work. Still lacking richness and flavor that truly good ramen has. Had to add soy sauce to the tonkatsu at my last visit. Otherwise, sushi is still excellent, probably the best on campus!",

The service was a little bit slow, and seating is limited: there was a 20 minute wait or so to get a table, even though it was past 10PM. The sake was cheap and plentiful enough to make the wait less of a big deal. We finished off our meal with the deep-fried chicken wings from their late-night menu. Quite good! To sneak in one final nitpick, though: the place tries very hard to make itself seem like a big-city sushi joint with its ambiance, and by that I mean music was blaring pretty loud through the speakers during our meal, making it hard to carry on quiet conversation.",

We had to wait about 20 minutes for our seats--which was fine. I understand that there aren't many tables inside. But at about 1:51 (I looked down to check my watch), there were several people who came in to put their names down and the host started turning people away because it was \"too close to 2:00\"--which is when their kitchens close and they start preparing for dinner. NOW, from my experience, it is APPALLING for you to turn away customers before the official closing time of 2:00pm. THIS IS JUST BAD SERVICE, and if i was the one that was turned away, I would've raised a bit of a scene. Felt bad for all the couples/groups that got turned away that day. I don't know if this is a regular thing for Sakanaya or if it was a one-time occurrence, but word of advice--don't turn your customers away because it's too close to kitchen turning time. And don't be crying when your customers start going to some of the other competitors in the area because THEY'RE not turning away customers. My sister got the Tonkotsu ramen and I got their 8pc sashimi lunch special. The ramen was subpar--too bland and their broth wasn't the right consistency--that thick, flavorful Tonkotsu ramen consistency. My sashimi was extremely fresh--the one good part about this experience. And the sushi roll was perfectly average--nothing mind-blowing or not extremely bad either. If it wasn't so overpriced, i would say that the sashimi is pretty much the only thing going for this restaurant.Overall restaurant service was pretty bad too. From the hosts to the servers. Our server brought us our check even before we finished our meal and started cleaning our dishes too soon. It was obvious they were trying to rush us out of there. All-in-all, Sakanaya had average food for being slightly overpriced--but even the fresh sashimi can be overlooked because of their service. TERRIBLE.",

Aside from the pop-up ramen nights that happen from time to time, there hasn't been a place in town to get real ramen.  I'm sad to say that I'm still waiting for a good ramen place.The ambiance in Sakanaya is really really impressive, especially remembering what Sushi Avenue (the restaurant formerly in this location) used to look like.  Very nice date-night atmosphere with low lights and a beautiful interior.  However, that kind of thing factors in pretty low on my set of priorities.  My husband and I both ordered a bowl of ramen.  They're pretty huge, easily a meal by itself or more than that if you haven't got a big appetite.  However, at $12-$13 it was overpriced.  The noodles were sticking to each other (like they'd been sitting around for a while cooling), and the broth had no depth of flavor.  At first bite the broth's flavor was quite good, but as I got closer to the end of the bowl I realized how completely unremarkable it was.  The pork slices were good, but not great, and the hardboiled egg was nothing special, either.  Additionally, I found the inclusion of corn baffling and off-putting.  I would pay maybe $8 or $9 for this ramen.  At Mitsuwa up near Chicago, $10 buys a pretty remarkable bowl of ramen from the Santouka shop, and that is my frame of reference for this meal.We also got a couple pieces of sushi with our meal which were about on-par with our other favorite places in town, Sushi Kame and Yellowfin.  In short, the sushi is good but a bit more expensive than other places in town, and the ramen would be serviceable if it cost about $4 less.  I think you will like this place if you don't mind paying a bit more for a fancy atmosphere, but I probably won't be back.",

We shared the miso ramen, gyoza, a sakanaya roll and a spicy tuna roll (I can't resist) and everything was excellent. The miso ramen was chock full of delectable and thoughtful ingredients, perfectly cooked noodles and slurpably delicious broth. I would definitely order that again, but not before I try everything else on the menu!  The Sakanaya roll melts in your mouth, and the spicy tuna was great too.The hot sake is an awesome (large) portion for $6. Hits the spot when it's freezing outside.Service was fast and friendly, we never felt rushed. The ambiance is lovely, the space feels like a cozy haven you duck into from the sidewalks of campustown--a welcome retreat. You can tell that everyone involved in this new endeavor is taking pride in what they're doing. The wait is long when students are in town, but totally worth it in my opinion.Nick, the manager brought us some extra treats at the end of the meal and gave us a peek at the late night menu. Looks like I'll be venturing to campus for some chicken wings in the very near future! I've already heard great things.We can't wait to return!",

                "review": "I was in town visiting and my cousin picked out Sakanaya for us. We are definitely a ramen loving family, so it's a must that we get together to enjoy a hot bowl on those cold winter days! We walked in for lunch, party of 10 and we were lucky enough they had tables to put together for us. I was digging the ambiance of the restaurant. It had that new, hip feel to it, while still keeping that Japanese classy feel. It got pretty busy after we had been there for a bit, so I could tell this place was popular in town. Also, I do have to mention their ladies room. It was sooo clean! I love when restaurants take care of their restrooms. To me, that is a sign of a good establishment. Our waitress, her name has slipped my mind (Sophia, maybe?) was a sweet girl. Very polite and attentive. She took care of us very well by answering all of our questions and seeing to it that our needs were met. The lunch menu was a bit lacking. It was very small, and from what the waitress told us, we couldn't really order anything off of the dinner menu. We were strictly stuck to the lunch menu, and that was frustrating. I was craving nigiri and sashimi as well! I ordered a bowl of their Soicy Tonkotsu ramen. and split a roll combo (choice of one regular roll + one yaya roll), but she let us substitute a different roll for the yaya, so we ended up getting a tuna and salmon roll for the combo. RAMEN -  It wasn't spicy enough, so I asked for another side of the spicy paste they used in the bowl itself. That made it the perfect level of spicy! Unfortunately, I can't say anything else about the bowl was perfect.. In all honesty, the broth and noodles tasted like instant ramen. The noodles were extremely soft and soggy. The spicy paste made the broth taste better, but it still lacked that heavy, full of flavor, ramen broth I'm used to back home. Also, there was a BUNCH of white onions AND green onions. If I didn't love onions, I would definitely say it was overkill (which is what another cousin said of their bowl). I'm not used to white onions in my ramen either, so that kind of threw me off, and it wasn't enjoyable. But the biggest problem with the ramen that I had was the egg. The egg is my favorite part of ramen, hands down. This egg tasted exactly like my boiled eggs in my kitchen.. The yolk was dry and broke off in chunks, the egg white was bland. It was just.. depressing. I probably could've made this bowl of ramen in a dorm room. SALMON + TUNA ROLL - The cousin I split the combo with ate the tuna roll since I'm more of a salmon kind of girl, so I don't have any comments on that roll, but the salmon was really good. It was fresh and buttery. Pretty good for a plain salmon roll. All in all, I would have given Sakanaya three stars had it not been for the decor, restroom cleanliness, and service. I would return on my next visit for sushi, but count me out for their ramen.",

Seared scallop with bonito flakes tops the roll and it has salmon, crab meat, and avocado (okay, so a really glorified Cali roll), but it's very tasty and presented gorgeously. It's around $14, so be ready to part with your cash! The treat is definitely worth it though.The ramen is delicious, albeit pricey. Huge portions of everything are in your ramen. My only complaint is that some of my ramen noodles had a strange. mild soapy taste. The pork broth had a strong, savory flavor, and I recommend getting the tonkotsu ramen. The slices of pork and veggies are also generous, which I really liked. It's not the best ramen I've ever had, so I don't think the price is warranted. The interior is very small and a bit cramped when it's full of people coming in and out, so be ready to be bumped a bit or squeeze by people at dinner. However, the staff are polite and do their best to stay organized; they use an iPad system to keep track of orders and tables, and they wait in the back or to the side while on standby to avoid collisions. I think it's considerate because the wait might take a while (even with a reservation), so you can walk around on Green Street and they'll call you when a table opens up.So far it's the only place on campus that has good ramen, so I suppose I could say I'm a fan.",

I was a little hesitant though since there were no elite reviews and some of the reviews seem like fakes, but here's mine. Hopefully you can trust me.I walked in and it looks really nice, nice decorations and everything, just really small. Put our name in and waited probably 20 minutes or so to be seated. People love their sushi on a Saturday night I guess. I recommend calling for a reservation, and don't plan on coming if you have more that 4 people since there's barely enough tables as is. From what I read, the ramen was pretty good. My friend told me that too and the waiter said that's what they were known for so that sounded good to me. The gf and I both got ramen, forgot what their names were though. We did have different broths though and I liked mine better. Hers was the first one listed and mine was the second. I'm definitely a fan of this. I usually don't like ramen since you can pay 10 cents and make it in the microwave as opposed to paying 13 bucks for this one, but this was good. Meat was even tender and the dish as a whole was pretty solid.We also ordered a sakanaya roll which was recommended by our waiter. Guess the sushi was backed up since it took a while for it to get out to us. To be honest I wasn't really a fan. Tasted fine but wasn't anything special. It was room temperature, so it just makes me think that it was sitting out for a while, but hey that may be your cup of tea, who knows. But anyway, 4 stars for the ramen dishes pretty much.",

Or those that are flabbergasted that a new, small restaurant with some buzz about it might not have a table open right when you walk in.  Party of seven on the Saturday evening of opening weekend?  Oh, of course.  Luckily some reviews have started to trickle in from people who have a clue what they're talking about.First trip in we grabbed some gyoza (solid) for the table to get things going, and then a Sakanaya Roll and Emperor's Roll to split, along with some otoro nigiri.  The rolls were great, but this place is packing pretty decent fish, so don't be afraid to go nigiri/sashimi.With all of the ramen talk, that was gonna be our focus.  Miso and tonkotsu were both well-prepared, with more noodles than we expected and good (but maybe sparse) pork.  My only problem was with the preparation of the egg that's included, which is more of a personal taste thing, as it seemed like a tea egg.  Overall very good.  We just got back from NYC and managed to squeeze in both Ippudo and a hole-in-the-wall hand-pulled noodle place in Chinatown, so I can't say it's the BEST ramen I've had recently, but we grade this shit on a curve based on location, right?  Second time around I went with the pork bul-goki.  Nice spice and well-prepared.  Miso soup was good and the salad was really nice.  Good to see a place like this open up and go all-out on ambiance and storefront design on top of menu.  Would like to see some more options available for the ramen, but that might be something that comes after the kinks are worked out.",

I had the salmon combo: sushi, nagiri,  and sashimi, which was $21-22. It definitely wasn't the best sushi I have ever had and I found the variety and freshness was lacking. Overall it wasn't terrible but wasn't great.  Exactly 3 stars makes perfect sense for this place.",

I went with two friends, and each of us ordered a regular roll and then split a specialty roll. I wanted to get sake don instead of a roll, but it was just too expensive.

I'm a bit picky about my sushi and I can say that the sushi here is fantastic. I've had their cold noodles and ramen as well. Like the sushi, they all have a balanced composition of flavor and texture. Its definitely worth going to for a nice dinner out on campus.",

The rice, sometimes, is too hard. The fish is also cut irregularly, sometimes they are a good size, other times, it's really tiny. The last time I came here, however, it was really good.

Sometimes there's a long line, I recommend using the \"no wait\" app. Probably the fanciest restaurant on green street, perfect place to bring a date. Signature rolls are about 12-16 dollars. Recommend the \"Willis tower\" as an appetizer. Not really a place to go when you're really hungry cause you'll be spending a lot of money. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 cause of the expensive menu especially for a restaurant on campus. If there was a fire on green street, this restaurant would be the first one to go.",

The udon was definitely spicy (as promised), but not so much that I couldn't enjoy the dish. Overall I was very happy with my meal. The ambiance of the place is very nice, but a little too hip for my taste. Lighting is pretty dim and my friend and I had a little trouble figuring out how the water pitcher worked. In the end, though, I think everything about this place comes together pretty well, and it deserves its spot in Chambana's pantheon of great restaurants.",

The line was so long and you always need to get there 30 minutes before you open to get a seat immediately, otherwise you would need to wait for at least an hour. It was worth the wait because of the atmosphere that's good for dating and seafood was very fresh. However, everything changed. Their seafood is no more fresh, but their prices are way higher than the average. I don't really have a reason going there anymore. Why would you pay more to get something very average?",

With an extensive menu of appetizers, fresh sashimi, sushi rolls, shoyu + miso ramen, and other korean dishes, you will definitely have to take some time to look over the menu. I would have to say that the sushi was the freshest I've ever tasted in Urbana-Champaign. Being from Florida, my standards for sushi are a bit high and have been disappointed over the past 2.5 years I have been living in the CU, but Sakanaya does not disappoint. Location is ideal as it is right on Green Street, the heart of the UofI campus. Parking can be hectic though. ($0.75/hr) Parking is free after 9pm and free on Sundays. There was a line the entire time we were there, but service was fast and friendly, so the line was constantly moving. Also, we went after opening day. The interior and exterior is very appealing, but the inside is a bit smaller than I would have imagined. The tables are pretty close to each other. The man next to our table was sitting alone, listening on our conversation and occasionally talked to us. Prices are a bit more expensive than I thought. Since it is catering to mostly college students, thinking of one's budget, the ramen bowl would've been nice at $8, instead of the $12. Portion size is good - shared a shoyu ramen bowl and kamakazi (sushi roll) with a friend and we were satisfied. (But there was still room left for dessert.) Ramen broths are pork-based. The pork melts in your mouth and the broth isn't too salty or bland - just right. It was a bit lukewarm though, but that's just preference. I like my soups really hot. The salmon on the kamakazi was really soft and melted in your mouth too. Definitely fresh. Tl;dr? - Sushi and ramen are good. Get it. - Atmosphere is romantic. Definitely a date night kind-of place. - Worth the experience/trip, not worth the price. Would've been better if it was $4 cheaper. Where else can you buy authentic Japanese ramen here, anyway?",

The Bulgoki was visually pleasing. I had never gotten Bulgoki with a side salad, two sushi pieces, and two pieces of crispy tofu. I felt like it was worth the price for what I got. I've spent about $12 for Bulgogi at other restaurants, but it was only the meat and rice. So Sakanaya gave a nice addition. I also thought it was a good way to still put a little Japanese influence in the dish. For the Miso Ramen, it was tasty. It was a big bowl of Ramen definitely not something you can find elsewhere on Green St. The pork was very tender and the broth just made it taste better.Overall, it was a good food night. I definitely recommend Sakanaya if you want a nice place to go for dinner. The food's taste matches the decor: awesome.",

The soup was simple and good, but still nice because we got it for free by checking in on Yelp! The wine was fantastic, I've never had anything like it and it had a sweet flavor to it that separated it from western wine I'm used to drinking.I absolutely had to get sushi and my roommate was pretty set on ramen, so we ordered a Sakanaya roll and the shimp tempura ramen. My roll was superb! I believe it was salmon, crab salad, avocado, scallion and fish flake. Good feedback from his ramen too, which was a huge portion!Overall I thought the food was good but perhaps a little pricey. The atmosphere was unique but a little cramped for our (really) little table of 2.Authentic food in a cool atmosphere on campus, which is kind of hard to find but it comes at a price.Strong 4/5.",

I've been here several times while I was out here in Champaign and none disappointed. The ramen is good, sushi is much better than any others in Champaign, and appetizers are delicious! This place will definitely be successful. It's on the higher end in terms of pricing compared to everything else on the street, but you need to treat yourself every now and then. It's on the further end of Green St, but worth the trek.Be sure to try their sushi and ramen out! Their specials have always been delicious!",

And boy did we find one.The Good:-The Sakanaya roll was salmon, crab salad, avocado on the inside and it was topped with torched scallops and fish flakes. It was extremely good, the fish flakes brought an interesting twist to it, great texture,-Blue-fin tuna sashimi. Our waiter recommended the current special, which was priced at 2.5 per piece. Neither my SO or I particularly like sashimi, but we both loved it, it was fantastic.-The miso soup was just the right amount  saltiness and fantastic flavor.-We also got the Una-Q roll and the Salmon roll, and both were well really well wrapped and delicious. The eel in the Una-Q roll melts in your mouth.-The ambiance! It's exactly what we were looking for, upscale but still casual. Fantastic.-The service is also fantastic! Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable. The Bad:NOTHING!Overall:Absolutely fantastic. We will be back again soon, I guarantee it.",

And it opens till late night, in school time usually till 1am, which is great because I can then have some late night food with friends. However, to eat here you usually have to wait for a long time for the  queue, like 20-30 minutes. Also, the food are kind of pricy, it can easily go up to 30 dollars if you order two food items. But the price comes with the quality!",

I wonder if this is owned by the same owner. Yes this is a lot busier than Kato just around the corner. Yes they have a cheaper 1 entree meal at 5.95 for chicken teriyaki. An employee was standing in front enticing you with samples. The food really taste the same, but you get less sauce and less portion here. The meal comes with white rice and for another 50 cents you can upgrade to fried rice or brown rice. You get a side of vegetables which is chopped up cabbage. It also appears that they reheat the food on the hot plate after you order so it is somewhat fresher than the other stands. To me it taste a little less salty than Kato but really has the same taste. Overall you will leave full, but you can definitely do better.Pros: free sample, daily 5.95 chicken teriyaki meal with white rice and vegetablesCons: bland and still saltyHidden deals: Daily special with enough food for 2Health code rating: C, all of these restaurants are so so in the mall.

I was wrong when I got to the table into the but it was cold. So I took it back and the guy was indignant about it after he stood there for several minutes he asked me if you wanted him to make a new one. I said no give me my money back because I'm not going to put up with that. Go give somebody else your business there's two other Oriental restaurant pretty much the same thing. I told them I would never buy that stuff again I suggest you do the same thing go to someone that would appreciate your business. That's a negative one star by the way.",

Very integrated staff, cheese ball appetizers was amazing (had a cream sauce and sprinkled green onions on top), but that doesn't happen any more. The rolls were served with wasabi mayo sauce but that is lacking these days as well. Sushi Rock has fell off considerably since its opening. Took my roommate here and actually felt bad about it when I discovered how everything had changed, and that was within a year or so.",

                "review": "This restaurant just opened yesterday and is owned by the people who run Green Onion (Korean Grocery store on Neil).  The place has a modern feel with a pretty good layout but they seemed to be lacking in decorations, probably because they just opened. The menu for lunch is pretty basic and has your usual dragon rolls, spicy tuna and california rolls, along with some interesting twists like the \"911 roll\" (spicy spicy tuna), Mango roll and Sunset roll (All moderately priced). I went with a bunch of people and we all got the Udon + Spicy Tuna + California roll lunch special, for a cheap price of $8!! California rolls were surprisingly yummy with some tempura crunches on it along with some sweet sauce, and the spicy tunas weren't bad either. Udon was pretty good too, though it's still your basic udon. I didn't try their bento boxes, but they seemed to give you a decent amount for the price. I'll probably try that the next time I come.If you're going to go for lunch, try to order before 12 because that's when it starts to get busy and your orders will take a lot longer to come in.Overall the place is not bad. Not your best place, but not bad. If you're looking for a fairly cheap, simple japanese meal for lunch on Green Street, this place would be a good choice.PS. The also have some Korean dishes in the menu which I haven't seen or tried but I'd guess they weren't too bad since they own a Korean grocery store as well.",

It seems a little funny to me... Anyways, to the review!The atmosphere at lunch time was busy but there was plenty of space available for a party of two. We were promptly served and the food came to us relatively quickly. I ordered the spicy tuna, california rolls, and udon noodle combo, and the veggie yakisoba (enough food for two hungry people). I was not too impressed with the sushi so I do think the better quality sushi can be found elsewhere. However, for the price and it being U of I campustown, I cannot complain. The sushi ingredients were fine but the wrapping job could have been better. I enjoyed the udon noodles which was warm when I received it. It had enough noodles but the best part was the broth. The yakisoba noodles were comparable to noodles that I have had elsewhere like Sushi Kame (but Kame still has better quality). The dish had a great selection of veggies and a proper ratio of noodles and sauce met my high expectations. I am glad that it is closer than some of the other alternatives like Sushi Avenue which may be a stretch for a one-hour lunch. I gave it a three out of five because of its distance relative to campus and the quality-to-price ratio. If you have more time and are interested in better dining at a higher price, consider some of the other Japanese restaurants in town.",

I've only eaten there for lunch, and I like the deal with two rolls and a bowl of udon. To me, it's a lot of food for 8.99. I'm no sushi or udon expert, but I do think they taste really good, especially the udon. Nothing better than to slurp up the noodles on a cold winter's day. The main reason this place didn't get four stars was that I don't like the atmosphere. It's a little cramped. I don't like to feel like I'm sitting on top of my fellow diners. Also, they play Top 40 stuff, which isn't all that appealing to me. I guess they're going for a young feel, but I don't wanna hear that stuff all the time when I'm eating. I guess that makes me old and crotchety.",

Sushi Rock's menu has changed for the better since I've been here, but their sushi rolls are, while delicious, rather Americanized and very expensive. Be warned, sushi takeout is not great here; you're better off eating at the restaurant. Sushi Rock also offers other Japanese fare such as bento boxes, which are very much worth the money in terms of the amount of food you get (they also give you miso soup with it). The service here is quite good as the waiters are friendly and attentive. I've seen the owner come out and do sake bombs with the customers once in a while too.",

This is one of those trendy Asian food places that pop up here and there, but they might be pushed out of business with places like Sakanaya or Sushi Kame. Sushi Rock has a nice, clean environment with hip decorations and a kpop/jpop mix going on in the background.The sushi is alright, but nothing really special. It's better than Sushi Ichiban no doubt, but compared to other sushi joints, the price isn't worth it. The udon is nice and the broth is warming, so I would recommend that. Mine came with vegetable and shrimp tempura, which were delicious! My only complaint with dining in is that the service, while friendly, can be a bit forgetful and you have to remind them you need water or your bill so they know you're there.The takoyaki was awful and a total ripoff though. I was picking up a snack between classes and paid a little over $4 for four lukewarm, shriveled up ping pong balls covered in sauce and a little bit of green onion. They were soggy and the little octopus bit was chewy like a wad of gum and tasted bland. I'm pretty sure they're the frozen kind you buy at Asian markets and you can buy a large bag to microwave at home for a better price.Of course, it's conveniently located on Green Street so it's close to campus and convenient for hungry students who would rather forego the even more overpriced and poor quality of Sushi San in the Union basement.",

However, I don't feel the vague cultural distinction of the restaurant should detract from the quality food.FOOD:I usually get two items: 1) korokke and 2) sushi. I typically get the korroke, which is a japanese croquette. Living in northern Japan for 11 years, I can say that this korroke is EXACTLY like the korroke I've had in Japan (don't let the korokke websites fool you...the one I had in Japan had no meat in it). It's simply authentic and divine. The sushi is great, though I never get out of my comfort zone-- not because of taste but because of the price. Hey, I'm a college student with bills to pay, alright?SERVICE: I've dined in and have taken out and the service has been great. The people are friendly and warm If you are taking out and stay there while hey make your food, they offer you water, which is sweet! :)Overall, I have no complaints. I am a fan and will be dining there again!",

In short, I think Sushi Rock is great for those that love sushi that has a lot of raw fish in or on the roll. I was very impressed by how great Sushi Rock's sushi was. I ordered a rainbow roll and 2 other rolls that were similar (rolls with assorted raw fish on top) and I was shocked at how great the rolls were. They were fresh, a little creamy inside--simply incredible. I feel like the prices here are slightly lower than Kofusion and they also have a wider selection of sushi rolls. Again, as someone who loves the rainbow type rolls, Sushi Rock offers a lot of that variety at prices around $10-$13. They also have a very decently priced sashimi platter at just $10-11. That is CHEAP for any sushi place and I absolutely would have ordered this if I hadn't already had my eye on 3 other rolls. I'm not sure what their dine in service is like, but at least when I was getting take out, the hostess was great, offering me some tea, and when I declined ginger but mentioned I love wasabi, she made sure to give me extra wasabi at no additional cost. Also, some reviewers have questioned the restaurant for serving Korean food and not being authentic Japanese food. In short, sushi is not strictly Japanese fare and Sushi Rock is not trying to be a Japanese restaurant. *A lot* of sushi places are owned by Koreans and they really are a unique niche. One of my favorite dishes, hwe dup bap, is only served in Korean-owned sushi restaurants because it is specifically a Korean-sushi dish. So, don't expect authentic Japanese food here and don't be surprised by the Korean entrees. This is all part of the culture and cuisine of the place itself. CU has a lot of restaurants that are like this (in fact, I believe Sushi Kame is the ONLY Japanese-owned sushi place in town) so for those wondering, this is why you'll see a mix of ethnic cuisines.",

The atmosphere was pretty nice and it wasn't too busy.Sushi Rock is on a great location on Green Street near the bars and other ethnic restaurants. However, I found the sushi very disappointing. Sushi Rock was wayyy too americanized with the crunchy fried food and the limited menu. The menu consist of some of the usual Japanese dish such as rolls, gyoza, and udon, but c'mon... no sashimi and no nigiri sushi?!? What kind of Japanese Restaurant does not sell nigiri and sashimi? Sashimi is a Japanese delicacy, and California Rolls and Crunch rolls are so not Japanese cuisine. It's like saying taco bell is authentic Mexican food, sorry. =/I really wanted to like you, Sushi Rock, but it wasn't working out. I felt like I wasn't eating real sushi even though the presentation of each dish was pretty eye-appealing. The taste wasn't right. Maybe because I'm eating raw \"fish\" in the Midwest, but I've been to a couple of good sushi restaurants in the Midwest and sushi rock did not cut it for me.Also, our server seemed very forgetful and clueless. She took forever to pick up our checks and close our checks when the restaurant was not busy at all. Maybe she was a new server but I'll give her a star for being nice. Overall, I enjoyed my time with my friends but I did not enjoy the food.",

Green street sidewalks were packed with the crowd following a football game at which 60,000 people were present.  First words out of our server's mouth were \"You need to order right away because the kitchen closes at 3:00\"Are you kidding me? On so many levels that was wrong.  Stupid not to adjust kitchen hours to match circumstances, and stupid to greet us that way.  Its not like we were going to linger long in this semi-fast-food campus restaurant before we ordered, but now we really felt rushed.The food is usually good, I've been there several times, but this time the Chicken Teriyaki Bento Box was not great; the tempura veggies were a clump of greasy onions.  The Miso soup is a good addition and the spicy tuna and California sushi rolls we also ordered were decent but nothing special.The advantage to this place was the speed and value, yet it was clear the waiter was in a hurry. He was pleasant, but brought the food out as soon as everything came ready despite the fact that we were still having our soup when he set the bento boxes on the table.  An additional ten minutes might have been nice.  And he delivered the check without us asking while we were still eating.  There is a time and a place for that speed, like at an interstate truck stop.It gets three stars because of value, but it has a schizophrenic atmosphere.  Is it trying to be a nice place or is it the McDonalds of Bento Boxes?",

And the super dim lighting I guess is their attempt at creating a romantic ambiance?  But the fact you're sitting right on top of the brightly lit kitchen and/or right next to the constantly opening/closing front door makes it aggravating more than anything.$10 for a spider roll? Gimme a break.  I can get two rolls, and a bowl of miso soup from Sushi Avenue for the same price!  Plus, you don't have to tip at Sushi Avenue.So what does Sushi Rock have to offer that you can't get just a few blocks down Green at Sushi Avenue?  Mmm... maybe the fact they serve alcohol?  Even then.. meh.Don't get me wrong, the sushi here isn't bad, but it's nothing special either.  I just prefer the hands-off approach of Sushi Avenue.",

This place blows Ichiban out of the water in terms of service, sushi selection and aesthetics. The only drawback, in my mind, is that they serve tea in bags as oppose to a more traditional loose leaf variety.Bottom line: if you want sushi, come here. If you want a ton of chicken teriyaki for cheap and don't care about the crap service/experience at Ichiban, go there.",

Could lunch get any more divine?! This may not be the fanciest bar, but it has a warm, homey environment. Coupled with a friendly staff and delicious bae food, you can't go wrong. Their loaded fries are bomb and the fish sandwiches are definitely worth the waits. Lent is coming up, people, and this is where you want to spend your Fridays! You can quiet your Catholic guilt by indulging in the fish while drowning your overindulgence in favorite beers.",

Never any cover, Legends is ALWAYS crowded on weekend nights.And no reason not to; their drinks are cheap, space plentiful, and their pool tables are not slanted on the ground. A great place for happy hours, and just the occasional night out. Also, you cannot have a barcrawl if it doesn't go to Legends.If only they would stop repainting the exterior wackier and wackier every 2 years...",

We also really enjoyed the outdoor seating area out back. Oh by the way, next time you are there, order a Sex on the Beach. They have their own special way of making it....realllly good and I've never seen it done anywhere else!",

Legends is a pretty laid back bar where you can get together with friends and have a couple drinks.  Not really the type of place to dance, but there's Joe's and Cly's if that's what you're looking for.  In addition to Guinness on tap, they had a handful of other beers as well as a pretty extensive bottled beer list.  Prices were reasonable too, $4.75 for a Dead Guy and $4.50 for a Killians.  Another bonus was that the bartender serving me was very cute.  Definitely will be back in the future to grab a beer with some friends and watch some games.",

There beer selection is average at best recommend the Sams Adams octoberfest on tap a pint for 3 dollars or any leninkugels on tap.  They have daily drink specials, two dollar long islands on Thursdays, Friday yaegar shots 2 dollars.The food is your average bar food burgers, some wraps, wings, nachos, for fries have to pay 2 dollars extra.  The real annoying part of this place is the food is ordered at the bar than picked up by you when the number is called.  There is no hostess or waitstaff all self serve and first come first serve on tables.  You could be waiting hours for a table at this place recommend you get there at 6:00pm before the late night rush!!!",

Deluxe is no more but this structure sits on the burial ground of where Deluxe once stood.  i try not to think about Deluxe when i'm in legends otherwise i feel like i'm looking for my dead dog among a litter of perfectly fresh purebred puppies.  You kind of have to treat Legends this way, like a fresh puppy.  Grow with it, create your own tricks together, develop a routine, find comfort in it, know it's always there when you need it.If you can detect different ratios of pepsi syrup to carbonated water when you drink a fountain pepsi, i challenge you find a better ratio than what is going on here.  it's a science and they have the titration juuuuust right.  when i used to consume a juicy burger, this was my destination of choice.  now i thoroughly enjoy the greek wrap minus the chicken and still feel i have consumed enough oil to be guilty.  the fries are awesome too.  good university crowd to go along with all the university memorabelia on the walls.  nice staff primarily made up of college kids from the suburbs who always seem to smile and do their jobs well.  the fish sandwich still exists on fridays but i just haven't been able to bring myself to consume one...",

I've been there a couple of times to watch various sporting events, and I love how the staff will obligingly change the channel for you if you want to see a different game. However, the hamburgers are a bit weak. My boyfriend and I went there after the depressing Illinois-Penn State game this past weekend and we were starving. Admittedly we were drunk too, but we were immediately hungry after we ate our burgers. Also I don't think the burgers come with fries. We were a bit disappointed to see bags of chips. I do like the way you can put your own stuff on the burgers and all, and the toppings are nice and fresh. Maybe next time I'll order something else! I am nothing if not magnanimous.",

Legends is the perfect place to stroll into with a big group of people, as there's rarely a line and with the bar in the middle of the building, it's accessible from wherever your group decides to sit.No, you can't really get your dance on here, even though there's a lot of space...but if you're just looking to get a good buzz, you won't miss that.  The large area does make it enjoyable for happy hours though.Food's pretty good.  I like Murphy's burgers better, but I like the ranch chicken sandwiches and fish sandwiches from here.It's not the most bumpin' bar in Champaign, but it's the best place to come and chill with some friends.  Or roll in with a ton of people, take up a quarter of the bar, and do shots until they kick you out.  Either way.",

Really cheap, awful, uncoated, unshufflable, undealable, soak up beer faster than any paper I've ever seen playing cards, but playing cards all the same. My friends and I aren't smart enough to bring our own, so this saves us. But they lose a star for having recently eliminated the internet jukebox and added a DJ. How else can we play \"In the Air Tonight\" to kill the mood at 1am? We actually paid the dude a fiver and left him an iPod to get something played that wasn't part of the standard littany of horrible bar songs.",

Legends' best attributes are the many TV's available to take in the game and the space for people to spread out.  If you're nice and it's not too busy the staff might even put on the game you request.  It's not too tough for a few people to lock down a good chunk of space here which is what makes it a winner.  The patio is a decent size and appealing when it's nice out.The prices are about campus average and the tap selection sucks.  The main draw is coming here on Wednesday and doing the venerable \"School of Beer\" (which should be renamed \"Buy our entire bottle list\") which features more enjoyable selections than what is on draft and awesome prices ($4 max per beer, usually less).Definitely my go-to if I feel like drinking on campus without being heavily annoyed.  Also, if you look like someone who used to work here, current employees will ask to take their picture with you or stare at you from across the bar.",

The place is setup quite a bit like a restaurant with all the booths and tables in the place, and with waitresses that come around and try to get you to order more drinks. However, the burgers here are really bad: they seem to be cheap, frozen, store-bought patties that are generally overcooked and not so tasty.  Their prices don't make up for it either; who wants to pay $6 for a burger that is worse than McDonald's? The bar portion also pretty bad.  It's always hard to get the attention of the bartenders.  Once you do get their attention, you're likely in for some crappy tasting beer.  All the taps here taste a little foul; maybe they just don't know how to clean them?  The good side of Legends is that it's almost never crowded, and usually not too loud.  They also have a few projectors they use to show Illini games, so that can be nice.  So, if you're not too much of a beer snob, this isn't a bad place to go and knock a few back.",

When i went to school there i did them all the time and it was 2 dollars for a pint glass of anything on tap! little dissapointed it goes up each time i visit, kinda loosing the appeal of it. Their food is actually pretty decent. Not overly amazing but pretty good as far as bar food goes. GO EARLY. If you try to go on a ride the rail night and you get there late the line is insane and it takes forever to get a drink. The worst is when its all beer specials and you have to wait for someone to get their Margaritta or fruity mixed drinks. Come on its beer specials thats why everyone is here, move out of the way!!! this is def a day drinking bar.",

But it's my favorite and thus 5 stars.Great atmosphere, never overly crowded the way some of the other dumps on campus are, often you're able to grab a seat, even on some of the busiest nights. My favorite night was Tuesday nights - Ride the Rail, and yes I completed my rail card senior year. I've got my name up on the wall which is very cool but I've got so many great memories of sitting around having beers with friends. And, I have to say, the beer selection's pretty good actually. They always have a few good drafts on top of the normal college bar cheap, watered down stuff. Nothing elaborate, but good quality mass produced stuff - Sam Adams Seasonals, Woodchuck, etc.The food's surprisingly good as well. I would say Firehaus has better food, but as far as green street bars go, that's probably it. I generally stuck with burgers or chicken sandwiches and they have a good selection of toppings to put on whatever food you get.But you really go to Legends for the atmosphere. It's an upperclassman bar where you can go to actually hang out and talk with friends. They have good music playing in the background but it's never all that loud and it's stuff you want to listen to anyway. They've got some slot machines and pool tables now which also make for a good time and there's a dressed model of the Chief up front which is a welcome sight for any Illini.",

Their burgers are also really enjoyable. All of the toppings are self serve which I really enjoy because then I can add exactly what I like.

Bigger mistake.They came back from the bar after another 20+ minutes without drinks.  At that point we had been there for almost an hour and my alcohol dependency started to give me the shakes.We finally got the drinks from the server and asked for our check so we could leave immediately.  Despite saying that we could pay however we'd like and she just needed a card to \"hold\", she insisted on swiping the one card for the whole bill.  The reason: \"It's just too busy to bring you the check\".  If that was a busy night, I would hate to see what that place looks like when it's slow.  The icing on the proverbial cake was the *BROKEN GLASS* I found in my cocktail.  The server was disinterested in my future digestive issues resulting from the shards of glass and lurked over the table as we signed the check.",

They have a full bar and play whatever the current hits are at night, but no one actually dances sans a helluva lot of alcohol.  It's also a great place to go on game days as they have a nice, big, flat-screen TV, and plenty of booths/bar stools to crowd around, watch, and cheer for your team.  Go Illini!",

It really seems like they have everything here.I have yet to actually try the food, but I've heard the sandwiches are pretty good. They do have Hooked deals from time to time which is a nice touch.Overall probably not the most exciting or club-like bar on campus, not somewhere to go dance your brains out and make an ass of yourself. But, likely the best place to sit down at a more traditional style sports-themed bar, perhaps with your parents.",

No hassles from the locals, though, which was nice. In fact, everyone there seemed to be having a chill but fun time. The music was a tad loud, and the drinks pricier than neighboring bars (but still totally reasonable), but the atmosphere was more comfortable and the options higher end. I could see Legends being one of the better bars in Champaign to sit back with a drink and watch a game or hang with friends without worrying about a drunk frat boy spilling on you. Nice.",

But straying from those favorites might make you wish you hadn't. (Case in point, I had the grilled cheese with tomato and it came out entirely sopping with butter.) They do have an island, though, that offers up all the best condiments - make sure to try the pickles, they're out of this world! Food comes out fairly fast, though it can be unreliable in a party of more than two.  Food is always at the right temperature and they make french fries just the way I like them, crisp and not greasy!  Don't go to Legends to drink.  As a matter of fact, outside of a few places in town, I recommend doing your drinking at home (your wallet will thank you).  The prices are insane and watching them measure out your liquor makes it feel like you're getting shafted.  Legends is also not a place to go if you want to skip big crowds on weekends.  It's usually packed on game days (whatever the game), but it's also relatively quiet on weekdays, so it's ideal for lunch.  Plus, they also have a parking lot (one of the only ones off Green) and that makes it a real keeper.",

The building is new and the whole interior feels fresh and bright--just want you want when enjoying your breakfast.While I sometimes enjoy a \"luxury\" bagel (with crunchy cinnamon or other ingredients baked into the batter), I usually stick to more conventional flavors.  I love the selection of \"plain\" bagel flavors at Einstein: honey whole wheat, sesame, potato, pumpernickle, etc.  The bagels themselves are delicious, but the real silver lining is the schmears (flavored, whipped cream cheeses).  I swear by the honey-flavored schmear, subtly sweet with a sprinkling of almonds.Sometimes I stop in after work to pick up a batch of bagels for breakfast.  By the late afternoon, the display case has often been plucked clean by earlier crowds.  I'm not sure if there are more bagels waiting in back, but if so, I wish they'd keep their front case stocked.",

With that said, their food is of high quantity in comparison to many other restaurant establishments.

The bagel was untoasted, which was the only thing that I disliked (aside from the small size)--bagels are one of those foods that needs to be heated up...seriously...who eats untoasted bagels?Anyway, it was a pretty good sandwich but way too ridiculously expensive for the tiny size.  Wouldn't have been worth it at all if not for the coupon we had.  $7 for a small bagel with \"schmear\" (ughhh that word gives me the willies), some sprouts and a few veggies?  Seriously?  My boyfriend ordered a panini, also ridiculously small, with potato salad on the side, for $8.  The potato salad was pretty nasty--he couldn't even finish it.We also had iced coffee, which is probably the only thing I'll get from here in the future.  I dunno, maybe I'll get a bagel or something if I have a coupon but overall I felt like the prices just didn't make sense for the amount of food you get.  You can go to a nice local place and get larger servings of better food for the same price.They do have a parking lot, which is a plus, and the seating and atmosphere is nice.  Probably would be a decent place to grab a coffee and do some homework but I wouldn't really bother with their food.",

                "review": "I have always liked Einstein Bros Bagels; their \"Veg Out\" bagel sandwich is one of my favorite vegetarian sandwiches and their bagels are always delicious.  I have gone to this Einstein location twice early in the morning to get a baker's dozen and two \"Joe to Go\" coffee containers to provide breakfast at a presentation.  Both times I did not call ahead of time but each time the staff was quick, helpful, and kind.  I was worried they would have trouble accommodating my order since I basically walked in the door without notice but they had no issues.  They provide creamer, sweeteners, stirrers, coffee cups, and knives for the cream cheese.  They have a great system so that everything is organized and you have everything you need.  I also appreciated that they helped me bring the bagels and coffee out to my car.  The only downside is that the bakers dozen, two containers of cream cheese, and two big things of coffee (one regular and one decaf) came to $50 which is not cheap.  However, they have great quality food and coffee and when you think about all the extras they throw in, it is actually a pretty reasonable price.  I would recommend going to Einstein for anyone who needs a last minute spread for a conference or presentation!",

Yet over the past 60 days or so... the amount of lox on my lox and bagel, everything bagel, double toasted has been less and less... it's somewhat startling when you think how much money EBB will save by taking an ounce of lox here and there off of your sandwich multiplied by the number purchased worldwide in 24 hours.  i'm all for conservation but in this case, NIMBY.soooo, i brought it to the attention of the manager today... the ginger one.  and his first response was \"Really?\"and i thought to myself... no, i'm making this up so you and i can have a conversation, by the way, how's the wife and kids?  Yes, REALLY, otherwise i wouldn't speak up... NITWIT!!!while i'm thinking to myself, the manager says \"let me show you something\" and quickly exits to the kitchen.at almost the same time the server hands me my bagel. i choose to exit quickly having expressed my concern over the ever diminishing quantity of lox and quality of the lox and bagels being sold.by this time, i've already decided that this is my last visit for awhile, so as i walk out the door, instead of my customary \"see you later\" i said \"GOODBYE\"soooo, i get to work, open my lox and bagels... and sonofab*tch... they didn't toast my bagel!!!i'm done with EBB at this location.you can kiss this multiple purchases per week customer goodbye.",

I am spoken to by name by the majority of employees, and all of them provide great hospitality. The employees here are outstanding and friendly, and I am paying attention to how they treat new customers. There is no drop off in the kindness they show to between regulars and first time visitors. In fact, my wife and three boys all love this place too, even though they don't know their names!I have had breakfast and lunch here, and I have catered a breakfast using this location. The bagels are as close to a New York bagel that you can find in Chambana. The cream cheese flavors are excellent! (Try the smoked salmon on an asiago bagel!) If you were really pressing me to find something to gripe about it would be a minor item that I consider ultimately unimportant to the overall dining experience. That item is simply this. When I get coffee, the lids are on one side of the coffee bar and the cream and sweetener are on the other. Since I put the lid on last, I have to go back and get the lid, when I've got everything else ready to go. (I did mention it was an utterly unimportant non-issue, no?)So, trust me. If you are looking for a trustworthy breakfast place, Einstein Bros is where its at. The real secret that not many people know about is how good they are at lunch. Try the soup. Try a Thintastic Chicken Pesto. And tell 'em Sean sent you, and see what happens!",

We had a salad with a light cream sauce, tuna tartar, and two different flatbreads: pork belly and beet/white bean humus. We will go back. We had dinner outside. When we return, we will sit further from the street or inside. Neil street is pretty well transited and the traffic can be distracting. The service was very nice.",

                "review": "I felt like I was back in downtown Austin, TX or dining off of Randolph Street in Chicago, IL. This restaurant brings major city dining, service and ambiance to a small college town. Ambiance - The entire experience was spot on. From the moment we walked in, we were pleasantly surprised by the attention to decor details. Backlit stained glass windows, wine bar with lounge, reclaimed wood on walls, \"edison\" bulb lighting, short mason jars with candles on tables. It felt great being in the space. Getting a table - The hostess was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. Took down our number to call us when the table was ready. Said it would take 30-40 minutes, told us the group sizes ahead of us. 40 minutes later phone rang and our table was ready. We arrived around 7 - 7:30pm. They were getting ready to do their second seating. If you aren't going to arrive by 6, consider arriving between 7:30 - 8:30pm as things appeared to clear out a bit by then. Seating - We sat in a booth, which I love doing so I can sit next to my husband. There are a limited QTY of booths, thus if this is your preference you should consider putting in that request with a hostess early. If weather is nice, they have a lot of outdoor tables on Neil Street. Bonus - when Cowboy Monkey has bands playing (around the corner), you can get music for free!Service - I don't know if all waiters that work here are as talented and knowledgeable as ours, but as a previous server at a high-end restaurant while in college - wow! He was attentive, well-spoken, knew the menu inside and out (props to the chef for letting your servers try everything - it makes a big difference), and was super knowledgeable about wines (we are not). My husband had ordered a malbec, enjoyed it, and put in an order for another. The server told him he should really try another one by the glass and that he'd like it more -- which he did and was pleasantly surprised. Food - We were so pleased by our meal. For a starter, we ordered 12 month manchego cheese with 15 month-aged jamon (ham). It comes out on a butchers block serving tray with an assortment of warm and soft bread slices, date chutney, several hot peppers and an olive tapenade. Yum! We then put in an order for foccacia bread with chicken sausage on top and fennel. It's perfectly bite-sized sliced and great for sharing. For entries, we ordered shrimp with pork belly over grits. The second entre was scallops with crispy proscuito over perfectly tender potatoes. Management - The chef circled around to tables twice to visit personally with everyone. He was very gracious and attentive. Nice gesture!Props - It is also worth noting, they've only been open 2 weeks! The amount of work it requires to have a beautiful space, menu hammered out, well-trained and lovely staff and to provide a great dining experience so soon after opening is impressive. We were truly delighted with our meal and surprised / thankful to have a restaurant of this nature in Champaign!  Final Tips: 1. Put in your name and if it is crowded, go next door to Blind Pig Brewery or Quality for a pint. 2. Request a booth as they are more private against the walls. 3. Focaccia bread dishes are great for sharing. 4. Entres run around $18-$25. Plenty of options for wine by the glass and tapas too. 5. Don't be in a  rush. This is not churn tables out kind of restaurant. It is slower-paced and a relaxing atmosphere.",

Jen our waitress was fine, the issue was the very slow service both getting our drinks and our entrees. It was a nice night and the outdoor seating was very full and that was their excuse for the slow service. If that is the case then they need to add a bartender and another sous chef to handle the volume. We were inside and it was only about half full so they will be in real trouble if they pack the house.",

                "review": "WOW.  I love this place!I've been wanting to come here forever, but don't have a lot of people who are willing to try new places and new things with me.  I'm so pleased that I got the opportunity to visit last night.  The second we walked in, I loved the ambiance.  They had a little live music in the bar area that drifted into the dining room--so it wasn't too loud to talk and was just the perfect backdrop to a fun evening with a friend.  The pressed tin ceilings made the space feel warm and the eclectic art was well lit and positioned to draw interest.  But enough about the building--let's get down to brass tacks and talk about food and wine.You want an authentic local farm-to-table concept?  Go no further.  V. Picasso partners locally with Willow Creek Farm in Urbana and features Prairie Fruits Farms cheese on its menu as well.  They supplement with wonderful food items from around the world--they know an insane amount of information about where EXACTLY each food item is sourced and can tell you what makes it distinctive.  (Case in point:  One of their specials last night was a smoked venison osso buco that was described in incredible detail.  This place is serious about what they serve.)VPicasso has an amazing wine list with eclectic selections around the world.  They also offer 'wine on tap' which sounds interesting.  Our awesome waiter, Trent, suggested a wonderful Montepulciano D'Abruzzo that was light and not super acidic.  It's totally a new fave.Although the specials sounded AMAZING (osso buco?  you truly know the way to my heart, chef...) and the entrees looked fabulous (lobster ravioli? black cod? lamb shank?  risotto?) we weren't particularly hungry and wanted to just enjoy some of the wonderful cheese they offered.  (Major props to both the Manchego and the tangy Bohemian Blue)  The cheese board is served with fabulous honey from the farm, a yummy olive tapenade that was so good I thought we were going to get into a duel with our forks over it, and a jam in addition to lovely bread.  We ordered the roasted beet and arugula salad that had a perfect dressing on it that paired perfectly with the cheese we were eating (who knew!) and the shrimp toast.  It was fantastic.  Even though we were kinda full, it was too hard to resist the interesting desserts.  We landed on the chai funnel cake.  Seriously good.And call me crazy, but half of what makes or breaks a restaurant for me is service.  The staff was super friendly and easy-going and tremendously knowledgeable and professional.  I'm kind of a service snob--there are servers who do the job for the tips and there are servers who have restaurant in their blood and are actually concerned about the experience their guests have.  Chef Adam hires VERY well.So all in all, I'm more than pleased.  Don't you love Champaign?  Where else can you have all of this in the heart of your town?",

My wife sat down at the bar at 5:57pm (3 minutes left of happy hour) and ordered us each a glass.  The bartender said he would give her one... like he was doing her a favor. She was actually there earlier and was waiting on him.  He finally obliged and gave her and I one.  Later when we ordered our second glass with dinner it had 25% more wine in the glass.  So he gave us 3/4 of a pour.It was our 10 year anniversary and when they called to confirm earlier that day they said \"Is it true you will be celebrating your 10 year anniversary with us?, we have something really nice for you\".  Not once was it mentioned that it was our anniversary.  As we left the restaurant the hostess finally said happy anniversary.  I wasn't expecting much but dont call me and say you have something special for me and then just give me crappy service. Like I said, the place is nice. Just avoid the bar and hope for good service.",

Shrimp toast was just ok. My husband did not like it at all. Hence, our all hopes were on mains. Lamb shank was fine but it did not have any freshness of vegetables or salads to cut the richness of dish. On the other hand, duck had some freshness but was overcooked. Overall, it was just an ok experience. My overall ratings are below:Shrimp toast: 5/10Lamb shank: 6/10Duck: 6/10They have changed their menu since we first went there.

The waiter was the most friendly and helpful and conversational waitstaff I have ever encountered. And the food. Man. What a way to break from my campus habits of Chipotle and Torticas. A friend and I did two started and shared the entree and dessert. We chose the beef tartare and roasted bone marrow appetizers. It was my first time trying steak tartare and I was really pleased with it, though the potato chips that come with it to eat are a little overpowering for the tartare. The bone marrow is as rich and indulgent as you might expect, and well complemented by the toasts it comes with. Our entree was the grilled Berkshire farms pork chop and came with a side of cheesy macaroni and arugula. The pork chop was very substantial and somehow crispy, almost like it was fried. Very nicely done and the apple sauce is delicious made from local apples from Curtis Orchard.Dessert was a funnel cake drizzled with caramel and topped with whipped cream. So good! Definitely lighter than your average Funnel cake, and also super crispy and crunchy.",

He definitely exaggerated the size by at least double. I was given an appetizer amount of food that I finished in less than 10 bites.

I always give points to anyplace that takes time to create ambiance in our little bar town. Anyway, we had a super nice server named Ryan who suggested some good drinks. Ever since Boltini (RIP) closed, I've been searching for a good cocktail in this town. Hoping for a miracle, I tried two cocktails here. I'm happy to report the standout was the Martinez. It was flavorful without overpowering the palette with that gin tanginess. It does pack quite the wallop so make sure you're eating too. We also sampled some cheese and meats with the best being The \"Spanish\" variety: jamon Serrano and the manchego. I also tried the salmon flat bread which was red wine cured salmon with dill cream. It was perfectly light and left you with room for drinks. For a larger dining space, the noise was a low din. I'm pretty sure we were the loudest people there. This place is on the pricey side compared to the other restaurants in the area (my salmon and 2 cocktails was 25 or so) but it is well worth it. I'm looking forward to coming back on a date or just to try more cocktails!",

Of course between three adults we had 5 beers and 2 glasses of wine so over a third of our bill was alcohol...whoopsy ;) We tried the fried green tomato starter, pork belly flatbread, grilled chicken flatbread, and the cuban burger. All were delicious and quite filling. They don't' have a children's menu so the waiter was kind enough to ask the chef to make the Croque Monsieur into just a roasted ham and gruyere sandwich for my daughter on a pretzel bun instead with fries (a side option for all sandwiches) and they were more than willing. In fact we all had a bite and loved it! It was probably the best ham sandwich that little girl had ever eaten! Haha!",

From the start we loved the service with quirky, yet charming, 143 (aka \"Trent\"). We curated a cheese and meat board with the assistance of Trent. His recommendations were on point (loved the Prairie Fruit Farm Brie) and were paired well with the jams, honey (RIP the bees), and focaccia. Our meals were delicious. The linguine and clams had surprising kick to it and the squid ink pasta was so fresh! The risotto and salmon were also great choices. While the restaurant was out of all desserts, this place still gets 5 stars and I highly recommend it! Cheers!",

I've tried the malbec, tempranillo and the syrah and all are delicious. The cuisine is very charming-- especially the copper colored ceiling and the barn board-sided bar. The outdoor seating is also very pleasant--- particularly looking down Park Avenue into West side park. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly. I've repeatedly had great experiences there.",

I appreciate the decor and inner city feel of the restaurant, which is a welcome escape living in a college town. Definitely one of my new go-to restaurants in the area. Please note: the price point is a bit higher than other restaurants in the area and could be considered a downside for those on stricter budgets.",

First the food is interesting (always one of my highest criteria).  Two of us chose the \"cured dish of the day\", fried green tomatoes, quail entree and duck entree.  There was a bit of southern Americana bent.  Of the dishes, the cured fish was a bust from my point of view.  Wonderfully cured salmon, served with paprika whole grain mustard, tapinade, moderately spicy grilled peppers and grilled baguette.  If you put it all together the salmon is lost in the mix.  Don't know what it all had to do with each other but....Fried green tomatoes were wonderful not much more to say.  The quail was stuffed with a rhubarb. The quail was nicely cooked but as a matter of personal taste didn't like the stuffing.  Duck was wonderfully cooked over a corn risotto.Wines by the glass was a high point.  A bit pricey, but they had probably 20 wines by the glass or even for small tasting pours.  Choices were interesting.  We decided for wine pairings by the glass vs a bottle and were quite happy.So I think as the restaurant matures a bit it will be well worth it.",

The vegetarian lasangia was amazing and the rizoto was also pretty awesome - but a bit too much for me... So I'm happy my dish was the lasaniga :)Our server was very attentive and helped us to a great wine selection. It's important to mention that the place is a bit pricy especially for the tiny portions you get. Our goat cheese and arugula salad appetizer was super tiny - but super super tasty. All in all it's definitely worth a try. Especily since there aren't many great restaurants in our area that take their food seriously.",

I only say this because if you walk in here sober, your veins and arteries will immediately clog up by the mere smell of grease and you will probably go into cardiac arrest.That being said, Fat Sandwich is probably my go-to (drunk) place when I visit my friends at UIUC (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign). The combination of mozzarella sticks, french fries, mac n cheese bites, and every kind of greasy glory you can imagine on one bun just overwhelms me in the best way possible; and it never disappoints. It's also really nice that every one there is most likely just as drunk as you are, possibly even more intoxicated.My rating for this place while sober: I wouldn't eat here even if it was the last place on earth.My rating while I am incredibly not sober: fuck yeah let's get some fat sandwich.",

I ordered the Fat MILF, mostly because I'm immature and anything with bacon on it is probably a winner. I was not drunk  or high, just hungry.  Plus, everything else I wanted was closed and FSC seemed like the best remaining choice. As for the sandwich, it was delicious. It was a really big sandwich and took me quite a while to eat,  but I savored every bit of it. Obviously there are many people who wouldn't enjoy eating a sandwich filled with mozzarella sticks, chicken fingers, cheesesteak, bacon, and fries. I am not one of those people. $#!% was amazing. As I ate it, I felt like I was on Epic Meal Time. And that, my friends, is when I knew I found a winner.The only downfall was that it was just warm by the time it got to me. Still delicious, but it would have been even better if I ate it hot.",

It was a meatball sub with marinara, mozzarella sticks and fries. The upside, beer is cheap. $1.50 for a 312 bottle. Very surprised about that. And $1.25 for can of bud light. They actually ask for tips, which is strange and uncomfortable. Meh. Probably won't go here again.",

The food is for college kids who working through a hangover or need to load up for an all-nighter.  That said, this place does the job.  I stopped there after a long car ride from BMI airport.  I was starving so everything tasted good (though  also had to remove a good amount of the fries to eat the sandwich like another reviewer).  It did take a really long time to get the sandwich even though the place only had 1 or 2 other customers.   I had no problem with the bathrooms but I imagine they are in worse shape on the weekends after everyone's been out to the bar.They have rolls of paper towels at the tables instead of typical paper napkins.  I did have to use a lot of them after unwrapping my sandwich.Basically a 2 star type of restaurant; sandwich shop/fast food, but it does a 4 star job of it.  Good, but the food could use a little more 'engineering' to taste better vs just paying for a lot of calories.",

Cheesesteak, chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, bacon...it's all there.  I've got to say, though, that they may win the prize for best drunk-ass food on campus.  It is a bit more expensive than other options, and you'd probably need a heart transplant if you went here twice in one weekend (er...which is what I just did...), but it's undeniable drunk bliss.My only real complaint is that it also takes a while to get the food out.  Kind of makes sense when you realize all the different components they need to fry to make any of their sandwiches, but the long wait is made more painful when you're wasted and just want something to eat.",

They also have beer which is nice.  Contrary to other reviews on here I like Fat Sandwich regardless of drunkenness and in fact I usually go there sober.  I'd also like to point out that things other than the fat sandwiches are okay, but not the best.  If you're going to fat sandwich you should get a fat sandwich.  Or maybe a chicken donut.  It is a bit pricy for a sandwich, but one fat sandwich will keep me full for quite a while so I think it's worth it.",

There isn't much space to eat inside. I know that they're trying to go with the whole \"divey\" feel, but divey doesn't necessarily have to mean dirty. The least they could do is wipe down the tables after they're used. They blast really loud rock music which makes it quite difficult to have a conversation with your mates. it was interesting seeing a group of kids eating here considering that they have sandwiches called Fat Sororistute, Fat Motherclucker, and Fat Milf. I felt the best part of my fat sandwich was the mini corn dogs. Also, it's open at 3:00am which is great if you're having a hankering for munchies after some late night studying. Mmhm.",

It is impossible to leave this place still hungry that's for sure. The place is small and divey, which serves it's purpose perfectly. The menu is as over the top as you would expect from a place named Fat Sandwich, serving up everything from deep fried cheesecake, to a 20,000 calorie monstrosity known as \"The Big Fat Ugly\", to a bacon cheeseburger on a glazed doughnut. They also deliver beer-- every college kids dream-- and they're conveniently located right on campus.The bottom line is, the place isn't meant to be fine dining, it's meant to give you the most densely packed, calorie infused, cardiac arrest inducing food this side of the Mississippi. It succeeds and then some. Would recommend it to everyone at least once. Truly a local legend.",

As I stood there watching them prepare orders, each sandwich was prepared with care, as if they were fixing them for their selves.The price, compared to what you get is unbelievable..My advise is to either take a friend and split a sandwich or be really, really hungry. Or you can do as I did, make two meals out of it. The Sandwiches warm up real good in a toaster oven...So if you're tired of that hum-grum burger joint... Fat Sandwich is the place for you...  MamahlfA Very Happy SeniorPS... For all you 1,2,3, Star Raters... Please explain to me why you would go into a place named 'FAT SANDWICH\", THAT LIST FRIED BURGERS, FRENCH FRIES AND OTHER FRIED FOODS.. THAN COMPLAIN THAT THE FOOD IS GREASY, FRIED AND UNHEALTHY...

The sandwich is pretty much what you'd expect... it's chicken and a slice of american cheese, served in a glazed donut 'bun'. It's not particularly delicious, but hey, it's food.Okay, back to reality. You probably don't want that donut sandwich ever unless you ARE drunk, or maybe just curious and have a few friends to share it with. I was only there one other time and had the Fat Frat. It wasn't a BAD sandwich... but it wasn't very good either. That's the problem with having so many fried things on a sandwich. They all sort of melt together so all you can taste is the fact that whatever IS on the sandwich is fried. I will probably go back one more time ever, when my brother moves down for college in a few weeks. Ever since I told him about the place he's been jonesing for a sandwich with fried everything.",

I was under the impression I was getting a steak and cheese sandwich, what I received however, was a delicious endless abomination.  It was a gyro chicken tender and french fry sandwich, with a mozzarella stick packed in its behind for good measure.  What is this monstrosity?  I took one bite head on without modification, and nearly collapsed from the enormity of it.Eventually I slowly deconstructed this mammoth, first removing most of the french fries, after realizing the contents of the sandwich I decided to cull a few chicken tenders off the top, those had left me full enough to where the rest of the sandwich - which looked like a delicacy a few moments ago - was making me sick from how full I was.I debated packing the remaing 80% of it up and eating it for the next few days, or perhaps shipping it off to Africa where it could surely keep a small village going for 2-3 weeks.  However it unfortunately ended up in an empty bag of Doritos and then in to the trash.Fat Sandwich - I don't know what you think you're doing, but please carry on.",

Best sandwichs on the menu. Fat F, Fat MILF (best), Fat Sorastitute, Fat Cowboy, and a few others i can't recall. Worst are Fat Caesar and Fat Falafel, bleh those were nasty. This is a college staple and where you have to go if you have never been their before. Grab a six pack and drink while you wait. Eat it while its fresh it will turn nasty in your fridge. place is packed when bars close but empty just about any other time. Its super unhealthy but will sober you up in a minute. Good and Bad, at night they will take your name then call it when your sandwich is ready, BUT, they will ask you what you ordered. Its really hard to remember after a night of drinking so concentrate! They do it because people try to steal sandwiches.",

You basically can order whole menu items (like chicken tenders, an order of onion rings, a hamburger, or a grilled cheese sandwich as a TOPPING on your actual sandwich. \"May I have a cheesestake sandwich please, with chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, bacon, ketchup, and mayo on top?\" \"Why yes you can. One fat milf coming right up!\"You get the idea. So, as a place to add to your bucket list (next to \"bypass surgery\"), this place is a must. And the food is really good. I like the fries and rings and fingers (not sure I want them on my chicken sandwich), but who doesn't like them some fried, right?Couple practical considerations... 1) It's loud. Come prepared for bar-like atmosphere (the TV's up a couple notches higher than my old ears would prefer)2) All sauce-related toppings are slathered on in excess. I'd recommend all sauces on the side.3) It's hard to get cute college girls to notice you in the right way if you eat there too much. Just sayin'.But you gotta try it once!",

Charge upwards and onwards of acceptable prices.  Never, ever clean the bathrooms and in fact, add in artificial pee scents.  Watch money roll in.  Now let's be serious here.  This is reality.

My friend had been talking this place up saying it's totally disgusting but totally awesome (and right she was). She insisted we had to go AFTER the bars because I would probably want to murder her if we went sober. So we hit them up at about 2 or 3 in the morning; it was totally packed!I really don't know what I ate, because I just asked them for something without any meat so they hooked me up. Nothing on their menu is meat-free, so you just have to ask when you go in! It had french fries, mac n cheese bites, jalapeno poppers, and mozzarella sticks on a nice french bun. A culinary delight worthy of a michelin star, clearly. It was fun to eat once, I was clearly intoxicated when I ate it which made it even more fun, the staff were really happy to oblige our drunk selves with conversation while they made everyone's sandwiches. Everyone's drunk and passed out all over the place so the place is jam packed with college kids sleeping while their friend waits for their food. I don't think I would dine in at this place. Drunk people aren't clean people, and as such it's kind of icky on the inside because I'm sure the staff just can't keep up with everything. Oh, and no bathroom after 10 pm for anyone. Why? Because idiots ruined bathroom privileges for everyone by gettin' it awwwwwn in the bathroom. Kind of a huge downside when it takes 20 minutes or so to order and get your food.Will I be back? Probably not. Will I crave this sandwich again? Definitely not. Will I tell everyone I know about how disgustingly awesome this place is? Absolutely.",

Then name the sandwich after something that reminds you of a party school with serious collegiate sports teams, i.e. one sandwich is called the \"Fat Tailgate.\"I had said \"Fat Tailgate\" and yes, finished it all - every morsel of cheeseburger, mini corn dogs, ketchup and mustard - yes, while completely conscious at 2 pm. I had a gut trophy afterwards. It was beautiful. I also didn't want to eat for another two days.If you're particularly bold and want to impress me, I dare you to try their food challenge, the Big Fat Ugly.

Apparently if you eat this under 15 minutes, it's free.As for ambiance, it's typical for a grease spoon except that you can buy t-shirts.

The staff here is pretty cool, too.Without a doubt one of the least healthy places to eat in town, but worth a trip every now and then.",

They will be out of those items until next week. What kind of a manager is that? I ordered a \"specialty,\" a BMT. I got it home and sat down to eat. The sandwich was very tasteless, unless you count the nasty bagged lettuce taste when you take a bite. Why do restaurants use bagged lettuce when it's so easy to cut head lettuce? Shortcuts. And if they take a shortcut with something that easy to prepare, they take shortcuts on everything. If I get a bagged taste at any restaurant, it's my last visit,",

The guy working there was very nice and friendly and he listened to me as I changed my order a few times. The sandwich was good, though it might have been better toasted, and the bread is a little thick. However, any place that has a sandwich that includes both bacon and avocado is a winner for me. Also, I can get a dill pickle instead of chips. That's novel enough to give Silver Mine Subs an edge over the nearby Subway. It was a little expensive, next time I might not get the gigantic pop. Otherwise it was a very pleasant experience and I enjoyed it! I will be back!",

However, they're open late, and some of their pre-mades, like the Cripple Creek are just too good to pass up.  Double 11-in. sub special is their best offer.",

I ordered through campusfood.com 15 minutes before they closed and some sort of electronic delay resulted in my order arriving late, after they put all the food away.  The manager called me at 3:00 AM to tell me he canceled my order because they had already put the food away and were ready to close.  He then gave me a credit for the same amount that I could use anytime.  I ended up getting a free sandwich.  As far as the actual food goes, they have a good variety between cold and hot sandwichs.  I haven't tried any of the cold sandwiches, but they their hot chicken sandwiches are awesome.  The buffalo chicken sandwich has a mildly spicy buffalo sauce with a creamy ranch and melted provolone cheese on your choice of bread.  Definitely my favorite.  If you're in the mood for subs and don't want the conventional subway or boring jimmy johns, I highly recommend silver mine subs.",

Putting them above the crowd, however, is certainly the avocado spread, which pairs well with many of their sandwiches.  The prices are reasonable to a little high, but the free wifi is easy to access and very reliable, making this a regular stop for me if I don't want to go all the way down to Green.",

Well, there are no scary cross-eyed employees there talking on their cell phones instead of making sandwiches (as at subway.)  Instead there is a totally friendly crew of regular sub-makers, as well as a delicious and satisfying selection of subs.  YUM!",

Probably could get away without ordering an entree. If you've been to a greek owned family restaurant in the Chicago area, then you can kinda picture what its like here. Overall,  I'd come back, but it's nothing incredible.",

It was hot and tasty, as were the steak fries!I had a chicken salad sandwich with a cup of soup - the bread was a little stale, and the chicken salad rather plain - just chicken and mayo. We were out of there in under 25 minutes and for under $25.00 - will have to stop in and try their breakfast next time.",

The menu has a huge selection - something for everyone (unless you're eating vegan of course). There were about 8 of us and they had plenty of tables but for some reason, we had to wait 15 minutes for a table. When one of us asked if we could sit at the empty ones, they said sure if we didn't mind being split up, which we agreed to. When we were about to be seated, they asked if we wanted the tables pushed together (all of us were wondering why they didn't just do that earlier) but we said no, it's fine to keep them separate. All the food had that fake butter country crock flavor and the toast had huge slabs of margarine on them. Also, one of our waitress was considerably faster than the other which made our experience a little more strange since we were already split up at two tables.All in all, this place was one of those places that's so bad it's kinda good and when you're hungover, I'd choose this place over Merry Ann's any day.",

If you like a cheap meal or breakfast item this is likely the place to go. Also if you are eligible for a senior citizen discount, this is a great place to grab a meal. For everyone else, there is so much left to be desired. I don't care about the drab interior that reminds you of a restaurant from the 80s. If the food is good I am there. The prices are cheap for dinner and they have multiple specials everyday of the week. Today was 11.99 all you can eat bbq ribs or pasta. I took at pass an tried the grilled salmon for 12.99. A couple issues came up. First there is no warm bread with butter, you get a trough of saltine crackers so this is clearly wrong in the menu. Second you can chose soup or salad, I went with the soup based on the other reviews. The beef vegetable had a lot of veggies, but no pieces of beef another thumbs down. Finally the meal itself came without any other fixins instead a slice of tomato and lettuce. I have no idea how that goes with salmon. A couple of steamed veggies would have paired nicely. Salmon was okay, nothing special that you couldn't whip up at home. Finally that amazing pie that people wrote about, if you look carefully at the shelf, those are store bought pies. All and all this is a place for 10 dollar ish meal, but I think I might have been better off eating at a fast food restaurant. Pro: cheap breakfast/lunch/dinner, daily specials, seniors discountCons: store brought pies, no fresh bread with butter which is in the menu, borderline poor-below average mealsHidden gem:Daily specials. Check the website, although it does not appear to be updated and constantly shows a Monday special",

We always use yelp when trying to find a good restaurant in a new location - and when yelp gave us this restaurant as the #1 in the area, we were doubtful it would be right for us.  It looks like your typical family greasy spoon but we decided to try it because of the yelp reviews & we were hungry.  This is the only restaurant in the vicinity of at least 5 hotels but we quickly realized why.  The food came out in what seemed like 5 minutes and everything was fantastic.  My reuban came with a bowl of soup - chicken rosemary - huge chunks of real chicken breast and perfect flavor.  The salad bar was very fresh and had a nice variety of choices - you can order the salad bar instead of the fries but the fries are nice steak versions - which usually are served uncooked in the middle because they are too thick.  Not here - every one was perfect...and we all ate every one.  The service staff was very nice & friendly.So we went back for breakfast the next morning.  Again, everything tasted great and we had wonderful service and the prices cannot be beat.I would give this restaurant 5 stars but both times we were there, there were kids whining in the back ground.  Not the restaurants fault but it is a family style restaurant and as long as you can put up with a whining kid the whole time you are there, then this is the #1 choice in the area.",

Looking back, the only positive aspect of this place is the giant EAT sign.",

I came in here on a moderately busy Sunday night and ordered a, 8\" parmesean chicken sandwich, expecting it to be any regular sandwich that I buy a campustown eatery, but, my goodness, this was probably the most awful sub I have ever eaten. After mind-numbingly slow service (from payment to sandwich was 15 minutes), a visually appetizing sub came out, with chicken, mushrooms, onions, topped with a layer of melted cheese. As I grab the sandwich, the middle just starts dripping everywhere, and by the third bite, the bottom just falls apart. The rest of the meal was just a struggle to get the greasy concoction back between the slices of bread. I guess the food tasted alright, but it just takes away from the experience when you have a mess of food dribbling all over your hands. I come here to get a sandwich for a reason because it's easy and quick to eat. The fries, too, were just terrible. I don't think I even tasted any potato inside of the fried exterior. They were hard, bland, and unappealing! Perhaps this was just an off-day for them. I've had better at other Penn Station locations.",

The third time I asked for it to be made the old way and I asked this of an employee that I recognized as having worked there long enough to know.  Again, it was completely bland and tasteless, the new way.  I wrote to the management and explained to them that I didn't like this new recipe and even when asked to make it the old way, I received it the new way.  I told them that I wanted to see some kind of concession made so that I could enjoy the sandwich the way I knew it (which really was a simple change, but probably meant a bit more expense per sandwich, adding up to a lot if done with everyone).  They didn't reply to me, no one offered a discount for another sandwich because I had spent full price three times on what I believed was a sub-standard sandwich.  So, I'm not going back.",

The fries were fresh and above fast food standards.  Offering little packets of malt vinegar for the fries was a nice touch.  Service was relatively quick and friendly.  I give it three stars rather than four because four stars says that I'm a fan.  Much as I enjoyed my first experience there, I'm not a fan, just a satisfied customer.  East Coast?  Well, the sub I had, though good,  was certainly not up to the standards of a Sausage HERO in Little Italy.",

There was nothing sweet, plum, or berry about it, and certainly nothing flavorful enough about it for me to tell you if it was organic.  I want my $2.75 plus $0.50 metered parking fee back, thank you very much.In my less cantankerous moods, decent coffee (they carry Intelligentsia beans, but none of the supposedly godly Los Delirios), decent pastries, free wifi, but overall pricey as hell (something about the fees for green coffee going up).  Combined with the hordes of happy chirpy undergrads that frequent this place, I'll be taking my business somewhere else.",

They serve Intelligentsia, which is an excellent call on their part. It's one of my favorite coffees and the people working seem to know how to properly make their coffee as well. With some other unnamed local coffee shops raising their prices but still turning out burnt tasting and inconsistent espresso, this should really be your first choice locally.I've never had their food, but it has a good reputation as far as I know.",

College students monopolize tables for hours, so good luck finding a seat on the weekends and afternoons.  If you are not averse to meeting strangers, most people are willing to share their table if asked.Paradiso also can't seem to hold onto owners.  If you ever come here and feel slighted by the service, wait a few months and the management will have been replaced.  Each owner makes few changes to the menu, though you'll see their personal touches elsewhere (the current one seems to love those hand-painted, ceramic houses that grandmothers collect).In spite of its quirks, Paradiso is the best place in town for coffee and espresso.  They serve Intelligentsia Coffee, which is unrelentingly bold and rich; if you hold the coffee to the light you'll see that it is completely opaque.  After a cup, I usually feel as though I just had a particularly filling breakfast.Like most cafes, the food is bland and expensive, but suffices if you have managed to acquire a table and don't want to risk losing it by leaving for real food.  The best part of sandwiches is the bread, which is provided by Mirabelle (a fine bakery in Urbana).  Chips are usually smashed into a coarse dust before being served.  I've had the best luck with the pasta salad, though it is only offered in the summer and some of its variations are fairly terrible (any \"pesto\" version can be considered safe).",

Service is as bad as ever, which I used to be happy to overlook because the food and coffee were so great. Now the soups are being over-seasoned with heavy handed doses of curry powder, dill, and what tastes like artificial smoke flavoring, but ironically lack salt and pepper.  The vegetables and legumes are also usually undercooked (we're talking crunchy peas) while the pasta is overcooked and mushy. Their soups used to consistently wow me, but I can't remember the last time I had one that was even passable. Sandwich fixings are being poorly cut so you end up with things like half inch thick cucumber slices and bread of wildly different sizes on either side of the sandwich. Portion sizes are also shrinking to the point of ridiculousness, and the cup of soup for (i believe) $3.50 is becoming increasingly offensive.   Prices overall have gotten pretty nuts.  Today I spent over $12 on a half sandwich/soup combo with which I was given very little soup, a pastry, and a bottle of water that they didn't actually ever give me.  It was pretty much the nail in the coffin for my Paradiso lunch habit.Paradiso, please take note! You were once my favorite place for lunch and had soup so good I was willing to wait forever to get it. Please get your act together so I can love you again!",

I have not been able to find a coffee shop that I actually like.This may be because I'm outgrowing \"hanging out at coffee shops.\" I might also just be too busy, or more comfortable at home.At any rate - Paradiso is not just a cafe - it's an institution. Everyone who has ever gone there regularly knows this, and most can just sense it from being inside. There are some things it could do better with: some of the furniture is a little uncomfortable, sometimes the music is a little loud. At the end of the day, though, this place is a slice of your life in Champaign.I remember fondly the smokiness (although I no longer smoke), the cramped Rentertainment, the progressive expansion, the awkward open mic night experiments, the pasta nights, the yard sales, the employees, the friends I made and met there, regularly, day in and day out. I did a lot of growing up there and for good reason. It's a great environment. They really do most everything right. 1. Product: you can stand by product quality! Intelligentsia coffee, Mirabelle pastries and breads. Good business practice means knowing how to make money without cutting the wrong corners. The owner knows what she's doing.2. Service: baristas know how to make drinks! Seriously! This place has a hipster feel of course - but most of the hipster baristas I run across in Chicago are too busy trying to be cool and can't actually make drinks. The baristas at Paradiso are cool, and are competent at customer service and drink making. Again, the owner knows what she's doing.3. Environment: It's close to class, but not that close to class. It's close to dorms, but not that close to dorms. There's nice, tree-lined Urbana to your east. I heard lots of albums for the first time there. And there's a chance you'll make a friend or two. Not to mention, really comfortable bathrooms. I know that seems strange to say, but when you're on your 10th cup of coffee on a study binge, the bathrooms better feel right.I really should write more, but that would be more of a memoir, than a review. Just suffice to say, the place is great.",

Of all of the places in the Champaign-Urbana area (both on and off campus) they do cappuccinos best. Its smooth, the aroma and fragrance of the espresso bean is still there, and yes, they do foam art. They have a daily soup and they never disappoint. On a hot day you have the blueberry french soda. So creamy, blueberry-ey, and refreshing. Amazing selection of teas. They use intelligentsia coffee. The affogato comes with too much ice cream, though. You can also get a sandwich and pick the bread and ingredients. It's good but tastes like a regular sandwich, nothing special.Only problem is the cluttery and inconvenient set up. Simplify it! Too many tables and chairs. Oh, and the multiple surgeprotectors dotted across the floor are annoying. You have cords coming from multiple tables in that one surge protector which can be a hazard.

I think it's worth it, especially when I'm planning to sit for awhile and essentially renting table space. Many disagree.* The best time to write at Paradiso is during breaks or in the summer when campus empties out. During the semester, it can be loud and hard to get a table, and the internet is slow when there's a ton of students procrastinating by watching youtube.* The food is fine, but generally unexceptional.

The coffee is routinely overly bitter due to it being brewed with too hot water. They pre-grind beans and let them sit around for hours at a time. Finally, it's pretty clear that they are brewing a weak cup (not enough ground coffee per pot). On occasion I'll ask for the coffee of the day just after it has run out. They will start brewing a new pot and pour me a cup before the pot has finished brewing. Only then is the coffee even remotely close to its potential. I started ordering americanos in the hopes of getting something a bit more flavorful, but the aforementioned too hot water blew out the flavor of the espresso. The sandwiches are good, but inconsistent. Sometimes the bread is fresh, sometimes not. Sometimes they will pack the sandwich full of veggies, often not.Finally, the prices...I write this as I sit in a cafe in seattle where I just paid $3 for a perfect latte. $3 gets you a mediocre cup of coffee and that is not right. Paradiso, if you are listening, adjust your water temp, clean your water filter, up the amount of coffee you grind per pot, grind your beans fresh, and drop you prices by about 75 cents for your drinks across the board. Intelligentsia should refuse to sell beans to cafes that treat their beans so poorly.",

It was pretty much plopped on top and had the consistency of \"dish bubbles,\" which is not what you want when you're making a cappuccino.  I'd probably give Paradiso a 2.5 if I could because the sandwich i got there was pretty good.  But I was just so, so disappointed by the cappuccino quality that I can't give it a 3.",

The beans come from Intelligentsia up north and the difference in quality is very noticeable compared to the other coffee shops.  That difference is also reflected on the price you pay but the coffee is worth it.  They don't do single cup brewing, only big pots.  Thus in rare occasions, the coffee can be a miss (may be bad coffee ratio, bad water temperature, sat in the pot for too long etc...), Even then, you will still be getting the best coffee on campus.Their sandwiches are also good.  If you are hungry, feel free to build a sandwich from the big list of ingredients on the black board.  If it is a Tuesday or Thursday however, just get the Italian beef.  It is good.",

I love the collection of eclectic tables, chairs and booths in this space. This place is great for people-watching also. They have a few boardgames on a shelf near the bar. The workers usually play their own music, which works for me most of the time, but oh my goodness I went there one night where they were blasting Beyonce and Britney Spears. I should have said something, but I tweeted my disdain instead...I love getting the vegan soups there. So tasty and comes with yummy pieces of bread. It feels better since they give you so much in huge pretty bowls that also heighten the experience.Their sandwiches are huge and filled with lots of veggies.They make great flavoured drinks such as the mayan mocha (spicy cinnamon mocha). AND they use Monin brand syrup which is a huge plus for me because I do not like Torani and DaVinci is the worst. That's my personal preference.This place has the best soy mochas in my opinion. The mixture of the intelligentsia espresso and soy makes a great nutty combination.I almost forgot! They serve a mean affogato! Espresso, icecream, whipped cream, those tasty small almond cookies. I wish places here would do it like caffe paradiso instead of just giving me gelato and espresso.The pastries from mirabelle's are amazing. I recommend the alligator and bear claw.

The iced coffee was pretty standard, but I would agree with some fellow Yelpers in saying that I felt like paying over $3.50 for a pretty average cup of iced coffee was a little bit overpriced.  The decor was nice with marble tables, mismatched chairs, and interesting wall decorations. Something that I really liked about Caffe Paradiso was that it really attracts people from all walks of life with the majority expectedly being students; it made for some very nice subtle people-watching.  I think that it's a nice spot on the border of the U of I campus, but, in comparison to the other coffee shops that I've checked out in Chambana since arriving last week this one doesn't top my list.",

The sandwich was a little lackluster, but the fruit that came with was a nice touch, and the service was great.It was a great way to treat myself after having gotten an apt. today.  Woot.I can't wiat to keep my graduate student nose to the grind stone here. :)",

The thing is, when you're paying $5 for a cup of coffee you'd hope it would be consistently good. The food menu though is pretty useless if I'm going to be completely honest. By no means would I call myself a chef, but I cook enough to know that the ingredients and preparation of their food is definitely not worth the price. The sandwiches are priced at about $7 and they are nothing spectacular. They are literally something you could make out of oscar Mayer deli meat, county market white bread, a slice of cheese, a slice of tomato. The two times I ordered a sandwich it was grilled and came to me so crispy and crunchy you could hear throughout the whole cafe when I would bite. I've eaten carrots that were less crunchy. Because the coffee is a hot or miss, and because the food is a complete rip off I can't give this place more than two stars.",

When the cashier had to reverify practically everything, I thought she was just being thorough, but I guess I should have taken it as a warning sign. First we received the wrong size. Not a big deal, we just asked for the right size. Then, the woman who was handling the cashier poured the small drinks into the large cups, and then topped them off with an ample amount of soy milk, turning the drink into a completely different drink than what we ordered (think vaguely chocolatey coffeey soy milk). When my boyfriend went to ask her a question about the drinks, she was off-putting and didn't stick around long to talk (probably because she knew the criticism ahead). We decided it wasn't worth complaining anymore, so we left with our $5 chocolate soy milks and will not be going back.",

It looks more like a dorm area than a business.The tables and chairs are mismatched, which I'm sure is the style they're going for.  It would be cute if it just had something a little more to connect everything together, instead of a bunch of furniture thrown in.  It looks like left-overs from the dorms and frats that surround the area.  And it was sort of dirty.  Like dusty.  And the windows weren't clean.  And flies.  I can't stand trying to study with flies buzzing around me.  It's sort of the little things that can make a place be \"wow.\"  And the coffee was, in my opinion, rather overpriced.  Very good, but I was a little miffed at paying over $2 for a 16 oz. house coffee.  I guess because it's closer to the school they can over charge.  But my friend loves that brand of coffee, so we go there.I don't know, the potential is totally there.  It would be better if they kept it cleaner and more organized, and wiped the tables down on occassion.  But they do seem to have good hours - open until 11pm I think.

Kopi's is on par for comparison, but I think I like Pekara's more because it's served in a porcelain cup...something about it is more pleasant that way. The bakery is delicious, but the sandwiches are a little too salty/heavy for my taste. The same goes for the soups; tasty, but way too rich and creamy. That's a preference thing and I'm sure many people will like it, but just in case others are sensitive to textures, there it is.Overall, it's not a super-special kinda coffee shop, but for downtown Champaign, it does well, and its a local business with awesome staff that I feel really good about supporting. I also think it trumps downtown urbana shops by a long shot; looking at you Flying Machine.",

If I try and go on a diet, bread is one thing that I cannot give up. I love it so!!  Pekara is now my go-to spot for bread at the market. The wide selection of bread and baked goods immediately catches your eye. In a glass case, there are croissants and other goodies.  Next the case is a table filled with fresh baked breads that all look mouthwatering. I have purchased the Herb Focaccia and the Baguette.  Woah, both were amazing!!! The Focaccia had the perfect amount of rosemary and salt on it and it was perfect for dipping in some olive oil with parmesan cheese.  The baguette had a rustic look to it and had the right amount of crustiness.   It went great with the Italian Wedding Soup I made for dinner that evening. The gentleman at the stand is also very nice and I will for sure be a regular customer from here on out! Thanks Pekara!!",

                "review": "First, the things Pekara does well. I frequently encounter quiche with an unappetizing dense, crumbling texture, so I was absolutely over the moon when I discovered Pekara's quiche lorraine--instead of a piece of dried-out egg cake, the filling is so superbly soft and velvety that it literally melts in your mouth. At the Urbana farmers' market, I'll stop by their stall and pick up a filled croissant, which are always crisp and flaky beyond belief (not the sad, soggy pastries that croissants can sometimes be). I also crave their savory roasted red pepper and Gouda soup--but I bet they buy it packaged from some wholesaler as I've eaten nearly identical versions at several other places in town.Next, the things I'm not so happy with. One morning I decided to stop in and pick up some treats for my workplace's coffee hour. Thinking it'd probably be a good bulk investment, I opted for a loaf of the pumpkin bread, which came out to more than $10. I've been able to pick up a loaf at other bakeries in town for around $5, so I was admittedly shocked, especially because the bread was very dry and not particularly special in any way. Some of their baked goods are fairly inconsistent in quality--so much that I've sometimes wondered if they switched owners/bakers. Recently, they've made attempts to introduce some of the classic items you'd see in a New York Italian bakery, but unfortunately their attempts lack heart. It's as if some of the cookies weren't properly taste-tested before making it to the shelves.For Pekara, I'd recommend the savory items (omelettes, sandwiches, salads, quiches) over the sweets.",

I felt ridiculously ripped off, and was left feeling hungry.  Actually, quite a few of my co-workers with more money in their pockets ended up buying seconds just to fill their appetites.  It took a little while for the food to come out as well.  The sandwich wasn't bad, just very average and ridiculously overpriced.  Soup and salad were the same.   I'll be staying away.",

The plain one was good but the chocolate one had the bread all wrong.My son got a cheese omelete but it was kind of hard on the outside and he didn't like it.My wife got the chicken pesto crepe, which she said was good.We also had some samples of a brownie they had out on the table.  You order at the counter and they give you a number to put on the table and then bring out the food to you when it's ready.The location is nice (and there's an outdoor part out back).  Bathroom was clean.Prices are a little high but there are some less expensive items on the menu.  Nothing really wrong with this place, I feel like there's more on the menu to try and I'll probably find a favorite.   I will probably end up checking it out again if I am in the area after I have tried a few other places on my list first.A 3-star type establishment.",

Besides amazing pastries, they have delicious sandwiches. The Cuban and Hot Chicken sandwiches are my favourites. Omelettes & crpes are meh. There's a decent selection of fresh bread too. I like the jalapeo cheese pretzels & ciabatta when they're available. The baguettes have been hard & stale on occasion. I like to go in for an espresso & a sandwich before I work night shift. I get a pastry to go or pick up one in the morning when I get off work. For ambiance, there's a rotation selection of artwork. It's often loud inside & not conducive of conversation. The baristas are sometimes attentive & sometimes they just ignore me until I flag them down. All in all, I like their pastries & some of the sandwiches, but it's not my favourite place to hang. This place is kinda hit or miss.",

My favorite soups are the tomato and red pepper bisques, and they've gone out of their way to heat some up even if it's not on the day's menu which is really going the extra mile. I've had their turkey, blt and mushroom sandwiches and all were very tasty. Their breads are really great, too and you can't beat the price for a half soup and half sandwich at lunch. The best thing are the portion sizes! When Penara or Atlanta Bread Co. give you a half sandwich it's more like a 1/4 sandwich. There are times at Pekara i can't imagine how large a full sandwich would be! I haven't tried much of their baked goods but they look amazing.",

But...Baklava was dry, squished, and tasted stale.The crepes almost tasted raw and was almost rubbery to the texture.But the worst travesty was the Turkish coffee they had, which isn't really real Turkish coffee. They put a tiny cezve and the cup on a large plate; in reality they should be serving it already in the cup with the grounds already settled, without the cezve; there should be an accompanying glass of cold water (without ice), and finally it shouldnt be served with sugar cubes. The only way to truly sweeten Turkish coffee is during the brewing process when you are heating the cezve over the fire. Which means they should ask you how much sugar they want upon ordering it. Even were I to ignore this blatant trampling on the etiquette of Turkish coffee, it just tasted like incompletely made Nescafe put into a cezve and served lukewarm. Distinctly under-average establishment.",

I don't understand how they manage to make everything so plain and unappetizing. I ordered a \"ham and cheese melt\" that had ham and melted cheese on sourdough. The sourdough was vaguely stale and warm, but it was not clear that it had been toasted. The cheese had been melted on the bread, not the meat; there was a single, sad slice that didn't even cover all of the sourdough. The ham was overly salty, cut thick. Nothing else comes on the sandwich -- the bread isn't clearly buttered, pressed, or anything. No condiments. Just generally unappetizing. In retrospect I should have asked for a refund.This is the most recent sandwich disappointment. I don't think I'll make the mistake of getting anything that isn't pure sugar again.",

Hardly any foam. and then, i wanted to try something sweet so i ordered a cannoli. yeah. could not have been more disappointed. I paid almost 5 bucks for a small cannoli and it was like paper soaked in water. very heavy in texture. Could not finish it.

On my last day I also tried the breakfast sandwich on a sourdough bagel. The bagel was toasted to perfection and delicious but the sandwich could have used an extra couple slices of bacon. I bought a loaf of bread to take home...thankfully, they have instructions on how to keep your bread fresh for the longest period of time, as their breads do not have preservatives. Highly recommend this place!",

Outdoor patio has a perfect view of one of downtown's nicest art deco buildings.Only caveat is the prosciutto crepes...I don't know what type they are using, but it is not the appetizing Italian variety. In fact, it was so unappetizing, that I have downgraded my review. I love their other items, but that experience has made this place less desirable.",

It's nothing fancy: you order from the counter and they bring the food to your table. They have a pretty wide selection of sandwiches (warm or cold), salads, pizzas and crepes. I went for the smoked salmon pizza, which came with cucumber and dill cream cheese... a somewhat unusual and unexpected combination, but it wasn't bad and it was pretty cheap ($8 or so?). I'm guessing this might be better place for lunch than it is for dinner. I'll probably give it another try sometime soon.",

It is one of a very few that actually MAKE their food, including breads, baked goods, crepes, soups, sandwiches, individual pizzas, and salads, in addition to coffee drinks.Pekara has now moved its baking operations to its own dedicated building (now that says something for a local successful biz, doesn't it?) to do more wholesale for local retail establishments (for example, you can find their bread at Common Grounds Food Coop, cookies at the Latte Da coffee shops in the public libraries and Carle on Windsor and baked goods at Pages for All Ages independent bookstore.I like their niche; the desserts are homey, yet professional (and they can do higher level European cakes and pastries). They have THE best spanokopita-type dish (much better than Greek versions-more like a spinach/cheese custard in filo), lovely cupcakes, great combos for soup/salad/sandwiches, and savory croissants. Oh, and did I say individual Babkas? Seating is a smart row of two chair/table setups with plenty of outlets down the hall, with a counter/bar stools in front, and larger table combos, couch/club chairs in the back. Warm weather brings a couple of tables in front, and a bricked patio in the back. The only problems I have seen are: parking (now w/the road closed, but at nights and weekends you can use the bank across the street), and sometimes poor staffing (the owners cannot be there 24/7) although this is to be expected with the high turnover of food service jobs. I have noticed that the past six months have gotten better with a couple of 'managerial'  level employees who are keeping the staff professional. This is a casual, nice place to bring someone for lunch, breakfast, a bit to eat in the evenings, to study, etc. It is not a sit down restaurant, and it can sometimes get complicated if you are eating with a group of four or more and you want to pay the bill for everyone (getting the orders in and together).  Lunchtime can get a bit crowded. Each person orders individually and the staff brings you your meals. The food arrives quickly, even the made to order crepes. They do nice box lunches, catering, and platters as well.",

We were there a little early and said emphatically that we wanted coffee and it was our first time there, and were met with silence and attitude.

The girl working there apparently confused \"lemon and cheese danish\" for pumpkin and cream cheese muffin, which she stated they did not have. So I repeated the order, and she got to work. It didn't take too long to get the crepe (less than 5 min), but when my friend ordered, I went up to the counter with her and the girl asked me \"if she could help me\" to which I replied no, I was getting water and talking to my friend. That girl had a serious problem with apathy and attitude. Later, she climbed up into the visible \"attic\" storage and THREW things down (like paper towels, boxes, etc.)The prices could be better, but it was around $12 for a crepe, a pastry, and two cups of coffee. The crepe was really tasty and the coffee was good too, but the pastry was nothing special, I've had better at Panera.",

Upon entering, I was greeted by the friendly cashier. When I asked for her recommendations she gladly offered a variety of her favorite treats and then gave me adequate time to decide what I'd like to try for myself.After much deliberation, I went with the scotch oatmeal cookie that the lovely cashier recommended along with an iced coffee. Just a heads up for anyone interested, their oatmeal cookies are the real deal, made with shortening and lots of love. So while the cookie was the perfect balance of \"crunchy AND chewy\" that the cashier promised it would be, this treat definitely serves as a more once in a while splurge in my book. There were a number of other delicious looking pastries, tiramisu, and cakes on display; it really was tough to choose!My total came to $3.25 which I thought was extremely affordable considering the use of local ingredients and the fact that, at some other coffee shops in town, you'd pay that much alone for a cookie or a coffee separately.I thoroughly enjoyed my cookie, but I also just really enjoyed the space. The noise level was prime for sitting down and getting some studying and busywork done on a lazy Friday late afternoon.The combination of friendly and accommodating staff, delicious products, and the cool bakery/coffee shop ambiance give Pekara a thumbs up in my book. I definitely hope to be back in the next week or two!",

The interior is clean and there is decent amount of space without some outdoor seating. Cashiers were nice and friendly.We enjoyed two crepes, a quiche, and a soup for breakfast. I really liked the quiche here. It's more eggy like an omelet but it was very aromatic with the bacon on the bottom. I think I ordered the Florentine quiche? The crepes are nice as well. It's not a very thin, delicate crepe, but I really liked the sweet cream inside along with the fruit. Its stuffed with the cream and what's nice is that it wasn't too sweet and it had a hint of acidity. I would skip the tomato soup with gouda here. It was too heavy in my taste - almost like a sauce. It does come with a lot of bread though.With it's price point, I'd definitely want to come back when I have the chance!",

They have a daily array of yum yums that may include some of these: bagels, danish, bear claws, turnovers, cheesecake, cookies baklava(excellent), tarts, tortes, fruit/nut bars, quiche, rolls, and much more. Every one of these that I have tried has been very good.They also have really good daily soups (with surprisingly high prices) and good lunches. Their lunches are pretty expensive for what you get, but all sandwiches come on their awesome bread. They make crepes here that are pretty good, but again, the prices are pretty high for what you get. It can get crowded at lunch time, also. They have staff to deliver the meals to your tables after you order at the counter.Coffee comes in little (one size) cups and is often weak. Get your coffee next door at Aroma, people bring product from one cafe to the other all the time.It may seem like I am way too down on this place for a 4 star review, but for what I am looking for (pastries!) they are solid.",

I also like the random assortment of mugs that you get to pick from.They just got bagels here!  And they look like the real boiled thing!  Who else understands how big of a deal this is in urbana champaign?  The hours of 7-7pm also make it perfect for a real breakfast place. Free wifi and the fact that it's relatively empty on weekdays (unfortunately for them) makes it a fantastic place to work or power-study.  The caffeine + excellent sugar filled pastries keep you going.",

I keep trying because I like the atmosphere more than Aroma or Kopi.  But, the wireless is always spotty. Most recently, last Friday night, the wifi wasn't working at all. We talked to a staff member, and she tried to reset it, but it never ended up working, and we ended up leaving.  The frustrating part is that we had made several purchases, were clearly there to work, and there was no indication prior to ordering that the wifi was having any problems.  I think that in these cases, if wifi is faulty, customers should be given notification before they settle in. This has happened at least twice now.I ordered a pumpkin latte, which was tasty.  The sugar cookie tasted too much like almond extract for my preferences.  I prefer purer tasting sugar cookies.I might return to Pekara in the future for bread or to have a drink when I don't need the Internet to work.",

Still, I can't help but think it was lacking something. The soda was also a bit flat. I will say that the french baguette was delicious, and I like day-old bread, so it's great for that.",

I would highly recommend either of those sweet crepes if you are fiending for something savory and sweet for breakfast (or any time of the day).Overall, it's a nice little establishment to stop in and grab a bite to eat or grab a coffee.

So this morning came in expecting a delicious meal; because the cookie I had the night before was homemade (plus on Monday's they give you a free chocolate  chip cookie with your purchase). So this morning my omelet was good but the butter croissant was tough. The coffee was good. The tab came to $17; a bit expensive. But I was still thinking a 4 star would be an ok rating for this caffe, that is until I asked for a coffee refill and the women attending the counter said there is a $.50 charge. I read in the menu that is posted on the wall, that  you can have a espresso shot for $.30 added to your cup of coffee. Up to this point I was still ok with their way of conducting business (although it made me appreciate coffee shops in California that refill at no charge). However I had to take the rating down to three stars because once I asked for the refill and a shot of espresso the woman attending the counter said I would have to buy a new cup of coffee. If the owner of this coffee shop reads this review, please note you should change the writing in the large menu  written in the wall and clarify the coffee refill situation. The customer service was also inconsistent the first time (night) I came in to buy my cookie the gentleman attending the counter was great. The next morning I order my $17 omelette, croissant and coffee a nice African American lady took my order. But the woman with very short light brown hair was not customer service oriented when dealing with my coffee refill issue. I came in happy to be a return customer but left not sure if I would return.",

It has bits of white cheese (I'm still trying to figure out what kind, but it's sooo tasty!) and berries in it that set it apart from other tuna salads. Paired with a fluffy, buttery croissant, the combination of flavors is wonderful!I have also had the red pepper and smoked gouda bisque, which has been on their specials board for a couple of weeks. So good! And it comes with a generous helping of fresh bakery bread.The only thing I didn't entirely enjoy was a mango smoothie.  This is mainly because it was quite pricey for the quality IMO, since it was made with pre-squeezed mango and other juices from a container, versus using real, fresh fruit.",

I was elated to see that they had filled croissants like spinach and cheese, ham and cheese, and mushroom and cheese. I ordered the ham and cheese with a cup of cocoa - but they mistakenly gave me a mushroom and cheese croissant. I did not complain since I am an equal opportunity eater, but I know if I brought my friend here who is deathly allergic to mushrooms, well, it would have been bad.The croissant itself was beautifully flaky and tasty - not rubbery store-bought crud. I also like how Pekara prides itself in not using preservatives!However, the cocoa was awful - entirely made of Hershey's syrup that congealed at the bottom of the gigantic mug. At least the drink was beautiful.I know I'll be back, but just for the food. Additional tip: They sell half price day old bread.",

But when it's bad, it's terrible.I've had a multitude of mixed experiences here, both in service and food quality. When the baked goods are fresh, some of them can be outstanding. But when they've dried and/or gone stale and they're still selling them, it's like throwing money in the trash. (And sometimes when you ask what's fresh and you get it, it's still sub par.) The bread leaves something to be desired--I do not go here for their bread items.Pekara is not an inexpensive place to eat, either. Sometimes the service is fast and friendly and other times it's indifferent and slow. While most local businesses have a policy for a minimum spending amount to use a debit/credit card, most shop owners will still let you use your card if you're out of cash and making a purchase. Not here. I was thirty cents below the minimum and had no other means of paying for my purchase and I did not want to add on another $3 item, so the cashier took my item back and I walked out the door. It just baffles me that they'd rather lose a sale/customer than let you use your card for a $2.20 purchase.In sum: hit or miss. Could be top notch with a few changes, in this reviewer's opinion.",

Especially the vegetarian options. And all the pastries and baked-good I've had are delicious.There are a few tables out front and a patio in the back if you want to sit outside. In the back, they have a couch and an armchair and a taller table that works well for small groups.The only weird thing is that they don't bring cutlery out when you order the food so unless you think ahead, you have to walk back over to the counter. Not a big deal, but it would be a nice thing for them to do.",

My boyfriend's salmon burger was pretty good, but served on bread and not a bun, which was kind of odd.  I also had the English Orange iced tea, which was refreshing and a little sweet without being cloying.Our waitress had a major stick up her ass, though, which is why I'm downgrading them a star.  Bread Co., why must you hire rude people?  More often than not, the people working here are gruff and disdainful of the customers.  I get it, you're too cool to smile.  I'm not asking for a hug at the end of the meal, all I'm looking for is service without a scowl.",

I had read many reviews of the restaurant and entered with some trepidation.  My party had a reservation for ten people at 6:00pm and I was in the last group to arrive - a little late. The other guests were already enjoying a drink while waiting. The service and food were both outstanding. Our server, Nick, was prompt, polite, and knowledgeable.  Everyone's food looked so good. I ordered a vegan pasta dish with vegetables, which was excellent.  My wife had one of the unique pizzas and enjoyed it thoroughly. I noticed that at the end of dinner all in our party had left nothing on their plates.  We were all full happy campers! Only one member ordered dessert - chocolate mousse. He said it was great.We were finished with a leisurely dinner and had our bill paid with more than enough time to stroll down the block to see our play. The only negatives were bread that was a bit burnt due to what appeared to be a hot spot in the oven and the meals which were delivered to the table one or two at a time, which seemed a bit odd. However, the overall experience was enjoyed by everyone, making for an excellent prelude to the play. I will definitely come here again.",

They're usually a soup and sandwich place during lunch, but for dinner they completely switch up their menu: filet mignon, duck breast, tapas, and fondue???  On CAMPUS??

The food is so good, there is really nothing the servers could do to keep us from coming back. My favorite meal in the world is the cheese fondue (sometimes with the tomato puree), one of the yummy pizzas (preferably with brie), followed by their chocolate fondue. (I think I have strayed from that formula once, I can't remember what I ordered)I didn't think it was possible, but last night, all three of those items were better than ever. We had the cheese fondue with the tomato puree this time, as well as the pesto, portobello mushrooms, artichoke hearts and brie pizza - it was amazing.The chocolate fondue came with more fruits than I remember in the past, red and green apples, pears, strawberries and some yummy little cake pieces. The best meal I had all year.The service was excellent.",

My husband and I usually share an order of cheese fondue and a gourmet pizza.  The Bread Company offers a nice selection of wine and beer, including wine by the carafe.  I can't forget to mention their selection of fresh baked cookies.  The sables and chocolate macaroons are delicious.  Great atmosphere, delicious food, and reasonable prices - I love this place!",

The Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, though, was aromatic and worth the extra charge (though it's reasonable to expect that the menu had listed the price or the waiter had known it after I asked: no luck on either).I waited much too long to place my order after sitting (and it was not busy).  But the prosciutto and gruyere omelet (which I added spinach to with no problem) that arrived vastly exceeded expectations: it was flavorful, chock full of good ingredients and not overcooked. The pan-fried potatoes were spiced but not overly salty (though I sent them back when they arrived with a huge dollop of unmentioned sour-cream--ew).The baked bread was sourdough and crusty and a perfect accompaniment. Nice job, Bread Company. Great food. Lacking final star only because my waiter could have used some some further training on the menu and service timing.",

Embarrassingly, I've heard some job candidates comment that they were taken here for 3 different meals during their visit!  My department is probably at fault for their lack of imagination when choosing restaurants, but The Bread Company offers some benefits that elevate it to a top pick for business-casual university diners:(1) Location.  For people who have short lunch periods and need to be within walking distance of campus, this restaurant's location is unbeatable.  (And since it's next door to an Espresso Royale, you can grab a coffee after your meal, if desired.)(2) Atmosphere.  Most college restaurants resemble a McDonald's Playroom for adolescents: neon walls and heavy-duty plastic furniture, with underlying scents of urine and vomit.  While The Bread Company does have a hint of grunge, it also invokes a strong sense of urban, artistic chic.  There are real paintings on the wall (not poster prints).  At night, they bring out white tablecloth and mood lighting.(3) Price.  I think the prices are reasonable depending on who you ask.  This place IS pricey when compared to most campus restaurants, where students are always trying to squeeze their dollars.  Lunch generally runs around $7 to $10, which is not unreasonable when entertaining guests.  (And still comparable/cheaper than what you can get at Timpone's, the other \"nice\" restaurant in the area.)All of the food is fairly conservative, with obvious combinations of flavors (brie + portobello, turkey + pesto, etc.).  I think this is also a reason that it ranks highly among options for guests; you will find nothing offensive here in terms of food (but also nothing exciting).  The presentation tends to be elegant and you can tell that most of the ingredients are of good quality.For lunch, I always go with the egg salad, which is creamy, well-seasoned, and always satiates my craving for egg goodness.  In the early evening, sometimes I stop by for a beer and appetizer with friends.  The cheese selection is quite good (you'll find Stilton, Gouda, Manchego, etc.), and the beers are all microbrews (if you're into that kind of thing).  Dinner selections include fondue, pastas, pizzas, and some specialties, but the prices are on par with more interesting restaurants in downtown Champaign/Urbana.In terms of baked goods, I am quite fond of ordering my sandwiches here with sourdough or rye bread.  Yum!  At most places with a baking reputation, I always find myself enticed by the sweet buns and cookies, but I almost never find myself tempted by the ones at The Bread Company.  Their treats always look colorless and hardened, as if they were made by an angry grandma.Overall, I'd recommend this to people who like simple, light food.  If you are cheap and don't care about indie street cred, you could probably get the same food at Panera.",

Horrible destination for dinner.The lines are long and the sandwiches are pretty decent at lunch time, and it's certainly worth a try if you've never been here before.I've been in twice for dinner and was very disappointed both times.  The first time I was here, the place was dead and there were maybe 2 other tables seated.  The other time was for Valentine's Day (stupid, I know), and the place was packed and seriously overbooked since they apparently had given reservations to everyone who called and asked for them.Both times, the service was very slow and the staff was *extremely* rude, to include elbowing and pushing customers during the crowded V-Day fiasco, which I found inexcusable.  The quality of the food was poor, the servings small, and the prices high.  There were definitely some interesting looking recipes on the menu, but the quality of the ingredients was very substandard so nothing tasted very good at all.  Produce is not fresh and all the fruits and vegetables I had on both occasions were over or under ripe and clearly prepackaged.  The first time I was in there, about 3 different entrees were ordered before we picked something they weren't out of.I only went back the second time for V-Day because I wanted to try out the chocolate fondue.  In addition to being waaaaaaaay overbooked, they were understaffed and had a limited V-Day menu that was basically just 6 or so items from the regular menu with the already high prices about doubled.  Portions were so unbelievably small that even after spending $75+ on dinner, we had to go to LaBamba's afterward because my husband was still really hungry.  Seriously, he was served a piece of lamb that was roughly the size of a sliver dollar and probably could've been eaten in one bite with a little effort.  Total time in restaurant was in the 3 hour range due to the poor service and inability to seat in accordance with reservations.  The chocolate fondue was served in a beat up saucepan that had something crusted all over the outside of it.  Chocolate itself was actually pretty good, but the amount of stuff they gave us to dip in it was staggeringly small and the vast majority of it consisted of bananas and apples that were overripe to the point they couldn't be eaten. Although it was fondue for two, there was only one piece each of the more high quality dipping items (cookie, strawberry, etc.)I will certianly not be back for dinner and probably not for lunch either since there are a variety of other lunch places in town that are just as good or better that are easier to get to, Paradiso in particular.",

If you think that the reason why they are selling out of different entrees at dinner is because of poor planning, it is obvious that you have never worked in the restaurant industry.  Dishes sell out at the Bread Company because they are popular...duh!  There is no way to predict what will sell what night, and if you are upset that dishes are out of stock, you should be showing up earlier to insure that they still have their full night's supply.  As for the service being poor, it's true: the servers are mostly college kids that could give two shakes about their job, but the food is so incredible, it just doesn't matter to me.  The head chef, Daniel is honest to God a pure genius when it comes to creating new dishes and I never order off of anything but the specials menu.  Trust me when I say trust Dan with your dinner.  If he has a hand in creating it it's bound to be amazing.",

It's such a shame because their food is not bad, but the service is so badly below standard, I decided I am simply never coming back here.There is one particular worker with tattoos on his arm who is very insolent towards customers, raising his voice at them for asking questions.For months, I've ordered a grilled sandwich to pick up for lunch time, and the result is totally random. If the owner (tall bald guy) is there when you call, chances are you'll get a good sandwich with the potatoes and salad on the side, but if he's not there, watch out: there's no telling what you'll get. Sometimes they include potatoes and salad with the sandwich, sometimes they don't. Sometimes they slice the sandwich, sometimes they don't. Sometimes the sandwich is available since the grill is on, and other times it's not even available since they turn off the grill in the middle of the day to save money randomly.Today for example, I went to pick up my grilled sandwich to-go, and was surprised to see that on this occasion there were no potatoes and salad included, even though two weeks ago I ordered around the same time and they were included. So I asked the short-haired lady in front of me behind the register, \"are there potatoes and salad?\" (pointing at the sandwich) and she stared directly at my eyes without answering! So I repeated the question and she stood there completely quiet, staring at me without answering, when the tattooed arm punk butted in our conversation, cocked his head at me and yelled, \"didn't we go over this already?!\" Don't bother coming here. Unless the owner fires some of the incompetent and insolent flunkies buzzing behind the counter soon, this place needs to go out of business ASAP.",

They have vegetarian options, that are okay, more diverse than many places, but the few times I've been there, the salads needed a little work.  It is a-ok to tear the lettuce up a bit so people don't have to slobber it all over their faces.  I really hate a clunky salad.  The pear panini was satisfying and but the IKEA tables outside make me nostalgic for my own yard and my own cooking, thus reinforcing my tagline \"Vegetarian with a touch of snobbery\"I don't rate restaurants on their administrative prowess, but if I did I wouldn't give any to the TBC.  The waitstaff and management made it nearly impossible to process a reimbursement through the University of Illinois.  You would think, given their proximity to campus, that they would train people adequately with respect to how to handle the idiosyncrasies of receipt processing through the University.  Instead, I am wasting my work and personal time chasing down the original receipt for a charge entered incorrectly by a waitress.  And the day manager can't help me?  Um... I just recommend not going here at all if there is a chance you will need to then make your lifework sleuthing receipts.  Oh how fulfilling.   I've heard other people say that it is always a nightmare to expense TBC meals.   The U of I-area restaurants need to take a page from the book of vendors in other college towns and get their act together.",

The house-made mint iced tea and mulled wine were also very good.The food was interesting and delicious, and our waitress Joanna was awesome. She was friendly, answered all of our questions, and checked in just often enough to make sure we had what we needed without being overbearing.

My favorite is the cheese (gruyere) croissant because it is so flaky. It literally melts in my mouth. My coworker called it high class junk food but I call this good stuff. Sometimes, when I felt lazy to go to lunch, I would just buy a loaf of bread and eat that with a cup of coffee. The zufte or zoft, which is a Swiss specialty bread is amazing. It is fresh and out of the oven by 11am during school days. I have not seen other places in the area that sell zufte but the bread is really worth trying. Oh, if you have cravings for day old bread, they sell them at half price.They also have a wonderful selection for dinner. Daily specials change quite often but they have their regular dinner menu. I usually go with the daily special. This place also has fondue, both cheese and chocolate. I had both and I have to say that they are pretty stingy with their cheese and chocolate. I had barely enough to cover the fruit or bread. Do expect $12-$17 for entrees and about $10 for fondue. By the way, they sell cheeses too in the day.They have pretty good service but the people do not seem to smile a lot during the day, especially the owner. They should be happy because of the wonderful smell of fresh bread. The decor is a little European and has a fireplace at the corner which makes the place extra cozy in the evening. Anyhows, this place is highly recommended. I am sure you'll love it.",

A 45 minutes wait without as much as an apology. Then the \"masterpiece\" comes - frozen Walmart-quality mini-patty on a tasteless small bun. Everything way too salty. Barely edible. Ten bucks without tip for this sub-MacDonald concoction. Overworked, insufficient in numbers student workers who do little in terms of service but hope for a tip nevertheless. Obviously the owners worry more about as big a markup as possible than about their customers. The Bread Company does make big profit - the place caters to food-uneducated, wealthier young undergrads, who mistake this garbage for gourmet food, just because they have to pay four times what it's worth.

I lived in Germany for a while, so european style bakeries are even more happy.The first time I came to TBC, it was around 11am on a Tuesday and I wanted a quiet place to study. I wanted to get a small zupfe roll because they were fresh out of the oven and a cup of coffee, but that didn't cost $5 and I didn't have any cash (there is a $5 card minimum). I wound up getting an americano, a whole zupfe loaf, and a cookie. The zupfe was delicious. Hot from the oven, braided, yeasty, and slightly sweet. I pulled it apart and ate 1/3 of it right there. The cookie was pretty greasy. The americano was fine.The second time I came it was after a big exam and I wanted a glass of wine. At 11:30am. TBC was happy to oblige. My two friends ordered the portabella sandwich, which I had a bite of and I have to say it was delicious! Marinated chopped portabella mushrooms, melted cheese, some kind of sweet fruit spread. I wish I'd ordered it! I had a glass of riesling (which was fairly expensive for the quality) and a bowl of chicken noodle soup. I was hoping for a nice homemade soup with fat noodles and pieces of chicken, but what I got was a crock of bright yellow soup that I know came from a Mrs. Grass box. I will continue to come and try more of TBC's offerings, but definitely not the soups...",

The reviews on Yelp are quite mix and it appears that lunch is good, but dinner is so so. Since I have not found another restaurant that has chocolate fondue here in Central IL, we decided to come here for dinner. I will say that I really wanted to like this restaurant, but overall value is a 2 star, the option for fondue brings it up to a 2.5. It is located right on campus and I never even knew about this restaurant when I lived nearby. The ambiance is very eclectic, lots of wall decorations and a European cafe feel. The multiple non-matching chairs throughout the dining room maybe a \"modern\" design, but I felt it was very \"chintzy\". I thought about going with the filet or fish entree, but the other reviews made me a little concern so I went with a safe dish (Shrimp fettuccine) with a light tomato basil cream sauce. It took a bit of time for the dish to come out. Meanwhile, we were given complimentary french bread. Given the name of the restaurant I was a bit disappointed that the bread was not a soft piping hot bread from the oven. Well I digress, back to the entree, it really wasn't anything special. My wife's quote on her salmon salad and the pasta was, \"It taste like food you can make at home\". The portions sizes were also smaller than expected when you order pasta at a restaurant. I was hoping that the chocolate fondue would be the redeeming value of the meal. Unfortunately this was not the case. Typically you would expect strawberries and maybe even a rice crispy treat to dip in the chocolate. Don't get me wrong the dark chocolate was amazing, but they gave a plate of pears, green and red apples, and some sort of cake that crumbled when you poked at it too hard with the fondue fork. Service is hit or miss, our server came by a few times and made sure our cups of water were filled. This maybe a great place for date night on campus or maybe for sandwiches at lunch, but my dinner experience was so so.Pros: Cheese and chocolate fondue, I have yet to find another place that has this option. Great for date night with wine, cheese, bread etc. Cons: Expensive based on what you get, small portion size, no hot fresh bread from the bread company for dinner, where are the strawberries, marshmallow, or rice krispy treats with the chocolate fondue? I think if they tried they could make this a stellar restaurant here in CU.Hidden deals: Daily drink and food specials on the chalk boardHealth code rating: A. http://champaign.il.gegov.com/champaign/estab.cfm?facilityID=2000",

Cool -- except that the whole thing turned out to be kind of a disaster. We all ordered at the same time, and there seemed to be plenty of servers for a full room at dinner, but our meals arrived over the course of a half-hour (the pasta came after the steak, hmm). Fresh and tasty dinners, yes, but it was impossible to wait and eat together, and everyone was antsy due to the delays. In the end, we finished 20 minutes after our preferred time and our waitress did not seem particularly motivated to help the situation along or even really apologize.So: Good food, decent wine, but the service is a gamble. Try it, but go on a quiet weeknight -- definitely not for a Krannert opening or right before another occasion.",

Sandwiches are on luscious slices of thick bread and the soups come with crunchy salads. I especially like the grilled sandwiches, which are laced with creamy butter and lightly browned meat. Portions are quite large and one sandwich could probably be shared easily among two adults. Sometimes I forget this and end up making two meals out of one sandwich.During lunch hours this place is quite crowded, but by late afternoon it becomes serene. Soft green light floods in from the skylight and during the winter you can sit the fire with a baguette and a glass of wine.  As regards to the review that mentioned rudeness about adding protein to things, I've heard that happen many times during lunch and now they let you have your meat, but charge a lot for it. They have this bizarre policy because they \"don't want people making their own sandwiches with the bread that comes with the entree.\" Nice one. At night it becomes more formal, with candlelight, fondue, and more upscale entrees. The balsamic potatoes that come with the entrees are perfect. I like the fondue, but it's a little too much for me...even the small pot can be shared by two. Last time I was there I tried the tapas and the yellowfin tuna and the lamb were delicious, but I was less than enthusiastic about the duck mousse, which had a bland sickly sweet flavor. The greens that came with the tapas were also pretty inexcusable. When I go to a good restaurant I expect more than just some shredded romaine, especially when field greens are still in season. The new small desserts are also not so great. The chocolate mousse was good, but the bread pudding was just some bread soaked in eggs and sugar.",

Last time that I went I got the grilled turkey sandwich which comes with caramelized onions and cheese.Dinner options include fondue and pretty good pizza.  They also have some good bottles of wine on the list, I've ordered a bottle twice and been happy with what I got.  You might have to talk to one of the chefs if you want wine opinions since our server didn't seem to know much.Really good atmosphere and decor, it's casual/fancy enough for pretty much anything, and it's right next to Krannert if you need an after-show dinner.",

As a former music major, this was one of my usual haunts, but the rest of them hadn' t been there quite as frequently.  (Lunch, by the way, is excellent; they have excellent sandwiches and salads).The specialty, of course, is the fondue, which is magnifique.  My only gripe is that portion sizes tend to vary widely from time to time, as does the selection of vegetables that comes with your meal.  The combination of cheeses, though, is great, and the bread and potatoes are wonderful.Tonight, though, I had one of their specials, which was good, but was actually my *third* choice of menu items.  They were out of the fettucine with salmon AND out of the chicken pizza.  Now, I don't pretend to understand the inner workings of the restaurant business, but it really irritates me when they run out of something.  To me, that just smacks of poor planning.  Do they not have a kitchen?  Can they not make more?  If not, then can they not provide accurate estimates of how much of each food item to make, so they won't run out?  I don't know, but it just seems like when you go someplace, you should be able to look at the menu with confidence.Anyway, the beef fondue I had was very good, and one of my dinner companions adored her trout.  She said it was the most moist fish she had eaten in quite some time, and she is a fish lover.  Her husband, a reasonably picky eater, devoured his pancetta pizza with no complaints, as did another friend with his salmon.  I thought the portion sizes of some of the meals were pretty small, especially given the price.  Still, it's good food, and worth the money, especially when you consider it's not that expensive.  Service was pretty good, although a little slow, particularly since they weren't that busy tonight.  My guess is she just had a hard day.We love the Bread Company and will continue to visit, but probably just for the fondue.  We know they'll have it, and we know it's good.  Thanks for a fun evening!",

                "review": "Our family dined here after my sister's graduation. It was nice of them to move our reservation up on such short notice but after eating here, I understood why this wasn't a problem.If you're called \"The Bread Company\" you probably shouldn't serve burnt bread. The crust of our Italian bread was burnt. Though the bread was good otherwise, leaving a charred taste in your patrons' mouths is not the best way to start a meal.When my sister made the reservation they did not inform her that there wouldn't be a full menu that day. So though we looked at the menu online beforehand, we were only able to order from their limited graduation-day menu.There were seven of us and we ordered vegetarian dishes. Three of us had the grilled portobello sandwich with raspberry aioli and brie ($10), which was served with a side of salad greens and roasted potatoes. The presentation and portion-size were perfect. The mushrooms were fresh and juicy and the raspberry aioli went well with the brie. Those who ordered this plate seemed satsified.The other four of us split two pizzas: the roasted garlic with san marzano tomato sauce and Parmesan ($12), and the pesto with portabella, artichoke hearts and brie ($15). The reason we split them? Our waitress said they were 10 inch pizzas. They were actually smaller, about 6-7 inches in diameter. Now I usually love a cracker-thin crust, but ours was burnt in places. The roasted garlic pizza was at best a decent cheese pizza and the pesto with portabella and artichoke hearts did not benefit from the addition of brie; though it added texture, the brie did little to compliment the flavors of the other ingredients on the pizza. Overall the ingredients seemed fresh, but I've had much better thin crust pizza for less money, and more of it too. Though the restaurant seemed full, the same people were dining the whole time we were there. Only one party arrived while we were dining. It's a small place and there only seemed to be a server or two but seeing as it wasn't really busy, you'd think service would be more attentive. Our waitress was not. She was pleasant. She refilled our waters once and brought another basket of (still burnt) bread upon request. We were not asked if we wanted drinks or dessert. And we waited for our check for about twenty minutes. Turns out she went on lunch and took our check with her. We didn't gyp her on the tip at all--seeing as it's a college-town and they were probably short-staffed on graduation weekend, and we weren't running late for anything--but we certainly won't be dining here again. Side note: they do not accept Discover.Taking everything into consideration, I'd give this place a C+. I'm sure there are better white-cloth restaurants in Champaign-Urbana and you'd be better off eating there.",

I am less into fondue (exceot for chocolate dessert fondue), but this is the place to go for that.  The ambiance is eclectic and European.  Families will feel welcome.  Service can be a little ragged, sometimes a student group of 15 or large party will materialize, and that can have a rather deleterious effect on service when there are only 2 servers on the floor, which is often the case at night.  Even so, I have never had a meal here that was less than very good, and many that were excellent.",

The only reason I continue to go back has got to be because I forget about how sub-standard their food is. And today I decided to finally put my disappointment on the internet.This review was spurred by a visit today to get coffee and a pastry. I ordered an americano that was obviously made with poor quality espresso, and perhaps by someone with little knowledge of what an americano should be. It was too watery, but maybe that is my taste. I also had what they dared to call a chocolate croissant. It could have been made days ago. Instead of being light and fluffy, it was dense and doughy and filled with chocolate chips that were never fully melted so they maintained their chip structure. I was less than impressed. But this seems to be the way things go at the Bread Company.As I mentioned earlier, I have been going to the Bread Company for quite a few years (having been at the U of I as a student since 2008), and their menu has yet to change. At all. This sort of stagnancy is worrisome and really speaks to the lack of effort that the chef and/or owner put into this business.On a recent dinner visit I got the chocolate fondue which came with possibly pre-made cinnamon bread slices, strawberries, and a plethora of apples and pears. I suppose the apples and pears were in season (it was November when I went), but I don't see how apples work with chocolate. I've had their pizza many times, and I cannot deny that they do a good crust...but I just don't get the pizza that comes with a mountain of salad on top. It is just too much and overwhelms the pizza that really should be the star of the dish.Overall the Bread Company is uninspired and very tired. This is reflected in their dusty, unchanging interior, their menus, and the often impolite, lackluster performances of the staff.",

The only item on their menu that's worth mention is the grilled roast beef sandwich ($9.50 after tax) -- fried roast beef cold cuts, sauteed onions, and gruyere cheese. Just about anything else I've had there, including their soups, was just bland and cost waaaaay more than it should. Also, their pesto tastes nothing like basil, more like parsley puree - I definitely don't recommend getting anything that has it.

In case the staff reads yelp in between listening to the Smiths all day and wondering why they aren't famous artists yet, here are some tips:1.  Bring menus for everyone2.  Do not walk away if only three people have ordered and there are four people at the table.3. Do not roll your eyes, kid. 4. Do not pretend that you are a really good waitress who can remember everything.  You have to write it down because when you don't write it down you will end up bringing me the wrong thing.  5.  Do not forget to take empty plates off the rickety, unclean table because otherwise there is nowhere to put down the food. It's ok the first time you bring it because the order is wrong and you have to take it back.  (See number 3) 6.  Do not let our wine glasses get empty. We live in the midwest too.

                "review": "I've been to The Bread Company several times now; both with my visiting family for dinner and for sandwiches for lunch, and my experiences have been positive. First of all, the atmosphere is incredible. I've spent a lot of my life in Europe, and the way this place looks reminds me of little mom-and-pap restaurants one would find in the Mediterranean. This feeling is especially strong in the terrace in the back; stepping into that room feels like stepping into Spain. It's a bizarre, nostalgic experience for me, and one that hasn't happened quite as strongly anywhere else in the United States. The lunch is incredible. I like to think of myself as a bit of a sandwich connoisseur (hold your laughter), and the grilled sandwiches here are amazing. The dinner, unfortunately, isn't up to par with their lunch service. The only dish fresh enough in my memory to comment on is the shrimp linguine, which was a little bland. I haven't been able to try the fondue yet, which seems to be the go-to dish here, so I'll be trying that next time I go.Service is lovely, and their handmade drinks are very good too. Strongly recommended.",

I love coming here to relax and talk with my mom when we make lunch dates. I celebrated special occasions here as well growing up. They sure knew how to accommodate a large group of 14 year old girls on my birthday years ago!Recommendations-Roast beef sandwich-Portabella, brie, and raspberry jam sandwich-Zpfe bread, it's comparable to challah bread.-Cheese fondue - beautiful beautiful gruyere fondue. As good as Switzerland-Meat fondue - the broth is lovely, it's served with three different sauces and fresh baguette.-Chocolate fondue - Melted swiss chocolate, fresh fruit in season, cookies, pound cake.I love this place. It is one of my favorites.",

                "review": "When I went to school at U of I, I came here all the time during lunch to grab a roast beef or ham sandwich on their freshly baked swiss bread. Sometimes I went for the half soup/half sandwich, or half salad/half sandwich to get more variety in my diet. The food here is like comfort food for me, since I grew up in Urbana and my mother used to buy these sandwiches and their large loaves of freshly baked Zpfe for my brothers and me. The service at The Bread Company has always been fast and efficient, and the employees were always very cool and made no mistakes taking my order and making me a really good sandwich. I've been here a few times for dinner with my friends. The atmosphere totally changes in the evening for dinner, as they lay out white tablecloths, dim the lights and allow the romantic glow of candles set the mood. Their pizza is delicious and filling, and their tapas come in pretty big portions. This is a cute and cozy place for anyone on a date or double date, or out to celebrate a special occasion.I've ordered take out from them a few times when I've had last minute dinner party pot lucks to attend and didn't have time to cook. One time, I picked up a strawberry walnut mixed green salad, which was perfect, and also a french baguette with a side of baked garlic bulbs drizzled with olive oil. It was worth every dollar.I love this place!",

                "review": "One of my earliest experiences in Cham-bana, the very second night I spent with my boyfriend, now husband, he actually walked across the street from his dorm and brought me a ham and swiss on rye.  Now, I wasn't a huge fan of ham, and I truly hated swiss, and about all he knew was that I liked mustard (so he included it), but... being that we were so new together, I ate that sandwich like it was a long lost favorite.And shocking... instead of having to choke it down... I loved the thing!  Later in life, when I explained to him how much I hated ham and swiss sandwiches, I told him how amazed I was at how much I loved the one he'd been getting me from The Bread Company!!  Their ingredients, I mean!  Talk about fresh (I hate to sound like a commercial, but!  When it's true, it's true!!) The sprouts were genius, and the swiss was like none I'd ever had.  Ever!  Emmentaler. I mean, this place was no joke SMART about how it crafted food!  And there was no denying that rye!  The crown jewel of the whole thing!  Crunchy exterior, soft in all the right places, with a kick-yer-butt mustard... just out of this world spectacular.The whole thing became our ritual.  I'd come into town from Bloomy and we'd head over to Bread Company.  He'd get a loaf, hot out of the oven, of Challa, and I'd get my ham and cheese sandwich and we'd head back to his dorm.  Such bitter sweet memories.  And all over a sandwich!Trust me, this place makes some of the best fresh bread (I mean... HOT FROM THE OVEN GOOD), and some of the greatest food on campus.  They do more than sandwiches... OMG, go one night for the fondu!  It's an amazing experience!!  Whatever it is, find something you love and make it a memory to share.",

Speaking of the interior, no two chairs are the same, some are comfortable, others not so much, yet that's exactly what I like about this place...It's got character.

A pizza and appetizer is probably enough for two if you're wanting something light. The setting was nice and cafe-like, and the crowd small.

Then, my wife wanted tea..there was no sweet tea so she decided to have unsweet. Unfortunately BOTH of the unsweet teas were just about empty. She got half a cup and wasn't able to get more till we were leaving. The place was also filthy! There were a ton of open tables, but not one clean table and no one was cleaning tables. We picked the cleanest one and wiped it off ourselves. Also, the floor was littered with trash. On our way out my wife was refilling her tea, since she never got a full cup to start with, and a worker was straightening out the condiments, nodded to herself about a job well done and left. She also left another complete mess as there was sugar spilled all over the place. We will not be back.",

Before I put my review, let me say that I have had to contact corporate TWICE to try and see any type of resolve...Let's hope this second time will actually work... I have gone to the same Panera for the past three days and apparently they do not feel the need to pay attention to detail to those in the drive thru.  The first two days, I ordered exactly a large black iced tea with a cinnamon roll heated up.  The first day, they heated up and placed it inside the bag without a box, completely unsanitary.  The second day, they said \"we don't heat up cinnamon rolls here.\" I had to in fact inform the employee that they did heat cinnamon rolls, however, yet again, my cinnamon roll was thrown into a bag with my napkins and such thrown on top.  The third day took the cake.  I decided to spell it out for them because clearly they did not understand that a cinnamon, like any other pastry, goes in a box. So, I ordered a large black iced tea with a cinnamon roll heated up in a box.  And what did I get? A cinnamon roll, in a bag, not heated up.  The customer service here is beyond poor.  Upper management needs to step in because clearly the management at the store is not providing proper training.",

Oh, and get the unsweetened Acai Iced Tea! Maybe they have new management, maybe I was there on a good night, maybe I'm not that critical... I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about... service was friendly and professional... and no Panera is quick, duh, it's considered slow fast food just like 5-Guys and some other relatively new chains, you have to wait 5-10 minutes for your food because they make it to order. When you expect that and you see they are especially busy, I suppose 15 minutes could happen. I don't know. I had a good experience here and I enjoyed my meal. It sure beats MacDonalds...Cheers!",

I picked them off. The Chipolte mayo was a little spicy but added great flavor to the sandwich. It comes on Asiago cheese focaccia which I probably would have picked a different bread. I have tried other sandwiches and I have liked most of them.I tried one of the new pasta dishes the other day and was not overly impressed.  But I am not a pasta person.I went through the drive through for the first time today and I was really impressed with how quickly I got in and out of it.  It seems you wait longer for you food when you dine in.",

The person who waited on us was not friendly at all; a smile or a \"hi\" would have been nice.  The food wasn't up to par, either  There was one small dot of chipotle mayo on my Sierra turkey; guess they were rationing condiments that morning. The pricing structure on the You Pick Two has changed, now each thing is individually priced .  Our lunch was over $18; we drink water.....pretty pricey for a half sandwich with a salad or soup.  Bathroom needed some work as well.  Won't be back here.",

I've never been unhappy with Jimmy Johns, it's perfect for drunk food, sober food, all food. I even had it for breakfast once.Rather than having to fuck around with specifying EXACTLY what you want while they take ages moving the stupid sandwich down the line like at some OTHER sub shops, Jimmy Johns already knows what you want and they are not time wasters with your dinner. Plus it's not too expensive, and sometimes they accidentally give you free cheese. Turkey Tom all the way!",

Some of the pastries are better.  They sent out burnt french toast to me the other day (and not lightly: pretty black and charred). Manager did take one look when I walked it back to the counter and instantly ordered another one for me: so that was fast and helpful.  But, how how did it come out in the first place? staff cooked and hand delievered it: maybe without lookin at it? A brief apology would have made things nicer (a quick \"I'm sorry\" from that manager would have done, but not even that).Two different visits the coffee was mislabeled or served in the wrong container (e.g. flavored coffee in the \"dark roast\" bin). Letting them know was a shrug and an \"okay, I'll look at it when I finish sorting these boxes\")Staff is friendly but often are giggling at inside jokes or talking with each other while taking your order.Summary: not horrible, but low attention to detail and customer service and mediocre food means Panera is probably a better choice.",

I guess the comparison can't be helped as they're both soup and sandwich chains, but my answer: absolutely not.  I harbor a special love for Panera in my heart that Atlanta will never compete with, no matter how many tries I give it.  My visit today pretty much confirmed that.A fist-sized portion of bread is served with most meals.  In the past, I've always been turned off by their bread, which is usually pale and under-baked.  I don't have much faith in a place that claims to be a \"bread company,\" but serves such sorry bread.  On my most recent visit, the baguette wasn't disturbingly discolored and it had a nice crunch to the crust.  I also noticed a subtle hint of olive oil in the bread's recipe.  Maybe they're making a few improvements.Like most lunch chains, I'm sure the soup comes packaged and is heated in-store.  I ordered the chicken and wild rice soup today.  Highlights: the soup had conspicuous specks of pepper and bright green chives.  Unfortunately, it also had the color and consistency of glue...  I suspect that the grain had broken down and congealed into a thick paste that was not appetizing.Atlanta also separates itself from Panera by serving a few additional items on their menu, including pastas.  My vegan lunch buddy tells me that Atlanta is a little more generous to those with dietary restrictions, though I don't have any special recommendations to vegetarians/vegans out there.",

The wheat bread was huge - think texas toast size - which made it very difficult to eat two slices as a sandwich. I eventually threw the bread aside and just ate the chicken salad out of it with a fork.The half salad was bad. No, really bad. The lettuce was not fresh and I had a lot of pieces of lettuce that had the hard white vein running through the middle of the leaf. Ick. They don't have french dressing so I went with the honey mustard which was another bad choice. I took two bites and threw it away - there went $3!For the amount of money I spent (total was almost $10!) and for the amount of food and the quality I received - the next time I'm going elsewhere.",

A pretty good place for lunch and studying, though.  It's never gotten too loud during lunchtime or right after lunch, but sometimes they shut off the free wifi from 11:30am-1:30pm to deter people with laptops from hanging around during that time.  Large booths and tables tend to be a pretty good size, big enough for a couple people to study at.   Unfortunately, they close pretty early during the week and on the weekends, forcing people to pack up and go somewhere else.  Overall, not bad for food and studying, but not great for those who are looking for somewhere to study at night.",

She seems distracted the whole time, so I'm pretty sure she just wasn't paying attention. The cashiers were rather chatty, which is totally fine, except they were ignoring waiting customers just so they could finish their conversation. Very unprofessional, not to mention annoying.As for the food...meh. I ordered the veggie panini and was not impressed. The bread was soggy and all sorts of mashed, and the filling was pretty flavorless (haven't they heard of herbs?). It came with a pickle and chips, which you can't really mess up. All in all, I was not happy with this place, and I won't be eating there again.Honestly, just go to Panera. The food is better and the service is usually on point.",

What I like about Atlanta is the breakfast menu.  There are several omelets and all are decent, though not exceptional.  The accompanying potatoes are so-so and usually cold.  Toast is always soggy.  The breakfast sandwiches are decent.  I have breakfast there every day during the week as it is near my workplace.  I have something different each day and the price is reasonable and the food is tolerable.  Under $5 for a three eggs omelet, potatoes, and toast isn't too bad.  I've tried all the omelets and two of the breakfast sandwiches and while they won't win any culinary rewards, they are filling and somewhat tasty.  Somewhat.  Do I recommend this place?  Well, like many such places, it's hit and miss.  Don't go with high expectations and you will be okay.

My daughter and I were in a hurry and we stopped in at 10:00 AM on  Thursday, January 15, 2015. We ordered  two bagels, toasted, with cream cheese. We learned that the service that is connected with this involves tossing a portion control packet of cream cheese into a paper bag and throwing in a plastic knife. We asked for them to toast the bagels and spread the cheese on them.  For this we got snarls.There were five employees standing around chatting among themselves but the person wearing the manager badge was doing food preparation on the customer service of some large bowl of chopped bread. When she coughed right over the bowl of chopped bread it was not a good sign.11 minutes later there was no sign of our bagels. Nor was there any sign of activity from the five idle workers. So I inquired. One of them told me that the \"cheap bastard\" that owns the place has refused to fix the toaster on the front service line so our food has to be prepared back in the kitchen the manager then said they're working on it.15 minutes after we walked in the door on a business day with no customers ahead of us we left with two toasted bagels and the manager promised me it wouldn't be this bad the next time we came. I promised her there wouldn't be a next time.",

For just a little over 20 dollars we received an Avocado sandwich, Turkey Bacon Rustica sandwich, and a strawberry smoothie. Well.... The avocado was quartered and put on the sandwich which made the greenish brown bits slippery thus, fall out frequently onto your plate instead of in your mouth. To top this the avocado had the stem attached. What could make this any better? Perhaps the bread wasn't quite leavened to the point of a bakery shop's presumed reason to exist. I'm not sure why we actually ate this (We were quite hungry). The Turkey Rustica wasn't that much better. For having the word bacon in it, I do not remember actually being able to taste any sort of bacon within its contents. The bread also seemed to be a bit stale, but it was at least cooked correctly. To be fair some of the more finer points is that this place made a good tasting smoothie (although, one can argue how hard that is). Being from the west coast, perhaps I am just a snood to what a good upscale bakery/sandwich/cafe shop should be. This is not that kind of example.",

However, Atlanta is a little closer to the main drags, and the local Paneras (esp. the Old Farm one) have such throngs of retirees, locals, students, meetings, etc. that it can be a zoo at certain times.",

The dishes I had did consist of fresh ingredients, but I think they were more healthfully prepared which made them not quite that super sodium-y fatty Panera tasty.  It was really clean in there, but I kind of got the feeling that was only because it was brand new and that in 6 months it would be grimy.  The staff were really friendly, but it was a very forced friendliness.The free wifi is cool.  If it were closer to campus, I would probably think it was a great place to have a working lunch or a sticky bun while doing more work after work.",

While I was waiting on line I Wikipediaed them turns out it's a knock off. Basically in 1993 the creator of AB visited a PB and figured that if he stole basically everything down to the warm earthy decor of PB he would have a successful place. At its peak there was 250 franchised locations across the US in 2014 there are about 50 still standing. So I'm assuming that this Atlanta bread here in champaign has been a successful franchise because it's one of the few survivors. I had a cheddar broccoli soup and a Caesar salad. Soup was solid, salad was decent. The portion sizes on both were generous. I liked that after you order they bring the food out to you. I didn't like that they blatantly ripped off Panera bread. I did notice they have pizza on the menu so I guess that's their highlighted difference between Panera bread. So yeah if you like soup salad bread or Panera you will probably like this place.",

But I didn't know what sandwich to pick so I asked which ones were ordered more often.  I chose the grilled chicken pesto pannini and it wasn't very good.  I can't imagine anyone ordering this pannini for a second time.  The chicken tasted old and the pesto had no flavor.  It even looked unappealing too.

In my opinion, the amount of food received for the price is very low.I just went today to get some soup, and ended up with a 10oz. bowl of Chunky Baked Potato soup and what I would describe as a 'morsel' of bread for about $4.  The bread was about half of the baguette size at Panera (which seems to be the obvious comparison, and similarly overpriced), and I felt that the soup quality (approximately cream of potato) and portion size were low on both counts.I have been here at least 3 times, that I can remember, and have had similar feelings each time. My previous visits were for sandwich/soup combos that were definitely not worth remembering.  The building and location are both nice, and convenient to my work, but I can't say for certain that I'll return soon.",

                "review": "This Subway is absolutely terrible.  I like subway and it's food in general, but this branch is completely ruined by absolutely terrible service and quite possibly the worst employees I've ever seen at a food establishment.Now, I've been here about 20-25 times since it's only a block away from my work (and it's one of the healthiest things to grab nearby), and the same damn issues are present every single time.  I've now stopped going completely since I can't stand this branch.First off, they are always out of ingredients or bread.  I usually get the chicken breast foot long sub.  There had to be at least 10 occasions I went and they had no chicken breasts.  It's also not uncommon for them to be out of bread, and common ones too.  No wheat, no Italian?  There's been a few instances where all they had left was something obscure like Monterery Cheddar, and this isn't some off hour.  Its usually right during lunch!   I can understand once or twice, but you think they would take action to stop this from happening since it seems to happen ALL THE TIME?  Anybody ever think to make more bread???They have been out of tomatoes, out of peppers, onions out of cucumbers... It's ridiculous.  The worst part is they act rude instead of apologetic.  \"WE DONT HAVE THAT...\"  ok.... no need to yell at me there.... Honestly though, the worst part are the employees.  It's been the same 4 people every time I go.  The least worse of the bunch is the manager.  She is an older lady, and while generally nice, there have been days where she has been outwardly disgruntled, and talked to customers rudely, looking as she was almost ready to snap, but usually she is able to keep it shelled in... The other employees, *sigh...There's two younger girls who work there.  They have never been rude, but they work extremely lethargically.  They often keep asking what you want, and take a long time to put your sub together.  They really need to pep up, because they just act like it's killing them to be there...  Maybe it is killing them, but you work a customer service job, you got to perk up!The last employee that works there is a young male and he appalls me every single time with his actions.  I really have no idea how he still has a job.  His behavior is ridiculous. He is probably, and consistently, the most disgruntled employee in the entire world... He throws sandwiches together like they were no better than mush.  He doesn't change his gloves often so I have had far too many sandwiches with buffalo chicken sauce, oriental sauce, etc etc on my sandwich.... Yea, big no no.  Thank god I don't have allergies, but hot buffalo chicken sauce definitely does not taste any what appetizing smeared all over my cold cut either...It  doesn't stop there.  He rants about his job to every single customer.  No one even asks him, yet he is constantly letting you know how badly his job sucks and how he can't handle it.  It's like sheesh man, we all worked crappy jobs at some point, but that attitude sure isn't going to get you anywhere....  It's not even something like a dreary \"Man, I'm having a rough day...\"  It's more like a resentful \"God! why do so many damn people have to come in, I can't believe this shit... AGHH KILLLLL MEEEE PLEASE.\"No lie people.... that is what he does, and that is why I get so bothered by it.  In some ways, he acts like so much of a trainwreck it's almost amusing to watch his anger grow.  I've had my fair share of watching him throw stuff, bang his head off a wall, and even once scream \"F*** my life!!!!\" during the middle of making a sub after he dropped the bun on the floor.  Still, for as funny as it could be, it's just plain rude.  He has made fun of customers several times, and his constant whining gets on one's nerves way too easily.  He acts like he is the only one with problems in his life...All and all, I love the Subway chain in general, but this branch has serious issues.  The service is terrible, and the staff is rude and downright horrendous with the way they act.  I still love Subway, but I will never go to this branch again.",

I keep forgetting that subway American cheese is white, I should have just gotten their cheddar.The toasting was poorly done and the customer service was pretty bad. Needless to say I'm not impressed, in fact -to help potential patrons: I'd like to let you all know that the juices in store cost $1.49-$3.15 but you can get more variety juices from the vending machines for $1.25.",

I'm usually sympathetic to unmotivated or cranky employees (after all, there's nothing glamorous about working at a fast food place).  Unfortunately, the college kids who work here are particularly resentful--and they don't mind taking it out on your sandwich.I came in by myself to pick up dinner for friends.  When I tried to place my order, the girl working the register (who was obviously new) struggled to punch in each item.  No one seemed interested in helping her, even though 4 other people stood behind the counter.  She finally started yelling at them...still, they just stared blankly at the cold cuts in front of them (maybe they were stoned?).  After they made and wrapped my subs, they placed them on the counter in front of me.  I asked if they could bag them since it would be awkward to carry all those sandwiches on my own.  One employee pointed to a stack of paper bags and told me I could bag them myself, if I wanted.The sandwiches are all just variations on a theme: meat of choice, watery mayo, tomatoes, a modest smear of avocado, and too much shredded iceberg lettuce.  The taste is much improved if you add their tasty hot peppers, but I very rarely crave a Jimmy John's sandwich.For fast food sandwiches, I vote Subway.  The only benefit of Jimmy John's is that they deliver.",

I turned my phone on a few minutes before the time it was supposed to be ready by. The guy called right at 11, the desired time. He seemed disinterested on the phone and mumbled. I went down to meet him and he was just kind of standing there looking distracted. I walked up and he handed me the bag with barely a word. I signed and confirmed his tip. He took the ticket back from me, mumbled a word or two, turned around and trudged down the stairs. He let out this long, depressed/annoyed sigh as he exited. No 'thank you' or 'have a good day.' I had no missed calls but there's a chance he had been trying to call me when my phone was off and was pissed cuz he had other orders, but the delivery was for 11 and his call was right on time. You'd swear he'd just gotten dumped. I'd had him before without much issue. I know fast food work sucks, but.... dude.... The drivers are usually great to passable. This was very out of character for either campus location.I opened the bag and they had not included the expensive-ass chips I ordered. This is when I knew there was gonna be a phone call. I called to complain and they took the chips off the bill. I hope it went without saying to remove the tip. The girl was helpful considering they were probably busy. I got the right sandwich, but it didn't taste nearly as good as usual. In hindsight, the lettuce may have been discolored in a not-so-fresh kinda way. I now have a stomach ache and it was almost definitely the sandwich. I still plan to order from there often, but this was crazy. The only reason this is 2 stars and not 1 is because this is out of character. I've never once called a restaurant to complain before this, so you know it was bad. I take my Jimmy John's very seriously.Some napkins would be a nice regular addition too.",

They always greet you when you come in, and say goodbye when you leave, and I have yet to have an interaction that's not pleasant.Also, they really are freaky fast!! One time I ordered to deliver at the Art+Design building, and they were there *less than 6 minutes later*. How is that even possible??",

One bite of my friend's sandwich and  it was apparent this establishment is run by someone who has no regard whatsoever for quality (gourmet! hahaha!!!) nor his customer's health. Jimmy John, you are a money grubbing pig of a man. You should be ashamed of yourself, and if you believe in hell, I hope you then believe that's where you'll end up for trading such bottom of the barrel filth, for people's, often times, hard earned money.Don't go here if you have tastebuds or any regard for your body at all",

I probably come here once a week, more or less, and haven't had any bad experiences. Still a cornerstone of the student diet, and great for a quick meal. Is it a little bit overpriced for cold cuts, veggies, and bread? Probably. But when you're in between classes or rushing to catch a bus somewhere, it matters, and besides, you probably won't find much better for a $6 meal anyways. The bread tastes great, the lettuce is always crisp, and the balance between the meat, toppings, and mayonnaise is always spot-on.",

I like simple sandwiches and Jimmy John does some great, cheap, simple sandwiches.  Their 'slims' (no veggies or sauce) on the menu are only $3.25, plus I can pick up a ~14\" piece of day old bread for like $0.50, and I've got myself a full meal for like $4; I can't complain about that!The staff have always been really friendly.  I think they're forced to sort of yell \"Hello\" and \"Catch you later\" as you enter and leave the shop.  But they sound sincere enough, so I'll say that's a good thing for them to do.  But, no complaints here. However I can't really complain about nothing and give it 4 stars, so:  Analyzing their pricing a little more carefully I discovered that for $0.75 more you can go over to subway when they're doing the $5 footlongs and get like 3-4 more inches of sandwich for 75 cents more.  I did some calculating:  You'd save 12 cents an inch of sandwich by doing this!  Over your college career that'd be approximately $240 (assuming an average consumption of 2 sandwiches/week for 4 school years).  Just some food for thought.  Luckily Jimmy John's gives me a $1 off for not getting veggies (which brings me to about 1 cent/inch cheaper than subway), so I don't have to make that decision.",

There's just something divine about the combination of good bread, quality meat, fresh toppings, and well-chosen condiments all put together in a user-friendly package. Regrettably, Jimmy John doesn't provide that.Start with the bread-- plain white bread with zero flavor and no character. No whole wheat option (for at least a dollar more, you can get seven grain bread for some, not all, of the sandwiches), no flatbread or wraps. This is allegedly gourmet?! Then there's the filling. Somewhere buried under the bland bread, mound of industrially shredded lettuce, and pale cardboard-tasteless tomato there's a slice or two of meat that is hard to notice. Condiment choice is narrow, and the application thereof is extremely variably, sometimes drowned in it and sometimes featuring the merest swipe. Hot sandwich choices simply don't exist. You crave a hot roast beef or hot ham with melted gruyere? Too bad. These sandwiches are a step below even national chains like Subway, where they at least provide more choices and flavor profiles, from fillings to condiments to toppings, and yes, hot sandwiches!I suppose I understand why inexperienced, budget-conscious people would give them a lot of business-- the basic sandwiches are cheap and filling (all that bread and lettuce!), adequate enough for quick thoughtless sustenance. But for a place that labels itself \"gourmet\" it falls so far short it's laughable.I grudgingly give Jimmy John's two stars because it's possible to get a decent sandwich from them, by getting something from the \"deluxe\" side of the menu made with whole-grain bread, or adding extra meat, cheese, and toppings to the basic sandwich choices-- both options that will bring the cost beyond the tolerance of the targeted audience (and still not in the \"gourmet\" category).A word about the delivery: They advertise \"freaky fast\" delivery, which is probably why I see their delivery drivers committing every moving violation you can imagine. Wrong way on a one-way street? No problem. Right on red in a campus district where it's clearly prohibited? You bet! Ignoring pedestrians in crosswalks? Why not?",

The ladies working there are super friendly and nice to every single person that walks in, and they always make my day. The food is good too, standard cafeteria fare as well as some unique options. They always have one or two vegetarian entrees in addition to the salad bar, so that's a plus for those who don't eat meat. The only drawback is they don't accept credit cards, just cash or check.",

Its not a hard choice between Perkins, Don Juan, Hot Wok, Taco Bell or the Beckman Cafe.There are days where food here is 4 star worthy and there are days where the food quality just lets you down. So it's pretty hit or miss. The nice thing about their online menu is that you can plan things out ahead of time. The cooks/servers can also have their off days for sure. Sometimes they're so friendly, it freaks me out. They can also get so picky about things that don't matter and give you quite the attitude. I suppose I might feel similarly if I was a career line cook.",

Sometimes I want Midwestern cafeteria comfort food. If I do, it is OK to come here. But if I'm honest I can't tell you that \"this is a good restaurant.\" (Hence the two-star rating.)Five funny things about it:1. It's male. It is always full of scientists and engineers from the Beckman and CSL. Perhaps for that reason it is one of the few establishments that I have entered on a busy day and noticed that of the 20 patrons there are zero women.2. It's university-run. Since it is run by the university, a sign says that you can pay by university purchase order if you want to.  I have never seen anyone do this.3. The secret garden. You can eat in a garden that almost no one uses or knows about -- to find it you must leave via the West door. It is dedicated to women in science.4. The regulars. Some people show up at the counter and are served without ordering. I asked a staff member about this and she said, \"He's been wanting the mac and cheese for thirteen years.\"5. The almost-free salad. I stuff as much into the container as I can and yet after it is weighed I am charged something like 82 cents. (Dressing extra.) Although it is a very plain salad bar.Most of the food is actually prepared at a food service warehouse somewhere else. I asked when I saw \"tortilla crusted tilapia with long grain wild rice and Kyoto mixed vegetables\" and the \"lemon mist cake.\" Once you see the place, you'll have a hard time imagining them preparing the tilapia and baking the cake from scratch in the back room, and it turns out they don't.  (But both dishes are OK.) Some of the offerings don't bother. Cream-based soups are a disgusting glop.Some of the naming conventions on the menu make me smile. \"with white sauce.\" (?)  \"Ground beef steak\" = a hamburger patty.Some things... Heck yeah. Jambalaya is good. The pot roast is good. The hamburger (\"ground beef steak\") is good. I agree with Sarah H. -- the pecan-cranberry chicken salad is the big winner. Delicious. And the staff are delightful.  They'll loan you money. They'll change the dishes around for you.  They'll sneak you extra food and not charge you for it if you are even a little nice to them.You can check the menu online before you go: http://www.beckman.illinois.edu/cafe/Note that they run out of their main dishes almost every day, usually after about 90 minutes.In sum. It's a strange little cafeteria. But it may be worth visiting at least once just to hang around a weird cafeteria full of weird scientists.",

So when I was craving some sandwich goodness I decided to try it out.If Subway is 2 stars, Jimmy Johns is 3 stars.  Definitely a step-up from Subway, but nothing super spectacular.I got the Vegetarian sub, easy on the mayo.  It was simple, and tasty.  The bread tasted good but was really chewy.  After finishing my sandwich I felt like my jaw got a pretty good work-out.  I was also disappointed by the amount of avocado spread, or lack there-of.  There was just enough to add flavor, but it didn't make up a very substantial part of the sub.  Cucumbers were crispy, tomatoes tasted fresh, and the sprouts were good.  For such a simple sandwich, it would have been nice to have something other than iceberg lettuce...kind of just seemed like filler more than anything else.Overall, it was good.  Service (at the drive-thru) was really fast.  I'll definitely choose Jimmy Johns over Subway in the future when I'm in need of a \"fast-food\" sandwich, but I'm not sure I'll go out of my way to come here.",

Distance limits?  Do you have to live next door to the place to get delivery?  I'm only 2.1 miles.  It takes less than five minutes to get to my house from that location.  So why don't I just go there and get it myself?  Because, Jimmy Johns brags about their \"freaky fast\" delivery, so why not take advantage of that?  But I'm too far.  Get real.",

First off, the music was so loud that I'm not sure what we would have done if they didn't offer outdoor seating. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy listening to music while I eat but this wasn't listening it was enduring. Where do I even begin? I ordered a slim turkey for our two small kids. I thought that they came with cheese and turkey but they said that is not true and would only put meat on the sandwich and when I asked to put some mayonnaise they said that that could not be done but they would give me a packet of mayonnaise to add myself-what?! We did not get any napkins with our sandwiches, when I went to the counter to ask for some I was flippantly told that they were at the end of the sandwich making counter. There were no napkins out, no lids, no straws... So bizarre! An employee was sitting at the booth closest to the ordering counter. After eating his meal he was smoking a vaporizer for a good 10 minutes or so -could be longer since we left and he was still there. There are more details I could add but I will stop. Overall the weirdest experience at a Jimmy John's we have ever had. Honestly, it was like the staff were high but not in a good way. :/",

My complaint is the constant implication that they are all about healthy eating when they offer a single item on the menu that is vegan and it is only sporadically on the menu. The Black Bean soup is supposed to be vegan and is the only thing - other than a small side salad or an apple - that is a vegan meal. My issue other than the fact that there is no selection is that the Black Bean Soup is only on the menu certain days and not always reliably. Thus, it isn't worth going in to even try the place.  I raised the issue with an employee and she said they are \"working on it.\" That is pretty far behind the times and how hard is it to put a few more vegan items or to offer the one you have consistently? This is not generally and overall a healthy place to eat and really tries to make it look like it is. I hope someday they catch up and offer some vegan choices and more vegetarian fare also.",

I also like their granola parfaits. You really can't go wrong with any of the options there. The service is fast and friendly too. Great place for a U of I student to grab a bite and study at the same time. I had an oatmeal raisin cookie there once and it was perfectly chewy (got it for free). I also like that the MyPanera rewards card gets you rewards like free drinks, pastries, soups, etc. The only thing I don't like about Panera is the calorie count of their foods, but it's nice to splurge every once in a while. I'm so grateful they post their nutrition information online, and in the store.",

On campus, students take up space doing homework while diners walk around looking for seats.  The food is good.  The sandwichs are interesting and tasty.  The soups are mostly good, especially in a bread bowl.  Salads are also tasty and you can mix and match the sandwich, soup, and salads.  The Mediterranean Veggie is a fav, but the consistency of its assembly leaves much to be desired.  Sometimes it's sloppily slapped together and may be missing an ingredient or have a small amount of it.  The Baked Potato soup is quite good.  The seasonal Wild Mushroom soup is awesome.  They've had some other great soups on occasion, like Fire Roasted Corn.  The bagel selection is good but they're really nothing like New York bagels.  More bread than bagel.  The breads are excellent and the bakery items decadent.  Great Bear Claws and Danish and the Cobblestones are pretty good, though sometimes dry.  The Cinnamon Rolls are good in the centers but the outer edges are usally dry.",

When I brought it to their attention that they forgot the dressing they insisted that they did, but gave me salad dressing still. The most irritating part was that after we started to eat, they decided to clean around our table. They were cleaning the AC vent and the hanging light fixtures that were hanging above and around the table. A little consideration would be nice! Having dirt fall on you from above, and around you, is not a pleasant way to eat your food.",

They also overcharge for the soup considering the fact that is has been frozen in a bag for a few days and then warmed up in warm water. They do have the loyalty card which does come in handy but you have to be a regular customer to actually receive good rewards.",

They are a great place to grab breakfast, lunch, and dessert. Their hot sandwiches are delicious and I always get the chips with one, even though you also have the choice of a baguette or apple. I took the unhealthy route with chips, but they're pretty good.Their bagels are a staple there. My favorite is the French Toast and the honey walnut cream cheese is to die for.Their breakfast sandwich, the Power Breakfast Sandwich, or whatever it's called, is really good and you should try it was sausage instead of ham and add some jelly.The pastries are also really good. The mini Pineapple Upside Down cake is delicious and not too sweet. Their brownies are some of the best I've had from a to-go food place. The chocolate chip cookies (get them in the bag) are so good, I'm curious how they get them to be that good.I'm a die hard Panera fan and I recommend you go because there are options for everyone.",

I love dipping their sourdough baguette into the warm soup.It's definitely a good place to stop by for lunch as they're quick, and you can always grab it to go.  Always a safe bet.  Plus!

The toppings include: mayo, honey mustard, hot peppers, lettuce, onion, tomato, pickle, oil, and Italian seasoning. I wish it said how big these subs are... I'm thinking they're either 7\" or 8.\" There's originals, bigs (30% more meat), and skinnys (thin cut breads) type of subs. I got an original A Wreck (salami, roast beef, turkey, ham, and swiss cheese) on multigrain bread. It cost $5 and it was pretty good! I also think it's interesting that they have some random guy playing a guitar and singing as their background music.",

The sandwiches come on delicious bread and are toasted: just great! They also have salads and soups, and a good selection of fountain drinks... (IBC root beer, yay!).

And I'm definitely a fan of the customer service and atmosphere.It's nice that they prepare the sandwiches and cut the meats fresh in front of you.The first two times I went I was not impressed by the food.. I had the cheesesteak and also a wrap. Both of which are nothing extraordinary. Actually, the wrap was pretty pathetic portion-wise for how much they charged for it.My recent experiences have been nothing but stellar. I have got the NUMBER 9 every time. Roast beef, turkey, bacon, chesse, and Mike's way always makes it an amazing meal. The staff are super customer service oriented too. They were making the wrong order for me and just combined the two sandwiches like I asked - which resulted in a Mike's Gargantuan more or less. Another time, it was near closing and they forgot to put bacon on my #9 and my friend's. So, I told them and they literally gave me with a pound of bacon for my trouble.All in all, my experiences with Jersey Mike's makes it a wonderful option for sandwiches.",

I got the Super Sub (provolone, ham, prosciuttini and cappacuolo) on white and a small drink. It was just under $9. My first thought was this looks like a glorified Blimpie. They slice the rectangular loaves of meat to order and make the sandwich in front of you. The topping selection is okay. They had jalapenos so I was set. Upon trying my super sub, I was not impressed. Actually, my sandwich tasted just like a Blimpie Best. Half of it went into the garbage and I sincerely regretting not ordering the mini sub size. This place is not quite comparable to Subway, maybe a step above? The fountain Pepsi burned my throat and was AWESOME. Highlight of my meal. Based on my sub-par sandwich experience, I don't plan on coming back.",

I've been here at least 3 times so far. I've tried the turkey & provolone and the Italian sandwich (only cold sandwiches). This is like a lower quality version of Subway to me and the sandwiches are pricer. A regular 6 inch is almost $6 compared to Subway at about $4+ The bread can be kind of dry. I suggest getting it \"Mike's way\" which is the addition of vinegar, oil, and some spices. Despite the sandwiches being a little sub par and not having much to offer they are still very fulfilling. For a female I definitely would recommend getting the regular. Something about this place, I'll be back.",

When I first ordered here, I didn't know anything about their food, so I ordered a #13, original Italian, because that's my benchmark of a sub shop. My favorite sub in Chicago is Fontano's, a little grocery place near UIC campus. The JM sub ties Fontano's for excellence in a sandwich. Subway, Jimmy John's and Quizno's shouldn't even be mentioned in the same breath with JM's. The only problem is that the Champaign store is on campus, and right now there are very few places to park. But it's well worth walking a few blocks.",

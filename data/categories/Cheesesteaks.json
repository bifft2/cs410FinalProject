I came in here on a moderately busy Sunday night and ordered a, 8\" parmesean chicken sandwich, expecting it to be any regular sandwich that I buy a campustown eatery, but, my goodness, this was probably the most awful sub I have ever eaten. After mind-numbingly slow service (from payment to sandwich was 15 minutes), a visually appetizing sub came out, with chicken, mushrooms, onions, topped with a layer of melted cheese. As I grab the sandwich, the middle just starts dripping everywhere, and by the third bite, the bottom just falls apart. The rest of the meal was just a struggle to get the greasy concoction back between the slices of bread. I guess the food tasted alright, but it just takes away from the experience when you have a mess of food dribbling all over your hands. I come here to get a sandwich for a reason because it's easy and quick to eat. The fries, too, were just terrible. I don't think I even tasted any potato inside of the fried exterior. They were hard, bland, and unappealing! Perhaps this was just an off-day for them. I've had better at other Penn Station locations.",

So of course they started to prepare them as a for here order.  Watching the girl prep our food we were concerned that she wasn't wearing any gloves while preparing the food.  My order of fries was only 3/4 of the way full.  When it's $5 for an order of fries I prefer to get my money's worth.  Food was good although 3 of our party didn't get what they ordered.",

I thought this might have been a mistake the first time, the second time I spoke to the manager and they said the recipe had been changed but I could ask to have it made the old way.  The third time I asked for it to be made the old way and I asked this of an employee that I recognized as having worked there long enough to know.  Again, it was completely bland and tasteless, the new way.  I wrote to the management and explained to them that I didn't like this new recipe and even when asked to make it the old way, I received it the new way.  I told them that I wanted to see some kind of concession made so that I could enjoy the sandwich the way I knew it (which really was a simple change, but probably meant a bit more expense per sandwich, adding up to a lot if done with everyone).  They didn't reply to me, no one offered a discount for another sandwich because I had spent full price three times on what I believed was a sub-standard sandwich.  So, I'm not going back.",

I'm always skeptical when places like this advertise \"East Coast\" anything, be it subs, pizza, whatever, as I am Brooklyn born and raised.  Their resemblence to any East Coast fare is usually pure hype.  I ordered the Italian sausage with onions and peppers and a small fries.  The sub was quite good.  Very tasty.  The fries were fresh and above fast food standards.  Offering little packets of malt vinegar for the fries was a nice touch.  Service was relatively quick and friendly.  I give it three stars rather than four because four stars says that I'm a fan.  Much as I enjoyed my first experience there, I'm not a fan, just a satisfied customer.  East Coast?  Well, the sub I had, though good,  was certainly not up to the standards of a Sausage HERO in Little Italy.",

At first, I was a bit suspect based on what others have told me and having eaten at places in chicago, but I was pleasantly surprised! They have a large variety of sushi from spider rolls to something called a spicy tuna pizza, which is a rice patty tempura with spice tuna and spicy mayo on top. They should really add to the appetizer portion of the all-u-can-eat menu though. The only thing that really irks me about this place is that they raised the prices by like $8 within a year! WHO DOES THAT!??! Thank the lord my friends have coupons so we were able to still get the deal for a decent price. Overall, the all-u-can-eat deal is good, but only if you have those coups, lol.",

I had the shrimp tempura roll and an eel roll, so I can't really comment on the quality of the fish, but what I had seemed to be of decent quality.  Oddly the sushi combo came with an egg roll which decent as well.  If I feel like eating some sushi this place would suffice without breaking the bank.",

The only reason I gave this place a shot after experiencing their sloppy food is because it's so close to engineering campus.A word of caution for those who care:None of the non-sushi items are vegetarian it turns out. Before I order something, I usually make a point to double-check. When I asked about the 'vegetable teriyaki', the guy rudely said 'that's why it says vegetable'.When I received my plate after his reassurance, I noticed some meat in the dish. I took the thing back to him, and he refused to talk to me because he said 'I wasn't a customer'! What?! I lost it when he told me to get out of the line.Bottom line is that place has bad service, is extremely inhospitable, and is not suitable for vegetarians. Furthermore, after the owner had to get involved, I learned that the all sauces/broths have some chicken in them. I can understand when someone makes a mistake. I hate when people who cannot admit it when it happens and make no attempt to rectify the situation afterwards.",

The menu is huge, definitely biased toward sushi and sushi rolls, but contains other things like rice porridge, teriyaki, or noodle soup. I had a sushi roll, which was, expectedly, pricey and did not fill me up, but the following time I enjoyed a very agreeable bowl of vegetable congee. I'm usually wary of places that try to cook such a huge menu of foods, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that they are doing a pretty ok job of it.  Definitely stop by, at least once, it's worth a look.",

I always get one of the 2 or 3 roll sushi specials that come with an egg roll which are $7 for 2 rolls or $9 for 3 rolls for lunch and then $1 more at dinner time. They have the popular sushi rolls you would get in your average Japanese restaurant but a few special rolls as well. It has a sort of fast food feel to it because you order at the counter but the taste is better than any of the other sit down sushi restaurants on campus.I get the take out quite often and they are VERY quick and always do a good job of packing enough condiments. I will definitely be eating here several times a week during the school semester - it has become one of my favorite campus restaurants since it's opening.",

Nor is it a sushi restaurant with great variety of rolls. The quality is decent enough, the rolls large, and the meal filling. We ordered 6 different types of rolls (a lot of food -- we were not able to finish), all roughly $5-6 each, and all tasted about the same. Many of the rolls come stuffed with cream cheese. The main flavor difference between them was whether a fried ingredient was also included. Vegetables, too, added a little variation -- the asparagus offered texture. Many of the rolls promise \"crab,\" but the cashier told me that the rolls include imitation crab meat. The seaweed salad had a tasty sesame oil dressing. It made a nice contrast as a side. Two of us shared one portion (priced around $6).The free fried eggroll, a small complementary item, that came with our rolls was not very good. It was room temperature and oily.The restaurant is clean, but extremely plain and spare.",

I tried their yakisoba and as far as cheap Asian-y takeout-y noodles go, I can't believe I'm saying this, Chopstix does it better. It's edible though so whatever. Lol.Their sushi rolls were a huge disappointment :c. I got the Palatine Roll. First thing I noticed: they don't know how to roll their rolls. Everything was loose and falling apart. The rice wasn't packed well and it just looked like some amateur rolled it in the dark. With no hands.Second, the pieces of fish were miserly thin. I've only had thinner pieces at My Thai, which is the worst restaurant that I've ever been to in my life (Not just sushi restaurants. I'm talking out of ALL restaurants). Most of the roll was rice or veggies (not even the avocado kind of veggie). Sushi Ichiban engages in the practice of using rice as one of their fillings for an inside-out roll. That means that the rolls are double-stuffed with rice, which I hate because they're cheaping out on you and trying to make it seem like it's all cool. It left me feeling played like they didn't even try. I've been to plenty of cheap ass sushi places that do not double stuff.The only positive is that it tasted pretty good. I've had some awful sushi and this sushi is not at that level. It's pretty yummy, honestly. But... how many offensive  flavors can cheap, white rice really have...",

Instead, I was thrown off the minute I opened the bag. Instead of sushi soy sauce, it was just plain, cheap soy sauce, which is never a good omen. If you're going to name your restaurant \"Sushi... -anything-\" it's probably a good idea to actually provide the right condiments. The quality of the rolls were really poor. They were sloppy, falling apart, and some were sliced paper thin, while others were so large I couldn't even eat them without making a huge mess. The smoked salmon tasted like it had been soaked in liquid smoke instead of actually smoked. It was sour, fishy, and really terrible. The roll that was supposed to have tobikio on it had maybe 3 eggs per piece, which was terribly upsetting because it was the whole reason I'd decided on the roll.The only thing I enjoyed was the mini egg roll I received. It was hot, crispy, and quite honestly, really delicious. Maybe their regular menu is better, but I will definitely not be ordering sushi from here again.",

I sat back up after twenty minutes and found blood spewing out of my anus. As well, I started to feel something crawling up my throat. Before I knew it I was hurling throw up for minutes. Before coming to Sushi Ichiban make sure you take precautions. Make sure you have your cell phone in hand in case you have to call 911 at any given time.",

We are in the middle of nowhere - fish can't exactly be delivered and prepared on the same day, so don't go in expecting something fancy. Like its rating, it's A-OK sushi. Sushi Ichiban has a huge menu though, and they offer Chinese food along with a wide range of sides, appetizers, and drinks. You can even get packaged food to go if you're in a rush.I only go here when I feel a craving for sushi and want to go all out with the all-you-can-eat offer. It's $25/person and you get a menu to mark what you want. Then they bring out your order and when you're done, you can ask for another sheet to order more. The number of choices is quite large and chances are you'll find something you like. I enjoy the sweet potato roll, the Las Vegas roll, New York roll, and the Bubba Gump roll the most. They sometimes look good, but sometimes they look hastily made and are unevenly cut/fall apart. I also hate it when they cram the rolls full of veggies/rice and only a small bit of fish. The miso soup is okay though.Tip: The raw tuna they use sometimes tastes bad, so eat at your own risk. It's not worth getting something like the spicy tuna roll and having to eat it or pay the $1/piece left uneaten fine. My tuna roll had a strange, fishy taste and the color was a dull reddish-brown with a glossy sheen to it.Waiter service: almost non-existent. You get water by yourself (grab a pitcher if you have a big party), and the only service is when they bring you your sushi. There is one Caucasian waiter who is really nice and dedicated to good service. He jokes around, is totally friendly, and he works really hard. I dislike the Chinese waiter though because my boyfriend and I were eating together and he gave our order to another couple who didn't even look like us. He literally decided to give it to the first table of two he saw. After a long wait, I asked him about my bf's order because I overheard the couple picking at the rolls and saying they weren't sure if this was their order. He says, \"Oh, I gave it to that table.\" No apology or anything. We had to reorder and wait even longer for his order to come out. They also messed up my order and out of the three rolls I ordered, they completely forgot to give me my third one. As a poor student, I guess this is the highlight of my sushi experience when I want okay sushi, but don't want to splurge.",

The place would definitely benefit from some minor renovation...it has this almost kind of like \"Panda Express\" feel to it. I dunno, not a fan of that aspect considering it's a one-of-one as far as I know. It is what it is, but it could be nicer, hip-er even, with not a lot of effort.P.S. This is where I made my discovery that (since they are super stingy with the sweet sauce) mixing Sriracha with soy sauce is a pretty dang delicious dipping sauce for tempura. I did appreciate that they had a big bottle of hot sauce on every table.",

Oy, this better be good sushi-- and it was just okay.I got the sweet potato tempura and tuna roll. The sweet potato roll was good, though not the best I've ever tasted. I wanted more than fried tempura shrimp in rice and seaweed-- rather too simple from the others that I have tried. The tuna roll left something to be desired-- the tuna was not fresh and lacked a natural \"tuna\" taste I oh so love. Both of the rolls were sloppily made-- both of the rolls were uneven and had more stuffing in others. I like food to be quick, but I also value what I eat. Two more minutes wouldn't have killed me.The free egg roll that came with my meal was small and was seriously cold. Not worth eating. I have a few more days in Champaign, and rather than going there one more time, I will stick to Sushi Rock.",

There's only one roll I've had here which I didn't like, and that's not because it was poorly made or anything; I just didn't like the flavor (the Texas Scorpion, in case you're wondering).  I tend to prefer fancy rolls, but most of the specialty rolls here are pretty similar, and I'd prefer some variety.I always get a ton of yellowtail when I go, though.  It's pretty tasty.",

But places like Kame help to ease the pain. Some of the other reviews talking about the (lack of) freshness confuse me. I've never had anything but fresh sushi there, and I've been many times. If you're in town and you get a craving for good sushi make sure to check this place out.",

Not very green.I noted the interior and tables/chairs are worn and dated, so it could use a refresh.  I'm glad to have tried Kame, but would return to Sakanaya or Kofusion for my future Asian food cravings.",

Sushi Kame has the best Fried Rice. The rice had a coating of egg which is so hard to come by and had great veggies within it also. I was more than please with this restaurant and i will be more than happy to eat there again. The service was also good.",

My only minor complaint is that they often seem understaffed, and the poor servers seem a bit overworked during dinner.  But they are  unfailingly kind, and the food is always delicious.",

                "review": "After a recent visit to Sushi Kame, I thought I would update my review with even more positive, tasty comments and suggestions.  First (and this is kind of a silly compliment), I was impressed by their spicy tuna roll.  Most places use older, leftover pieces of fish to make spicy rolls, hoping that diners will overlook the borderline-spoiled fish once its been finely chopped and masked with mayonnaise and chili.  Compare that shady technique with the way it's done at Sushi Kame, where the chef applies the spicy sauce alongside WHOLE slices of tuna (not that minced stuff).  You can still appreciate the freshness of the fish without having it saturated in a misleading sauce.  As far as I'm concerned, the spicy rolls at Sushi Kame are totally legitimate.As usual, I was also delightfully surprised by some of the offerings on their \"daily specials\" menu.  For my appetizer, I asked for the takoyaki (a regional specialty from Osaka that consists of octopus encased in pan-fried bread).  This made me giddy with foodie glee--this dish is relatively rare in the United States, and much more so in the Midwest.  The takoyaki came topped with a classic Otafuku sauce and katsuobushi shavings (dried bonito flakes).  While not perfect, I give Sushi Kame props for serving a Japanese street dish and some delicacies beyond the usual expected fare at Japanese restaurants.Unfortunately, I don't think they offer the daily specials menu everyday (ironic?).  I think it's only available on certain nights during the week, but if you happen to receive that small, hand-written insert in your menu, I would definitely give some of their other dishes consideration.",

Boy was I wrong.It started off bad, we waited at the front for a while before being seated, then waited... and waited... and after maybe 20 minutes we were given our menus. After ordering a bento box, a bowl of yaki soba, and a small appetizer, we started our next wait. After an outrageous 30 minutes, our appetizer came out, tasted alright, but the 30 minute wait for that was not acceptable. (it was the korokke, I can't imagine that taking very long to make). Then we waited another 30 minutes for our main course. I had to ask the staff for an update, since they never even spoke to us after we made our order.Well now we got our food at least right? Well I wish that was the end of it all.The food was terrible.My beef yaki soba was tiny and there was barely any meat in it at all.  Curl your pointer finger to the tip of your thumb. The empty area between your fingers can fit all the meat that was in the dish. The meat that was in it had NO flavor at all. It was as if they forgot to add anything, not even salt.The noodles tasted alright, but they were nothing special, average at best. My girlfriend got the salmon bento box. The piece of salmon in it was tiny as well, and was so salty she couldn't eat it after the first two bites. Same goes for the veggies that were soaked in that sauce. The rice in the bento was probably the best part of the whole meal, and it felt like they didn't add quite enough water to it.After being first ignored by a waiter when I tried to get my check, we got to wait another 15-20 minutes before it was brought to us. Awful experience. Not even considering giving them a second try after that (and I'm usually willing to try every place at least twice) Stay away",

I have gone twice and each time ordering something a little different and I can only offer praise to this restaurant.I once asked for a chicken tempura which was not on the menu but they went ahead and made it for me. It was really good so I am puzzled why they do not put it on the menu at some point. Their teriyaki glaze is quite good: not too salty but not too sweet. I also like the cut-up vegetables they put alongside it. The yakisoba is great too with a little more noodle than veggie and/or meat. The sushi, while I chose the tame Tuna roll, was very tasty and well wrapped. It tasted fresh and I felt like I did not have to pay an arm and a leg like I would elsewhere. The miso soup was also likeable and that is a big compliment from me because usually I am not a big fan of miso.Anyway, give this place a try. Definitely worth the trek downtown and it is the right price range for a college student.",

Before eating, you always get the miso soup and cucumber salad.  With the lunch bento boxes, you also get a ginger salad, a few pieces of tempura, some caliifornia rolls, your entree choice, and some rice.   The best choices are the sushi and the calimari, I think, but it's all really good.  The prices are very reasonable, too - about $7-8 for all that food.The soups are massive and very good, too.  I am not sure if there is anything better for a cold winter day or if you aren't feeling good.For dinners, there are meals like the bento boxes or sushi.  I've never been disappointed with the sushi here, either and it is definitely some of the very best I've had in the midwest.  They do not skimp on the fish, either - with the nigiri, there is always plenty of delicious fish.  Prices are reasonable, especially for what you get.This was the first place I had uni, the delicious creamy sea urchin.  It's a little scary looking  at first, but it is incredibly good if you are feeling adventurous.I've never ordered dessert because I've always been too full from the entrees.I have been here many, many times and the only time the service was slow at all was on a busy Saturday night.  Generally, service is quick and attentive.  Decor is not overdone.Like I said - one of my favorite restaurants in town, and definitely my favorite sushi place.",

I don't like Yellowfin (inconsistant with freshness), I don't like Sushi Rock or Sushi Avenue (both cheap but neither tastes very good), I definitely don't like Kamakura (bad service and crappy food), I don't like Miso (Urbana...across from Carle??), Oishi is ok (#2 on my list for sushi, but a very distant #2 -- they get points for creativeness and plating) and Kofusion is local but is very over rated ($1 sushi night on Monday is ok, but most selections are cooked and have either cream cheese or something \"tempura\" worked into it one way or another).  And it still stands that there is no good gyoza in Champaign.... no one pan fries them properly... they're usually very soggy and the filling sucks.  Better off to make your own.They have bento boxes for about $10-$13 for lunch.  They start you off with a cold noodle dish (very good) and some miso soup.... I had my one year old son with me once, and they brought out more tofu cubes for him.... he gobbled them all down saying, \"More cheese! More cheese!!!\" (whatever gets him to eat tofu! LOL).   The fish is good -- I mean, it's not the kind of fresh fish that you'd get in Tokyo or NYC, but it is GOOD.  The rice is seasoned well.   The tempura in the box is also very good -- not a heavy breading like other restaurants have.   I came in the other day at 1pm and it was BUSY.  The busiest I've ever seen.  There was only one waitress.... but the service was OUTSTANDING for it being one service.  She had some sort of system down because she had it down -- no one was left waiting or fuming.  Water glasses were kept filled, food was hot (or room temperature if you ordered sushi), food was prompt, checks were dealt with fast and I was left dumbfounded -- I couldn't believe how wonderful the service was that day -- I mean, I didn't want the waitress chit chatting with me but for the amount of tables she was dealing with, it was excellent.  I tipped her well that day..... and this is why I gave this restaurant five stars today..... usually it would be about a four star.... but her service (and I believe she is either the wife of the owner or at least a long standing waitress) was impeccable.",

The restaurant was not very busy for a Friday lunch time. There seemed to be one cook and one server running the place and we had no waiting. There were several people coming in to pick up carry out orders, too.  We will give them another try and be more adventurous in our selections.",

SIXTEEN dollars.  yep.  apparently inari rolls now have gold flecks in them or something, because in a little over two weeks the price skyrocketed by $10.  i brought it to said stressed out older lady, because she had taken my to-go order.  she just kept repeating that it was \"today's price\".  she totally seemed angry and upset that i had even asked.  i had though.  because....listen, lady... i don't think tofu has a market price like seafood.  even if it does... it's f'n tofu.  no one had to go out on the wild seas and wrangle it.  i paid it.  for some reason two cucumber rolls, an order of fried rice, and 4 inari rolls came to a little under $30 that day.  i gave that rude lady $16.... and i hated every minute of it and every minute of eating what now felt like total rip off inari.i haven't been back since that.  it's a shame too.  the food is really not so bad.  not gold plated tofu prices, but good enough.",

I lived in Japan for 9 weeks a couple years ago and understand the quality of food and service that you get there, but I certainly wouldn't hold restaurants in Champaign to that same standard. This is a small University town and access to fresh seafood is limited at best.Having said that, I was rather underwhelmed by Sushi Kame. The server (a middle-aged Korean lady) was very demanding and impatient. My girlfriend takes a long time to decide what she wants and when we were given the extensive menu, I knew it would be a while. So I asked the server if we could order the egg yolk sauce with rice dish side-dish while we looked at the menu. She gave me a very accusing look, as though I was committing some sort of crime, and then scampered off to put the order in.When she returned,  I attempted to order several more authentic Japanese items like [kama] toro, uni, and oyster, only to find none of these were \"in season\". We settled on a special spicy salmon roll, the green turtle roll, and several pieces of nigiri.As others have mentioned before, the egg yolk sauce with rice was really delicious. It is very rich, so you will need to share it with someone. The sushi was rather ordinary (by Champaign standards). The rolls fell apart prematurely indicating the rice did not have the right consistency/stickiness. The ginger was mild in flavor, the wasabe obviously dyed horseradish, and I swear they served regular soy sauce, not the special variety for sushi, because it was extremely salty.I can't comment on other dishes on the menu, and they may be delicious, but I'm not likely to come here again. For me the rudeness of the server coupled with the subpar sushi was enough to deter me from this restaurant.",

Regardless, I yelped to my heart's content and settled on Sushi Kame.To start, when I looked at the menu I was shocked at the prices.  They were charging $4.50 for a bowl of edamame and some of their other appetizers and sushi rolls were just way overpriced.The miso soup was very bland and the barely filled up half the bowl.  I work at a sushi restaurant and our miso soup isn't amazing or anything but it has flavor to it that the miso soup at Sushi Kame was lacking.  As for the portion size, I just didn't understand why they couldn't fill up that extra portion of the bowl...Next, the house salad.  The dressing is a staple that I've tasted at many Japanese restaurants and this one was just too sour and I couldn't take more than one bite.Now, the main course.  I ordered the Love-Love roll and the Sushi Special, which comes with 5 pieces of nigiri and a california roll.  I'm not a fan of the california roll so I asked the server to replace it with a spicy tuna roll and that I would gladly accept any upcharges.  She didn't know how much it would be so I asked her to just let me know.  She came back and informed me that it would be $0.25 extra.  She then returned 2 minutes later saying that it would actually be $1.00.  Now I wouldn't have minded paying that if she told me that from the beginning.  But it seems to me that if you're going to tell a customer a certain price for something you shouldn't go back on it...that was a little off-putting.  My love-love roll was okay, but the cilantro was a little overpowering.  I don't know if i would use whole leaves of cilantro in one roll..and the spicy tuna that came with my sushi special, well..it was one of the worst spicy tuna rolls I've ever seen or tasted in my life.  It had no flavor to it, and it was falling apart.  It was basically like the sushi chef put a piece of tuna and a little spicy mayo over it.  Again, because I work in a sushi restaurant I know that it takes a bit more preparation than that to make a spicy tuna roll.  And if you can't manage to make a simple roll like that, I don't know what that says about your skills.  The only thing that I enjoyed about my meal was the nigiri as the fish was fresh.Needless to say, I will not be returning.",

I understand this is a lot of sushi to make, but it took about 25 minutes to get our food. I wished that the sushi was chilled a little more, but it was just made. I am not a fan of miso soup, but my friends liked theirs. I also  had the cucumber noodles. I was not a fan of them. We ordered the avocado role, two salmon rolls (one spicy and one mild), and and shrimp roll. They were all good. I did not have a problem with the fish being \"rancid\" like many other reviews.

It was so spicy, you couldn't even taste any flavors of the roll... which completely defeats the purpose of sushi. The edamame was good but grossly overpriced at $3 for a tiny little bowl. The tempura sampler dish was really tasty and priced fairly. It took forever to get service any single time we needed anything, even though there was almost no one in the restaurant when I came one weekday night. I came here with my mom and sister based on Yelp reviews hoping to explore some new joints in the Champoobanana area and was immensely disappointed. I'll stick with Kofusion for all my Champaign sushi desires.",

As a previous reviewer said, service isn't always the best, but, in my experience, that's only been in terms of table visits by the waitstaff (they seem to get overwhelmed easily). Having said that, they have always been friendly and our food has always been quick to the table.Oh, and they close for a few hours between lunch and dinner, so be sure to call ahead if you're not sure if they're open yet.",

They start you out with a free cucumber and somen noodle salad.  It's small, but very appetizing.  I still can't figure out exactly what the dressing is, but I always drink the extra.  After that they give you a (also free) miso soup, which is pretty good as far as miso soup goes.    Oh, and the green tea is free and they use real matcha as far as I can tell.  It's got a really nice, light, floral taste.I've also been to Yellowfin a few times.  While Yellowfin is good, the reason that I like Sushi Kame more is probably their \"American Sushi\" combo.  For about $14, you get three pieces of salmon nigiri, three tuna nigiri, a salmon roll, and the house salad, which is lettuce with ginger dressing.  The slabs of fish on the nigiri are nicely cut and usually pretty thick, giving the sushi a rice-to-fish ratio that definitely favors the fish.   Speaking of the fish, it has always been fresh and clean-tasting, never \"fishy.\"  Admittedly, I've only had non-midwest sushi once, so my basis for comparison is only other sushi in Illinois.  When it comes to maki, I usually stick with the simpler stuff that lets you taste the fish more, so I can't offer much of an opinion on the super tempura fried california rolls or whatever.  The unagi rolls are good though.I've had the sea urchin here as well, and while it's softer than the stuff at Yellowfin, there's also more of it and it tastes really, really good.",

I do enjoy their appetizers- the miso soup and the cold noodles. I wish I knew how to make those. As for the ambiance, it's comfortable. It's good for dates or meetings. That said, it's a little more chaotic on really busy days. Expect the sushi to take a while especially when everybody else is ordering them. The service is fine as well.

The service was quick and the restaurant was clean as usual. The bento boxes came with a lot of rice, two pieces of California rolls, salad, and tempura. Everything was delicious and the pork and steak were really juicy. Prior to getting our food, we were served a complimentary miso soup and cucumber noodles.Besides that, I want to really highlight the golden scallops! While Sushi Kame is a sushi restaurant, don't neglect the rest of the menu - ORDER THIS!! It's soooo yummy! The menu description is \"sea scallops topped with light egg sauce\" which sounds uninteresting, but it's definitely worth ordering. The menu literally does this appetizer no justice. Served on a lovely shell, slices of scallop are baked with Kewpie mayo giving it a melt-in-your-mouth texture and savory, yet sweet taste. It's covered in a light egg sauce and there's also a side of it that comes with it. The salty flavor and creamy feeling of the extra sauce really compliments the scallops. Pretty to look at and great to eat! Sharing may not be possible even with the large amount of scallops - I really devoured this! While Sushi Kame is off-campus and less accessible than Sakanaya, I love it so much!",

Unfortunately, it sells out very fast and they don't always have it made - so I always make sure to call beforehand to make sure its in stock. Several times, they told me that they did and when I arrived, I learned that they had lied. So be careful.Their sushi is pretty decent quality, but nothing extraordinary. Its a bit on the expensive side and the rolls are somewhat bland, but if you know how to order correctly, you can get a great meal. I'd suggest getting either the Love Love Roll or the Vienna Roll, which comes with miso soup and a small cucumber salad. Then I usually get a house salad (it comes with a very good ginger sauce) and a side of golden rice. It comes to about $13 and leaves you filled to the brim - making Sushi Kame my favorite sushi place in Champaign.",

Also the people are very polite. You can't go wrong with any of the items on the menu. If you would like a warm soup for you meal, go for the Udon soup (I believe it's $2.00 for one tempura shrimp to be added with the soup). If you want something with a little bit of everything, the bento box consist of the meat and served with 1 roll of California tempura, salad, and rice. More importantly, the sushi is great and they never run out of fish!",

Another 20 minutes to get our 4 waters, then we tried to order, but she ran away. Flagged her down and put in our order another 10 minutes later, then started making bets to see how long it would take to get our food. Mind you, we were already there for 55 minutes with only water. Needless to say, we all were under. It took them, I believe, 57 minutes to bring out 2 rolls, sashimi, and soup. ...but there were 4 of us. Our fourth order didn't come in until after everyone had already made a dent in their food (he felt bad and didn't want us to wait until he got his food). I was so angry, I can't even remember how the sushi tasted. We also didn't receive that cucumber salad thing that every other table received, and only got our miso soup upon flagging her down. We TRIED to be patient, we TRIED to get attention from any waitress we could, but nothing. I felt I should express how completely dissatisfied I was with the service to the manager, so I did (very kindly, btw). She responded with something along the lines of, well you didn't make reservations, then continued to say that because we hadn't made reservations, they're not obligated to cater to us as quickly as the customers that did. ...REALLY?Moral of the story? ...make reservations or you'll get treated like garbage here.",

Between my friends and I, we ordered rolls of spicy tuna, negi hemachi (sp), unagi, dragon, shrimp tempura, and crab. Everything tasted great. However, I personally liked the dragon, unagi, and spicy tuna above the others. It can become a little pricey but it is worth it for good sushi in this town.

I was trying to find a really nice fancy place with good authentic sushi, good service and acceptable prices. I was ready to pay much.First, service could be better: in the beginning the waitress handed in with her two fingers some cold dirty towels, instead of brining them on the dish, hot and carefully rolled. Second, all rolls and soy sauce are impossibly salty, which is nonsense for Japanese food. Rice is dry, tobiko looks like scraps, and salmon in phili rolls is way too smoked. They have only one kind of tea, which is tasteless. They do not have any big combos with all kinds of nigiri, sashimi, maki, etc. to try everything. Also, they do not serve any veggie sides. As a result, this place is greatly overpriced.Pluses:- good ginger; they give about three pieces of it, but can bring more upon request; same with wasabi.- they refill your tea-cups.- nigiri-sushi are really nice: fat and delicate salmon and tuna. - nice and quiet atmosphere.So, imho, one should go there and eat as much nigiri as one can. This is definitely the best food they have in their restaurant.If you also bring your own soy sauce, it could be of some use too. =))",

I went with the Maki Combo off the lunch menu which included a spicy tuna roll and a California roll. The Cali was ok but I have never seen a Spicy tuna roll with so little tuna and a big wedge of avocado?  I know...avacado!!Next time I want an avocado roll w extra rice and a dash of spicy tuna, this is my place....otherwise there are many other sushi places that care about serving quality food. This place disappoints big time. Look at the photo. What a joke!!",

If you're going for lunch the bento boxes are hard to beat when it comes to bang for your buck! I've always been happy with the food. The service is OK, I've never had the long wait times that some others here have posted about. I guess my only complaint is that I tried the Chirashizushi once and while it was good propotions and delicious it was one of the less ornate presentations I've had. Of course for the price I couldn't really complain. So yeah- if you're in the CU area and looking for sushi, this is one of the two places I would recommend!",

The kitchen was keeping up excellently with our staggered ordering.The vibe inside feels, oddly, much more like a Mexican restaurant.",

Champaign is a true University town (unlike faux places like Duluth) and it offers a wide variety of local restaurants and great coffee shops.  Having a second craving for sushi, I stopped by Sushi Kame to see if it would be a good option should I wind up living there.   The place was small and pretty empty as the University was on spring break, but the sushi was very good.  The spicy tuna hand roll was clean and layered (opposed to mixing chunks of ahi with the ubiquitous spicy sauce),  I also had the tempura scallop roll, which was awesome! Again clean flavor and the scallop was noticeably fresh.   I had  a few other simple pieces and each one was well prepared.  I would definitely recommend Sushi Kame to anybody looking for a solid roll.",

That the sushi was relatively cheap only made the experience even better.The interior is unassuming, which is fine, because it usually means good things for the food. The Nigiri was quite good, and the sweet rice was cooked perfectly. The rolls we had were Crunch (good flavor with a good crunch), sweet potato (best tempura-based roll I've had), Alaska (pretty good, I don't remember much of it, though), green turtle (better than the Crunch) and volcano (not nearly as spicy as it should be).I sort of wished the soy sauce wasn't just salty (it tasted like the stuff that comes out of the bottles at standard Chinese restaurants). Some of the rolls could have been a bit more flavorful. Overall, though, I'd definitely go back to Sushi Kame when I'm in town.",

The bento box is huge! and it has a bit of everything... some salad, assorted tempura, rice, california rolls (that can be replaced with any of their regular rolls with a small charge). Definitely don't recommend the bento box if you just want a light dinner. Luckily, I was really hungry so it was perfect for me! I ordered the Tonkatsu (Deep fried pork) bento box while my mom ordered the salmon teriyaki bento box. My tonkatsu bento box was really good except for the one piece of ebi (shrimp) tempura. I don't know how to describe but it just tasted really weird. I think they don't let the oil drip and dry after they deep fry the shrimp so it doesn't get nice and crispy. Instead, it was kind of soggy which was disappointed. Also their Tonkatsu sauce tasted funny. I don't know if they make their own sauce but it definitely didn't taste like traditional tonkatsu sauce. My mom's salmon teriyaki was delicious! Salmon was cooked so nicely and it came with sauteed vegetables as well. Between the salmon teriyaki and the tonkatsu, I'd definitely say the salmon was the better choice! The good thing about sushi kame was the service. Our server was really helpful and nice. She recommend the love roll to me in replacement of the california roll and what a great recommendation it was! Overall, I was very satisfied.. oh, did i mention that a bento box is only 12 dollars? All that food for 12 dollars!!!!! Amazing. Definitely will come back again soon.",

In a small city called Champaign, isolated in the middle of the United States, far away from any ocean body, the people at Sushi Kame conjures up some of the best sushi I have ever had.  In the middle of freakin Illinois, who would've thought.  My roommates and I were feigning for some sushi and decided to try out this place, what a great surprise.  Its a small joint, nothing fancy, with cute waitresses and cheap dining furniture.  But who gives a damn, they make the best Uni and salmon nigiri.  My all time favorite sushi is the uni (sea urchin).  Every place I have been to, except for one, had uni that tasted really fishy.  And I hate that!  But this place had the most buttery, savory, fresh uni that I have ever had.  It was so good, I ordered 12 uni nigiri pieces the third time I went.  The second time I went they had ran out of uni, crushing my delicate little heart into tiny tiny pieces.    The food is great, my roommates ordered some rolls and teriyaki dishes which were all excellent.  The prices are very reasonable and service is good.  If your ever out here in this quaint little college town, Sushi Kame is a must.",

Very friendly, accommodating staff, too. My recommendations? Love love roll (obviously- see my pic), sake bomb, spicy crazy, sun set, crunch, & university (expensive, but wide roll with incredible flavor!). House salad always a must for maybe $2. Golden scallops app also delicious if you're looking for warm, creamy, buttery, savory. Come here for a nice, quiet date :)",

I get the tempura shrimp, which is tasty and last time I tried the sweet potato roll, which is surprisingly good since I never thought of eating sweet potato in sushi. It has a relaxed vibe, service is good and the sake is tasty--I couldn't ask for anything else!",

It was very good, and a nice gesture.- The maki we ordered (Spider, Silk Road, and Crazy rolls) were very tastyThe Not-as-Good- The space is small, so every time the door opened, freezing cold air blasted in- The waitress was understandably busy, as she was the only one working the whole restaurant, but this meant that she couldn't give much attention to any one table- The appetizer we ordered, shumai, was so close to being really tasty - it was five pork-filled dumplings with a wasabi sauce.  Now, I love wasabi, but it overwhelmed the sauce and made it difficult to taste the dumpling itself.- The maki was kind of...I don't know...sloppily-rolled?  Two of the three rolls we ordered were pretty big and tended to fall apart.Champaign isn't exactly a booming sushi metropolis, so I'll be back...hopefully they can bump my experience up a star!",

It was very sweet that they would give us free pumpkin soup, however I would much rather have never ever tasted it. I might have paid them not to give it to me had I known.That had me worried, but my worries dissipated when my shumai arrived with spring greens in this amazing sauce for $4.45. They were amazing, shrimp dumplings with just a tiny hint of oniony flavor. I ended up putting in a second order. I was also happy when my crispy shrimp roll arrived. I was nervous about spicy mayo as I HATE MAYONNAISE but it was delicious. They don't overload it w/mayo and the shrimp were great and the tempura crisps were awesome. After asking for our check, we were surprised to get a free dessert of tempura bananas and what i think was a tangerine but could have been a fresh mandarin orange? Again the sauce was awesome and so was the tempura. Plus, it was a tempura banana for pete's sake! I would have paid for this dessert.The food came out very quickly as compared to other sushi restaurants in town and would have been darn near perfect without the free pumpkin ash tray soup. (As a former smoker, I'm not exaggerating. If you want to lick an ash tray then have a bite of pumpkin you've got the idea of the soup).  The location is sneaky. Google it if you don't know the area, totally worth what I paid.",

                "review": "I've been going to Yellowfin as my \"sushi place\" (once every 2-3 weeks) for about a year. Initially, I was just happy to have an option that wasn't incredibly overpriced and over-focused on fancy tempura-laden rolls. Simple sushi is where its at, and its what they do well.Unfortunately, the quality of their food has only gone down, and after tonight I'm not going to be taking my business there anymore. We got into the restaurant around 6:50pm. Not peak dinner-time, but still kind of crowded in the small space. There was ONE waiter working the 6-7 tables there, and he was clearly being run ragged. He provided decent customer service given his situation, and was definitely handling it as well as he could.No amount of customer service can make up for crappy food and unsatisfying portions, though. The \"combo\" platters are little more than some type of protein (shrimp, scallops, chicken, beef, or tofu), and some vegetables thrown into a wok that might have had soy sauce in it at some point during the day. No kidding, I don't think there was even teriyaki sauce on there...just soy sauce. I can, and do, make better stir fry at home. Their sushi is small, but they serve it nice and cold, which is a step up from other restaurants in the area. The fish is of decent quality (re: it won't kill you), but today I noticed that the portions of fish had gotten even tinier over the last few months. I think the chef was slicing the fish in half lengthwise, it was so thin!They do not include soup and salad with your meal, unless it is one of the above-mentioned combo platters. This is garbage. Soup/salad is par for the course for most places now, and no amount of icky tempura-fried banana and slim pieces of fruit served as \"dessert\" can account for that. The salad dressing for the house salad tastes like water, and they use it like soup; my lettuce was SWIMMING. Pros: cold sushi, well-flavored rolls and nigiri, and a lot of optionsCons: # of waiters available, soup/salad for extra charge, super tiny portions, and very overpriced. I won't be back. There isn't much in the way of sushi in Chambana, but there is better than this.",

In short: rolls are great, nigiri is okay, bulgoogi is good but a little pricey.Overall, it's a solid place.  I still like Sushi Kame just a little better, but it's a lot closer than it used to be.  The rolls (maki) are the way to go here - they're really good, and there's some clever combinations.  The ume jiso is a sour paste, mint, and cucumber - it's awesome, the sour flavor is extremely intense and unlike any other sushi roll I've had.  The crazy roll is really good, too, and so is the unagi.  The tempura squid is also tasty.  The prices are pretty reasonable definitely in line with most of the other sushi places in C-U, and cheaper than Ko-fusion.  It's nice that they have a good selection of different entrees - even people who aren't crazy about raw fish can find something to eat here.I do not recommend the nigiri (where you get a piece of fish on top of a little \"cake\" of pressed rice) so highly.  My girlfriend and I split a Sushi special and the amount of wasabi on some of the rolls was overwhelming.  I like wasabi, but there shouldn't be so much on the nigiri when it comes out that your sinuses burn and your eyes tear up.  It really overwhelms the flavor of the fish at that point.  At first we thought it was because they were so busy, but a friend got the same thing on our second visit, and there was still too much wasabi.  Also, though the sushi special gives you a lot of pieces for the price, there were some repeats - 2 shrimp, and 2 tilapia, which I think are some of the cheaper fish.  Neither was all that flavorful.  Because of this, I think Sushi Kame is still better when it comes to nigiri.The bulgoogi is good, and comes out with veggies - looked like carrots, zucchini, mushrooms, onions.  However, at $14 it seems a little pricey.  I didn't have it, but another friend got the teriyaki chicken, and the portion was very large.They do some special things like bring out complementary seafood pancakes before the meal, and desserts like tempura bananas and oranges.  That is nice.  Service really depends on who's working and how busy they are.  It's generally not really fast - I only saw the one sushi chef working when I was there - so that's something to be prepared for.  One friend was there for her birthday, and they brought out little candles stuck in wasabi for her, so that was a nice touch.If you like sushi and you stick with the rolls, you'll get the most out of this place.  I recommend the rolls pretty highly - they're probably the best I've had in town, and like I said, prices are reasonable. They're also one of the few sushi or Asian restaurants open on Monday, which is nice to know when your week is off to a bad start and you really want a sushi fix.",

Here's why Yellowfin gets 2 stars:-The size of the nigirizushi was small, particularly the rice.  The cut of the fish was fine, but the rice underneath was way too small.-The rice was sloppily formed.  The rolls had rice poking out from both ends past the seaweed and the nigirizushi rice was not properly formed.  Now, this isn't to say that the rolls didn't taste good, because they did; however, presentation is very important when is comes to Japanese cuisine.-The nigirizushi was placed on top of a bamboo leaf.  Now this looked nice, but bamboo leaves have a very distinct taste and it definitely added a strange flavor to the nigirizushi rice.-The sushi platters did not come with miso soup or a salad.  This should be included in the meal because Japanese meals don't just consist of one large plate.  There are always small elements to be included, like a salad or soup.  These you had to pay extra for for a ridiculous price for its size.  This I disliked more than anything.Anyways, I hope this review helps.",

One had been hesitant to eat here as last time he had found a bone in his sushi, but we figured 'hey, it happens!' and gave yellowfin a chance.  Worst.  Decision. Ever.  Between the three of us we found 4+ bones in our sushi.   The sushi was painfully average and the ratio of wasabi to rice in the nigiri was either too weak or too strong.  Speaking of wasabi, theirs had this weird gritty consistency to it - kind of like when you make a paste with flour.  And it was really, really weak.  Ick. I'm not even sure the agedashi tofu we ordered contained tofu - it was this weird mess of over fried... something?  batter? panko? And resembled little crumpled piece of paper.  Yeah no.  Not good.We were seated at the bar which also doubled as the area where food was served from.  It was interesting to see the number of orders that had to be brought back or changed because the chef had forgotten something.  It was extra interesting to watch the plates get passed over my friend's head while we are trying to have dinner. Our server ensured we had plenty of time to talk by being completely inattentive.  It took him easily 15-20 minutes just to take our order and then we waited... and waited... and waited for the food to come out.  Thankfully my friends are good company or the wait would have been excruciatingly painful.  The one time he did check up on us we mentioned all the bones we had found and his response was to nod, do a little laugh, shrug and walk off.  Right.  I must have missed that becoming an appropriate reaction.  My bad.All in all a bad experience.  Never again.",

After reading some good reviews on Yelp, ordered the Pork ramen. I was starry eyed and dreaming about delicious, shoyu ramen with slices of pork belly. And... when the dish finally arrived what did I see? A spicy broth? That's... somewhat strange for ramen. But I'll eat it. What about the noodles? Clearly instant.... Two lonely pieces of shrimp and some hard, overcooked chunks of pork that had no flavor whatsoever. The broth tasted exactly like that of Shin ramyun. For a $11 price tag, I expect more than some instant ramen. I can get that at home.We did also try some of the sushi which was definitely better than some other options near campus. But overall, with the high prices, and the food only being marginally better... we won't be back.",

It's true that sometimes servers have bad days and are grumpy, and that's no problem, we've all been there.  There are also sometimes mistakes in food, and likewise, a chef or sushi chef could be having a bad day.Still... when I was serve edamame in my lunch bento... and there were literally maggots coming out of the edamame... i was pretty horrified.  It was definitely one of those situations where you know the food is old.  The edamame was lifeless, brown, old.  And to my surprise, there were maggots in it having at it.So being as tempered as possible, I alerted the server who apologized and took it away.  I was expecting one of two things... 1, the server (or owner) will come to the table, apologize, and comp my meal.  2, nothing will happen until I receive the check, and the meal will be comped on there with some kind of apology note.By the time the check came, neither of the two happened.  Giving the restaurant one more chance to make right their wrong, I politely asked if I could get my meal comped since there were maggots in my food.  The server responded politely that the owner said there was no way for anyone to know there were maggots in the edamame.  Even though the edamame was all pretty much opened up with maggots coming out of them when it reached the table in the first place.So... there you go, I gave every chance for them to make right their wrong.  Suffice it to say that getting maggots in your food is a totally unacceptable situation, they took it 3 steps too far by doing nothing about it before the check, on the check, or after the check.  By principle alone, and from fear that the rice, or even fish are likely aging beyond their safe tolerance levels, yellowfin gets a 0 star if I could give them one for committing egregious health code violations, and donig nothing about it.",

They also serve sushi in to-go ramekins rather than pouches.  Just a little like of mine :)  Those pouches are never enough!

The only complaint that I have is that they only have one chef, and one night I had to wait almost an hour for my appetizer because they had a 12+ people order placed online ahead of mine. They were very apologetic and gave me a free roll. However, I left after the appetizer (and free roll), and I had planned on spending at least $30 more dollars.

                "review": "I was waffling between a 4 and a 5 on this place out of the 3 times I've been here, but last night really pushed me to a 5! We came for a birthday party (we had a reservation for 6.. but it wound up being 8 and they accommodated us with no questions asked.. +1!) at around 6 on a Saturday, and there were only 2 other tables seated in the restaurant. Service started out a little shaky (our waiter was quite young), but nothing to complain about, really. Once we were all seated and had our orders placed, the evening just went really smoothly (which is really how parties at restaurants should be, I think). Though the rolls took a while to come out (we all ordered sushi in one form or another), we were sent out first a round of complimentary miso soup, and then trays of beautifully presented banchan (or Japanese food presented in banchan style). Our sushi came out pretty much all at the same time (though the waiter forgot one of my friend's second roll order until the end). I've only had the sushi here, so I can't speak for the hot food, but it is very fresh tasting and has clean flavor profiles. It seems to be that the majority of the rolls are dominated by fish and veggies rather than cream cheese/tempura style rolls, which is a nice break from some of the other restaurants in town. In my opinion, the rolls are on the pricey side ($6 for a simple maki to avg $13 for a 'special'), but I come from the land of cheap fish, so Yellowfin is competitive for the market in town. Finally, the chef sent out some tempura bananas topped with mango sauce and caramel. If you've not had a tempura banana, you're really missing out! I guess what impressed me the most was 1) how seamless the service integrated with the table's needs and 2) the effort put into the presentation and quality of the food. We were able to enjoy our night out without having to worry too much about really anything.. everything just flowed. The sushi was beautifully presented, with beautiful pieces of fish as well as intricately carved garnishes.Bottom line: When a sushi craving hits any day other than a Sunday or Monday, I'll be headed to Yellowfin",

I love how the place isn't really located in a very commercial area.. which makes the place a true hidden gem and you gotta look for it. The place is small, gives you that at home feel for some reason. The waitress is extremely sweet and nice, so does the other staff. Rice quality is OK, they really hold the fish/shrimp and veggies together better than other japanese joints where their rice don't hold the content that very well. Sushi may take awhile if there are a lot of people since there's only 1 sushi chef, but very worth the wait. (Last time me and my sister went there, there were actually 2 of them. So maybe that will help the wait lol)Another favorite thing about this restaurant is how they give you free stuff on certain days. We got free seaweed salad, miso soup, tempura banana, and even a 6 pc sushi roll from the chef on different days! They got the best mochi ice cream ever, extremely cold but very good. Their fried rice is addicting for some reason, very different from all the stuff I've tasted.Teppan grill is good, although it seems like they kept changing the portion everytime we go there. Now when they serve the rice, they put it on the plate upside down when I really prefer it on the small bowl so I can \"cup\" it with my chopstick easily. I haven't tried their Korean items but will someday!I will always come back to this place and I can't wait to take my BF from Frisco here! :)",

The food wasn't bad either time, but I don't think it's a good value because of how expensive it is. A teriyaki combo which comes with salad and miso soup, is $18-22. Add in tax and tip and you're basically looking at around $25 for a plate of chicken teriyaki with rice. Again, I don't have complaints about the quality, but it's no better than chicken teriyaki you can get at various other places around town for less than half the price.Same thing about the sushi. You're looking at $19-22 for the sushi combos which come with 7-9 pieces (plus California roll) or 12 pieces of sushi (without roll). Nigiri sushi pieces range from $4 to $7, with my favorites like unagi being around $6. That's more expensive than I'm willing to pay. I think Sakanaya is a better deal.",

I've frequently been to Sakanaya on Green Street for sushi though since Sakanaya has been consistently good. When we went in, the decor was nice and clean. Very modern and Asian styled. We were immediately greeted by the waitress. It was a Saturday afternoon and the place wasn't very busy, only 2 other tables were filled. After being seated, we looked over the menus. A lot of the items seemed fairly priced, comparable to Sakanaya's prices, probably cheaper. The service was good. She gave us free bites of appetizers even though we didn't order any and free dessert (watermelon slices). She was very attentive and refilled our water when it was low. She definitely earned a hefty tip.The food was okay, which is why I brought it to the 3 star level. I ordered a sushi entree along with the New York roll and my friend got the bulgogi. The bulgogi was as good as any. The sushi had too much wasabi. The roll was slightly messy too, not neat and tight. If you're looking for a quick bite and for okay Asian food, I would go here. So long as you're not looking to wait at the long lines at Sakanaya, this would be my second choice.",

I saw a bunch of the positive reviews and negative reviews and decided to give this place a try. The service was nice and friendly which is a huge plus, but the rest was a big let down. Why may you ask...1. My wife got a dragon roll. It was the saddest dragon roll ever. Thinly sliced fish that had a very off color, not vibrant like you would expect and the roll itself was almost falling apart. Check the photos for yourself2. I got the chicken teriyaki with rice. Someone needs to check what the difference is with teriyaki and soy sauce. It felt like chinese stir fried chicken bits. Most japanese restaurants will not dice up the chicken into little cubes and then stir fry it in soy sauce. There was no sweet taste you would expect with real teriyaki sauce and this cost 17.95.... I feel very ripped off!Pro: free small appetizer was given (tempura battered banana and a fish cake of some sort), friendly serviceCons: EXPENSIVE, food is borderline average to belowHidden gem:None",

The menu is extensive, so you can bring your sushi-adverse friends and order soba or Korean BBQ. Service was attentive and in the end, the bill was surprisingly low. Too bad it's so out of the way.

Not too much to say about the place itself: the deco could definitely use more work, and it kind of looks like a cheap Chinese restaurant (with the exception of the sushi bar). But who really cares... The menu is pretty extensive, with mostly Japanese food (and a lot of sushi) but also some Korean items. I ordered the salmon teriyaki combo ($15), which turned out to be a lot more food than I expected: salmon filet and sauteed vegetable in teriyaki sauce, white rice, three pieces of sushi (tuna, salmon, shrimp), salad, a California roll, miso soup, and a scoop of ice-cream!! Needless to say I was full after finishing all that food. And while it wasn't necessarily exceptional, it was pretty good overall and I left satisfied. Not bad for the price.",

The waitress was very sweet and patient as we picked through their menu. We ordered the sushi appetizer which was a basic assortment of nigiri sushi, cucumber maki, and ahi maki. My dinner partner is not a fan of spice and we immediately noticed that the chef was spreading wasabi on every piece. I didn't mind it as much, but it really had a bad effect on them.We soldiered on and ordered a diverse combination of rolls. We tried a Philly roll, scallop nigiri, an avocado and eel roll, a Spider, and a few basic fish rolls. Overall it was passable sushi, but nothing to write home about. The amount of wasabi that permeated the night ended up overpowering a lot of the base flavors I crave. Also, I'm guessing we were getting the leftover stock from lunchtime. By the time we paid the place was filling up so maybe next time a wait will yield better food.Ultimately, it is worth a shot. I'm willing to head back, but I hope our experience was an anomaly.",

(I was a little disappointed this order doesn't include miso soup.) The yakisoba seemed a little heavy on grease and sauce but tasted fine. Although prices appeared reasonable, portions were tiny and barely satiating.Service is good. Our waitress tonight was friendly and attentive, and based on my past experiences here, this tends to be the norm.There's really nothing wrong with Yellowfin---it's very much a hidden gem and one of Champaign's top spots for Japanese cuisine. That said, nothing about this restaurant strikes me as exceptional, so I'm going to go with a solid four out of five stars.",

We really enjoyed the spicy tuna dish appetizer, and tempura appetizer.On the other hand, the green tea was not hot, barely warm. And, the combination of popularity, close tables, and hard surfaces made the place extremely noisy. Once the crowd died down and the restaurant was 1/3 full, conversation could again be carried on without shouting.This was probably our third time, and won't be the last. But, we'll try to go during off-peak hours to avoid the noise.",

I came with pretty high hopes for this place, especially since reviews are so good for them. The sushi is good, but not worth the ridiculous price tag it comes with. Each roll (eight small/medium pieces) was $11.50. Sushi is usually expensive, but come on, this is champaign urbana and even in high-priced Naperville you don't see these disgustingly high prices. 3 stars because they really need to lower their prices. Even miso soup is $2.50, which should tip you off right there that this place is overpriced. Save your money and eat somewhere else.",

I can only assume that there was a staffing crisis, because the next time I went, there were 2 waiters, and it was on a much less busy weekday night.We were immediately noticed and seated, and our order was taken promptly and cheerfully. Our appetizers came out really quick, then our food immediately afterwards. This was really fast, because let me tell you, when we order sushi, we order a TON. Like, surely-they're-making-fun-of-the-fat-Americans-back-in-the-kitchen amounts.  My only complaint for this visit was the noise level.  It seemed as though there was some kind of a reunion going on at the table next to ours, which had at least 10 people at it.  They were all getting pretty sauced and obnoxious.  This really wasn't the fault of the restaurant, but it's so small that they were drowning out our conversation, if not all of the conversations in the restaurant.All of the sushi was right on. It was expensive, but isn't it always?",

The prices are alright for sushi, but other menu items tend to be overpriced or underwhelming. I love, love, love the Philadelphia spring roll and Dragon sushi. Excellent presentation! They seem to occasionally bring out freebies to your table, my favorite of which is the tempura banana roll. The only thing that keeps me from giving them a 5 is the service. To be fair, I've only ever gone to Yellowfin as part of a larger party - 8-12 people. Every time, though, something has been.. off. First, out of four trips, we've been told twice that there weren't enough menus for everyone in our party, even though the restaurant wasn't even at half-capacity. The only times we've all gotten a menu is when there are only a couple other diners. Second, it takes a long time for a server to take orders, and even longer to actually get drinks to the table. I understand the food takes a while, and it's worth the wait. The sushi chef is very skilled at what he does. But there's no reason 8 people can't get soft drinks, tea and water within ten minutes of ordering when there are only 15 people total in the restaurant and at least two servers are working. Plus, I've never had refills on any drinks except water, when the menu does mention free refills on iced teas and sodas. I'll keep going back because the sushi is fantastic, but probably only on date nights or with a small group of friends.",

It's a little hard to find the place as it's attached to an Asian grocery store on the side of a larger grocery store's parking lot, but it's worth looking for. Everyone that I've recommended it to has been happy with it! I only have two complaints and they've got nothing to do with the food. The dining area is pretty much a big box with lots of hard surfaces and no real sound dampening, so when it gets crowded it can get pretty loud. Also, one Friday about 8 of us went there for lunch and the place was packed and it appeared that only 2 people were working there. It took about an hour from when we were seated until everyone's food had arrived at the table. Fortunately we had the time but if we hadn't that would have been bad.

The California rolls were rolled well and tasted amazing. The food will surely contribute to my decision to come back. What I did not like: water came out without any ice in it. The server stood in the open and essentially watched us as we ate.

We paid over $60 to eat shredded radish rather have sashimi. Got little over 20pieces of thinnest sashimi at this place. I do not expect  the best sashimi quality in the Midwest but I would rather get frozen tuna from the grocery. As a big fan of rolls and sushi, I would try somewhere else on campus or in downtown.Also they share kitchen with the Asian supermarket next to. Sanitation is awful for both place. Ever since I notice this, I never go back.",

That or somehow they figured out that it was my girlfriend's birthday dinner and delivered her rolls on a bamboo stand with candles stuck in wasabi balls hahaCONS:- Entrees such as the teppanyaki all fail miserably short in flavor, quality, and consistency- If there are more than 3 tables filled, the restaurant gets overwhelmed and you can expect a dramatic fall off in service and increase in wait times for your food- Miso soup is blandI agree with the other reviewer that lamented the fact that the rice was a little sloppy on the rolls and nigiri. I agree that sushi is an art, but when you're in southeastern Illinois in the middle of the cornfields with Korean sushi chefs, sometimes you just have to lower your expectations on good lookin' sushi. If fresh fish and rolls are what you're looking for, look no further than Yellowfin.The restaurant is run by Koreans, and they seem to be understaffed in the front as well as the back. However, service is attentive when it's not too busy, and the servers are college-age and friendly.There is a Korean market right next door and I would highly recommend stopping by to pick up some groceries or just great Asian junk food like Shin Ramen or those delectable Asian funyuns.Come here on a date or with a small group of friends for the good quality and selection of sashimi and rolls; the ambiance at night is intimate when it's not full. They have large bottles of all 3 major Japanese beers (Asahi, Sapporo, Kirin) for your enjoyment as well.",

I always get the vegetarian plate and it comes with California rolls, wasabi, seaweed, and tempura vegetables. They serve soda by the can, which is a drag because I usually like one refill on my pop and I like the taste of fountain drinks better. I also could live without the loud contemporary Christian music which always seems to be playing.  (I have nothing against Christian music but I don't like loud music while I'm eating.) A nice cafe if you're in the mood for it.",

Yellowfin was just about as satisfactory as Sushi Kame in my opinion, and neither of them really blew my mind.Granted I got take out and by the time I arrived home the fish was practically room temperature (it was sitting on the counter when I arrived.) I understand the results of rice in the refrigerator, but  give a shorter pick-up time so that it is not prepared after 10 minutes and then sitting out for 15.Many of the reviews for these places rave about the rolls, and for good reason. A sushi roll does some really great things for masking the quality of the fish you are using. Toss in some mayo, masago, and cucumber and it all tastes the same. My nigiri left sooo sooo much to be desired. The tuna was dark and stringy, the salmon almost flavorless, and the rest of the assortment was dry and average. Secondly, too...much...wasabi. Each piece had a huge amount underneath the fish...my sinuses may never be the same. After a few pieces I began disassembling everything to wipe off some of it in order to actually taste the fish.The one roll that really made me smile was the spicy tuna. Rarely do sushi joints use the right amount of mayonnaise, and this one surprisingly does. It was creamy, but not overly so. I cannot speak for any of the cooked food but I am sure they are fine. My personal mission is finding good fish...and I understand the difficulties of that in central Illinois, but I haven't given up yet!",

The specialty rolls go from $13-$15 for 8 rolls and the rolls are smaller than other sushi places. However, they have a unique \"create your own sushi\" menu item for $9 for 8 rolls. This place would be perfect if the main entrees were $2 cheaper.",

I think with the lack or marketing it was confusing when the new spot opened but it was the express version. This place has a completely different feel from the one downtown which is fine. I like that it's quick and I don't feel weird eating alone between classes because everyone else is doing the same. Sushi was good. Nothing amazing I only got cooked seafood so I can't say on freshness of the fish. However their set up for cooking is going to lose them money. I ordered three BIG roll pieces and I watched him pull them out from under a heat lamp. Obviously they have to make the whole roll and not waste money but I don't want to see that process.  Not the chefs fault just the layout.  Maybe once it's consistently busy that won't happen as much but definitely takes away from the idea of fresh sushi. But I still ate it and it didn't taste dried out so I can't really complain. It's a clear your own plates place or its implied with the dirty bins out next to the trash which I hate but whatever everyone does it. This is a quick place for sushi and I think the pros out weight the cons. If you want a more sit down experience go downtown.",

It doesn't have outdoor seating like the Neil St. location but it's always extremely clean, the staff is very courteous and helpful, and it is just the right temperature for dining (I don't why some restaurants insist on being -4F). The sushi is very Americanized so expect a lot of cream cheese, beef, and other more accepted ingredients. I've had a lot of $1 sushi in the past so I tried the chicken stir fry with udon noodles. It was good, piping hot and came with a good broth. There wasn't any particular seasoning or teriyaki flavoring. The meal was about $10. Overall, a good experience for a quick lunch for less than $10.",

The $0.80/piece Hooked deal was the perfect excuse to get take-out on a weekday!It's really clean on the inside and the dcor was spot on for a quick-service campus place like this.I decided to get one of everything and doubled up on a couple that I thought sounded good to fulfill the 10 piece limit on the Hooked deal. It was hard to tell which one was which on my plate, so I'll just say that I know for sure the Big, Popper, and Coconut stuck out the most to me. I felt the Cali was a bit lacking/plain and in general the rolls labeled \"spicy\" on the menu had little to no kick to them. I couldn't seem to pick up the jalapeno in any of the pieces either, maybe it was accidently omitted?The people behind the counter are more than likely students and were very pleasant.I would say that it does seem to be a little overpriced due to the pieces being considerably smaller than the rolls I'm used to, both in physical size and the amount of fish versus rice.Do not get me wrong though, it is definitely a good option with the Hooked discounts, and would be a relaxing atmosphere to bring a virgin sushi friend to try it for the first time, since they could just order the sample pieces.I will for sure give the house rolls and other entrees a try since Ko Fusion is in a great location.",

It sucks that it is on campus as I hate trying to maneuver in campustown and there is NO parking but it is worth the trek if you are looking for the best sushi in Chambana with a side of Ramen and other adventurous Asian fusion options.  (Oh did I mention that are open til 1am or something crazy like that? Holla!)",

When I came to visit my baby brother in college (where the heck is Urbana-Champaign, anyways??), I thought that I would be eating the run-of-the-mill college food.  Mentally prepared for dry burgers and overcooked pasta, I was nearly weeping with joy when I saw that there was a good sushi place.Sakanaya did not disappoint.  My brother and I had the Playgirl and the normal spicy tuna and salmon avocado rolls.  The Playgirl was DELICIOUS (how do you fit that much crunchy flavor into one bite?).  The spicy tuna also came in chunks rolling in spicy sauce, none of that nasty mayo stuff.  It was so good we practically inhaled it.It is a small restaurant, so if you come during a prime time there will be a short wait.  It was around 20 minutes for us at 6:30 PM on a Sunday, so not enough to deter me next time.Now that we discovered Sakanaya, I may be a leeetttle more inclined to come visit UIUC again.  Mmmmmm.",

If you are looking for a more affordable sushi dinner, this is probably not the place for you. The fish is very fresh and extremely high quality. We ordered an assortment of sushi and I was very satisfied with our meal. 4 stars because if you'd like to eat here, seating is very limited and you will likely be waiting for a very long time (unless you go during university breaks!). Word of note: they *do* offer takeout, and we have definitely taken advantage of that!",

The spicy tuna roll was unlikely other sushi restaurants around. They actually use whole slices of tuna, toss it in the spicy sauce and roll it as opposed to other locations. The decor was great and very upscale. I would definitely recommend the \"It's Seoul good\" roll. I will definitely be back, probably tomorrow!",

Naturally, I hopped on yelp to check out the sushi situation in Chambana and came across this place. So glad I did.Since the students were gone for the holiday I thought we would be okay getting in and we were. There was a 5 minute wait which was a-okay with me. This place is TINY so i can only imagine how packed it gets but the short wait gave us time to check out the fish and it looked beautiful so we knew we were in for a treat.We ended up doing a chef's choice sashimi plate and it was wonderful. The fish was fresh and delicious! Service was friendly and efficient and I love the modern decor. By far the best sushi i've had in the midwest. Nice job Sakanaya! Now can you just expand already so next time I come in town i can come in without a wait ;)",

It's got a very modern and relaxed atmosphere which is perfect for a cozy dinner.I've gone several times, having gotten the hotate and tako nigiri which were both really fresh. I would recommend getting the Una Q and Spider if are still new to sushi, otherwise the standard raw rolls were up to snuff.What I will say about Sakanaya is that for once I had an unagi roll that had an ample amount of eel on it! I haven't gone to a sushi place in champaign that actually gives you that much actual sea food, let alone seafood that's fresh.I recommend getting here early or calling to see availability, because the restaurant can probably only seat 30 guests. Don't be afraid to flag down your waitress too, as they sometime's are a little slow.",

It's great that Sakanaya's business seems to be thriving!By the numbers...40: approximate number of guests the small restaurant seats.10: actual number of minutes I had to wait for my table. 1: check-in on Yelp that'll score you a free bowl of miso soup.14: dollars it'll cost ya for an order of bulgogi, and let me tell you, was I craving bulgogi that week!  Entree also comes with soup, bowl of white rice, salad, 2 little dumplings, and 2 pieces of sushi.  Boom.Nigiri: not a number, but fun to say, and I thoroughly enjoyed my yellowtail and fatty salmon ones ($3-4 apiece).Waitress Sophia was so pleasant!  Glad Yelp tipped me off to yet another fine establishment.  Last note: you won't find street parking on Green St.  Look on the side streets, but make sure you have coins to feed the meters!",

However, I wish they had bigger tables instead of making two people sit at one person table because I personally want all my dishes at once but the table did not have room for the other dishes, so that was I a little disappointment. I ordered I Love Tuna and Salmon Roll. Salmon Roll was amazing and very tasteful! I Love Tuna was okay. The spicy sauce that they added took away the flavor of tuna. I will definitely go back there but I will not order I Love Tuna anymore.",

I had a tempura shrimp roll, and it was 7 pieces deep, all big and overflowing with everything you'd want in a roll. But let's talk about the fact that the ownership actually put some care and attention to the details about the way this place looks. Fact is, humans are very much moved by their environment, and Sakanaya designed this place to be an experience. I will gladly pay the prices on the menu to eat this type of fare in a really beautiful space. All others can hit up Panda Express. Enjoy. Nice work, Sakanaya. Really impressive.

Came here for lunch with 3 friends on Saturday.  Even though it was mom's weekend, the restaurant was only about half full.  I ordered the tonkotsu ramen.  My expectations were definitely low, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The broth was flavorful and the ingredients seemed fresh.  It wasn't perfect, although admittedly this is just nitpicking.  The noodles were slightly overcooked so they didn't have the springy texture that ramen noodles should, and there were some noodles that were clumped together from overcooking.  The meat wasn't as tender as it should be, although it was not tough by any means.  The most disappointing thing was that the egg was a simple hard boiled egg rather than the soy sauce eggs you typically find in ramen.",

What is the point of a SMS-based notification system if you don't use it?

Walk in the door... oops, 40 minutes wait.  Wha-wha-what?!?!?   Disappointed, I decided to order take out.... since this was my first time ordering sushi here, I decided to just go with my standard order of a spicy salmon roll -- I use it to compare to my standard ideal of a good spicy salmon roll.  Hostess was friendly but said it was 10-15 minutes before I get the order.  ?!!?!?!   The sushi chef is already spreading the rice down on the nori?!!  Whatever.... I had my takeout in hand after 3 minutes.  I think this hostess is just over-exaggerating the wait time so that when your name is finally called, you'll be all excited and feel that expectations are exceeded.I must say that the packaging of my take-out was excellent.   It was in a narrow box with chopsticks,soy sauce, and napkin neatly wrapped around it in an elastic.   That's my only positive point of the takeout.The roll looked awful at fist sight.... something didn't look right about the rice.  Not sure what it was.   It sure didn't taste any better.  99% of spicy salmon rolls that I've had are covered in a spicy mayo.   I swear that this was just squirted with a bit of a sweetened schiracha sauce.  And the rice was not cooked properly... it still had a bite to it and was grainy.  It also was not seasoned properly.... I've eaten at some high end sushi joints in New York AND Tokyo, and I've even attempted to make it and I know that there was hardly any rice vinegar in this.... you could taste every single grain of rice.   You know how they say that sushi is supposed to be the perfect balance of rice to fish and when served at the perfect temperature (body temp FYI), it is supposed to create a wonderful sensation in your mind and body.... yah, well, these sushi chefs need to go back to sushi-school or at least a REAL sushi restaurant and wash rice for three years before they even attempt sushi again.    Again, it was expensive for a salmon roll -- $7.   I've had better from a grocery store (I haven't eaten that stuff in about 10 years but still, it was better.).   I still want to try the ramen, but now I'm not so sure... something in the back of my mind is screaming, \"ARE YOU NUTS?!??!!?\"To the salmon that gave its life for this sad excuse of a sushi roll.... I am sorry, but your death was for nothing.",

The presentation and taste were much better than I had expected from a sushi place in the Middle of Nowhere, Illinois, much less, the United States in general.The price vs quality vs portion ratio though, didn't quite match up.

The staff is friendly and caring and the service is perfect.  All of that is great, but what ultimately makes a restaurant special is the food, and our family found the sushi at Sakanaya to be unbelievably fresh, varied and beautifully prepared & presented, and most importantly delicious.  This is just an amazing sushi bar.  We intend to try the Ramen on our next visit.  It looked beautiful when it wafted by.Because Sakanaya has been so wholeheartedly embraced by the U of I student population,  be patient and be prepared for a wait, but the food and the environment make it all totally worthwhile(you can go hang out at a nearby bar or shop and they will call you when your table is ready).  We had a fantastic meal and great time.  If you love great food, then you owe it to yourself to check out Sakanaya.One last note, I concur with Seth's comment re: the early and ignorant review. That was useless and not helpful at all.  Sakanaya is a great restaurant serving great food.    sometimes waiting for a table is worth it and if you consider the quality of the experience and the excellent food, then the value is high and huge.    Great place.  Go now.",

We eat sushi a lot, and wanted to try a new place, especially while the students were out of town.  The atmosphere is great (you feel miles away from campus town on the inside)- very nice decor.  Our server and all the staff were great- they brought us an appetizer on the house which was delicious (they came and explained what to do because we looked a little confused- it was a tower of rice, crab meat (I think), and spicy tuna (I think) with sauces and you mix it together- Mmm!  The sushi was great- very fresh and a lot of variety!  We picked from specialty rolls.  I loved the kamikaze and playgirl, and we had about 3 others too- very filling.My boyfriend had the hot sake and I had the peach sparkling sake, and they were both great.Highly recommend going here!  I'm not sure how busy it is when students are around (parking is a little far away as we parked on fifth street at meters, so may be harder when school is in session), but wonderful addition to campus town and sushi places in town!",

My friends and I all ordered a few different rolls so we could sample them all and I still couldn't pick a favorite because everything was so freakin good.If this place weren't on campus, I would be there often but it just gets a bit busy with students sometimes.

The menu is small, but well chosen. The green tea has a lovely roasty flavor; it was well brewed. I had the spicy shoyu ramen and my friend had the tekka don. She was very happy with the tekka don (eel and veg over rice). I liked the ramen pretty well. It had a spicy broth with just a hint of richness. I'd like more depth in my broth, and more tenderness in the meat in the bowl, but I was pleased that the dish wasn't tame. For a small, campus-town restaurant, this one has a calm, grown-up atmosphere. It's clean and quiet with quality food. The prices are not low, but the value is decent.",

I initially just wanted to get some ramen to go to satisfy my massive ramen craving I had. When I asked for some ramen to go, they informed me that they do do take out but that they can't do ramen to go. I decided to come in later and boy was I happy that I did! I ended up trying the Willis Tower appetizer which is this deconstructed sushi \"tower\" with tuna, roe, coleslaw, avocado, & rice. The fish was amazing and super fresh and I couldn't stop eating it. I also had a mojito which was certainly tasty but a little on the boozy side. I ended up ordering the miso ramen which was also pretty amazing. My only gripe was that I felt like the pork and egg were a little over cooked for my liking. Also, this place is teeny tiny. Total seating comes to about 30 people. So, I would not try to come here on a typical busier night. Calling ahead or having a back up plan might be the way to do it!I can't wait to come back here for some sushi! This might be my new favorite sushi spot in town!",

It's about what you'll pay at any restaurant, except maybe street vendors or whatnot. Anyways, the ramen is decent, not amazing. It's probably the best you'll find on campus. What makes the ramen? The broth. Being the snob I am, I asked for a little bit of each ramen's broth but was told that they make the broth with each bowl of ramen. Hmm. Some flags when up there. Regardless, I tried both the soy based and chicken based broths and found there was really nothing special about either of them. Again, if you're looking for ramen this place is the best bet, but don't expect anything spectacular.The sushi was what I was more impressed with, as every single place on campus was disappointing me (apart from Cheese and Crackers who imports their fish overnight) but the fish was surprisingly fresh and they gave me considerable chunks of fish for my nigiri. Delicious white tuna by the way.I'd definitely go back for the sushi. If they ever change the ramen or I'm super desperate for some at 2:00 AM or something I'll give this place another try.*Also there were little things I really liked about the place like the atmosphere, the little pipettes they use for soy sauce, and especially the fact that they give you an entire jug of water for your table.",

It was the night before finals week started, so we decided to go all out. The 5 Sushi Rolls that we got were California, Playgirl, Windy City, VIP and Gold Rush. I voted the Gold Rush my favorite (also the most expensive), then playgirl, VIP, Cali, and then Windy City. I'm not really a fan of fish, so I was a little worried about that, but all of the ones we ordered had fish, and loved them all. We got  our food very quickly and everything was gorgeous. The atmosphere was very contemporary and felt like I was in an upscale sushi restaurant in the city. It was nice to have something so close to me at school, and so classy. We left feeling full, but not weighed down. Everything was so fresh and beautifully presented. I will be checking out a lot more sushi restaurants from now on. It was a little pricey (we wound up paying around $115 for the table) but we left extremely satisfied.",

                "review": "Sakanaya is a new sushi restaurant that opened up a couple months ago. You'll notice that it looks out of place because the front looks like it's made out of wood. But as you walk in, the decor makes it look like any downtown restaurant. The interior is small but they make use of every bit of space while making it still look open. My girlfriend and I decided to visit it last Saturday.When looking at the menu, you'll notice that it's just 3 pages (another Yelper posted it earlier). You'll see that it has the standard variety of sushi and rolls with a few unique creations. While some may think the limited menu is disappointing, I consider it refreshing. It reminds me of Big Grove Tavern's menu, where it isn't cluttered and highlights tasteful entrees. My only complaint is that most of the entrees are priced above average.The food, now that's the best part. I've had sushi everywhere in Champaign (Yellowfin, Oishi, Sushi Kame, Ko Fusion, etc.). Sakanaya ranks among the best, as one of the places that serves the freshest and tastiest sushi. I also enjoyed the Champaign/Urbana roll. For those who are new to sushi, the C/U roll and salmon and tuna sushi are good ways to get introduced. The service was good as well. Our waiter was very attentive. He even gave me free miso soup because he thought I'd be \"left out\" since my girlfriend was getting soup with her entree. All in all, I'd recommend Sakanaya as an occasional date spot night. It has some of the best sushi in town for a somewhat high price. You can bet I'll be coming back sometime soon.",

The rolls were average, but the nigiri was fantastic! Perhaps some of the best I've had. The fish was huge, and beautifully displayed. It was obviously a quality piece of fish. Oh yeah, and it tasted good too.We had a bit of a wait for our table, which gave me plenty of time to admire the decor and ambiance (both great). The waitstaff was professional and friendly, even when I couldn't make up my mind, or remember what I had already ordered.Overall, this is a classy place with great food. Next time I'll have to try the ramen, and maybe in a while I'll consider this place 5 stars!",

                "review": "Restaurant reviewIt took 4 tries before finally being able to eat here. The yelp reviews looked solid which is why we had high hopes for good sushi in Champaign. We have been let down by yellowfin and oishi was okay, but this took it to the next level in terms of freshness and ambiance. The first and second time we came here at dinner time the line was out the door. If you have a little one this is quite difficult to stand outside in the cold so we gave up. The third time we came it was closed on new years day. Finally while all of the students were away on winter break, we came at 530 and did not have to wait at all. We ordered the Sakanaya Supreme which included 10 pc sushi+ 15 pc sashimi+ spicy tuna+ spider roll for 55 dollars. After tax and tip this is closer to 70 dollars which is note cheap for dinner on campus. What you get is very fresh fish and well prepared sushi. The salmon pieces were a high note, very fatty and served at the right temperature. The actual presentation for the dish fell sort of flat compared to oishi with a piece of lemon and banana leaf splayed across the dish, but who cares I guess when you talk about food quality. The fish was fresh and there was ample enough food for 2 people. The cuts of the sashimi were generous. My highlight was the spider roll with crunchy soft shell crab that was cooked well. Often the oil used to fry the soft shell crab is over used and has a odd taste, but this was cooked right to perfection. Overall this is the top sushi place in Champaign. The only major downside is high price for the campus area and also very limited seating which means you have to get here early or be prepared to waitPros: very fresh fish, best spider roll in champaignCons: limited seating, be prepared to wait if you show up at peak timesHidden deals:They have some lunch specials, but the savings are marginal",

                "review": "Came here for dinner on a Friday evening. It's a little small, so prepare to wait at prime dining hours. We had the sakanaya and kamikaze rolls and fatty salmon to share. The sakanaya roll was particularly good- crab, avocado, and salmon, topped with scallop and fish flakes. Really, really good. One of the better sushi rolls I've had at any sushi place. Both rolls were nicely presented. Fatty salmon is my weakness, and Sakanaya's is very expensive per piece ($9!) but it was pretty worth it tonight. While it wasn't the best piece I've ever had, it was still melt-in-your-mouth delicious. If you ever get the chance, you need to try fatty salmon! For the rest of our meal, we had tonkatsu ramen. I have to say, I wasn't blown away by the ramen. I'd give it three stars. The broth was the right color and consistency, but it really lacked the richness and pork flavor that tonkatsu ramen should have. It just tasted a little thin and bland. Definitely need to work on that. The noodles themselves were nice and chewy, so no complaints about that. Meat was tasty, but cut pretty thin. Thumbs down for the egg, which was hard boiled and cold... Skimpy on the bamboo shoots. I was happy about the noodles, but the rest of the ramen was just okay. Overall, I'd give Sakanaya 3.5 stars. The sushi is great but I think the ramen could be improved a lot. I'd love to explore the rest of the menu some time. I'll definitely be back, at least for sushi!UPDATE: Ramen still needs work. Still lacking richness and flavor that truly good ramen has. Had to add soy sauce to the tonkatsu at my last visit. Otherwise, sushi is still excellent, probably the best on campus!",

The service was a little bit slow, and seating is limited: there was a 20 minute wait or so to get a table, even though it was past 10PM. The sake was cheap and plentiful enough to make the wait less of a big deal. We finished off our meal with the deep-fried chicken wings from their late-night menu. Quite good! To sneak in one final nitpick, though: the place tries very hard to make itself seem like a big-city sushi joint with its ambiance, and by that I mean music was blaring pretty loud through the speakers during our meal, making it hard to carry on quiet conversation.",

We had to wait about 20 minutes for our seats--which was fine. I understand that there aren't many tables inside. But at about 1:51 (I looked down to check my watch), there were several people who came in to put their names down and the host started turning people away because it was \"too close to 2:00\"--which is when their kitchens close and they start preparing for dinner. NOW, from my experience, it is APPALLING for you to turn away customers before the official closing time of 2:00pm. THIS IS JUST BAD SERVICE, and if i was the one that was turned away, I would've raised a bit of a scene. Felt bad for all the couples/groups that got turned away that day. I don't know if this is a regular thing for Sakanaya or if it was a one-time occurrence, but word of advice--don't turn your customers away because it's too close to kitchen turning time. And don't be crying when your customers start going to some of the other competitors in the area because THEY'RE not turning away customers. My sister got the Tonkotsu ramen and I got their 8pc sashimi lunch special. The ramen was subpar--too bland and their broth wasn't the right consistency--that thick, flavorful Tonkotsu ramen consistency. My sashimi was extremely fresh--the one good part about this experience. And the sushi roll was perfectly average--nothing mind-blowing or not extremely bad either. If it wasn't so overpriced, i would say that the sashimi is pretty much the only thing going for this restaurant.Overall restaurant service was pretty bad too. From the hosts to the servers. Our server brought us our check even before we finished our meal and started cleaning our dishes too soon. It was obvious they were trying to rush us out of there. All-in-all, Sakanaya had average food for being slightly overpriced--but even the fresh sashimi can be overlooked because of their service. TERRIBLE.",

By the time we were seated, there were already people waiting to get in.  Seems like people were as excited by Sakanaya as we were.  Aside from the pop-up ramen nights that happen from time to time, there hasn't been a place in town to get real ramen.  I'm sad to say that I'm still waiting for a good ramen place.The ambiance in Sakanaya is really really impressive, especially remembering what Sushi Avenue (the restaurant formerly in this location) used to look like.  Very nice date-night atmosphere with low lights and a beautiful interior.  However, that kind of thing factors in pretty low on my set of priorities.  My husband and I both ordered a bowl of ramen.  They're pretty huge, easily a meal by itself or more than that if you haven't got a big appetite.  However, at $12-$13 it was overpriced.  The noodles were sticking to each other (like they'd been sitting around for a while cooling), and the broth had no depth of flavor.  At first bite the broth's flavor was quite good, but as I got closer to the end of the bowl I realized how completely unremarkable it was.  The pork slices were good, but not great, and the hardboiled egg was nothing special, either.  Additionally, I found the inclusion of corn baffling and off-putting.  I would pay maybe $8 or $9 for this ramen.  At Mitsuwa up near Chicago, $10 buys a pretty remarkable bowl of ramen from the Santouka shop, and that is my frame of reference for this meal.We also got a couple pieces of sushi with our meal which were about on-par with our other favorite places in town, Sushi Kame and Yellowfin.  In short, the sushi is good but a bit more expensive than other places in town, and the ramen would be serviceable if it cost about $4 less.  I think you will like this place if you don't mind paying a bit more for a fancy atmosphere, but I probably won't be back.",

                "review": "What a great addition to the CU sushi dining scene!My boyfriend and I stopped in early last Friday evening. We shared the miso ramen, gyoza, a sakanaya roll and a spicy tuna roll (I can't resist) and everything was excellent. The miso ramen was chock full of delectable and thoughtful ingredients, perfectly cooked noodles and slurpably delicious broth. I would definitely order that again, but not before I try everything else on the menu!  The Sakanaya roll melts in your mouth, and the spicy tuna was great too.The hot sake is an awesome (large) portion for $6. Hits the spot when it's freezing outside.Service was fast and friendly, we never felt rushed. The ambiance is lovely, the space feels like a cozy haven you duck into from the sidewalks of campustown--a welcome retreat. You can tell that everyone involved in this new endeavor is taking pride in what they're doing. The wait is long when students are in town, but totally worth it in my opinion.Nick, the manager brought us some extra treats at the end of the meal and gave us a peek at the late night menu. Looks like I'll be venturing to campus for some chicken wings in the very near future! I've already heard great things.We can't wait to return!",

                "review": "I was in town visiting and my cousin picked out Sakanaya for us. We are definitely a ramen loving family, so it's a must that we get together to enjoy a hot bowl on those cold winter days! We walked in for lunch, party of 10 and we were lucky enough they had tables to put together for us. I was digging the ambiance of the restaurant. It had that new, hip feel to it, while still keeping that Japanese classy feel. It got pretty busy after we had been there for a bit, so I could tell this place was popular in town. Also, I do have to mention their ladies room. It was sooo clean! I love when restaurants take care of their restrooms. To me, that is a sign of a good establishment. Our waitress, her name has slipped my mind (Sophia, maybe?) was a sweet girl. Very polite and attentive. She took care of us very well by answering all of our questions and seeing to it that our needs were met. The lunch menu was a bit lacking. It was very small, and from what the waitress told us, we couldn't really order anything off of the dinner menu. We were strictly stuck to the lunch menu, and that was frustrating. I was craving nigiri and sashimi as well! I ordered a bowl of their Soicy Tonkotsu ramen. and split a roll combo (choice of one regular roll + one yaya roll), but she let us substitute a different roll for the yaya, so we ended up getting a tuna and salmon roll for the combo. RAMEN -  It wasn't spicy enough, so I asked for another side of the spicy paste they used in the bowl itself. That made it the perfect level of spicy! Unfortunately, I can't say anything else about the bowl was perfect.. In all honesty, the broth and noodles tasted like instant ramen. The noodles were extremely soft and soggy. The spicy paste made the broth taste better, but it still lacked that heavy, full of flavor, ramen broth I'm used to back home. Also, there was a BUNCH of white onions AND green onions. If I didn't love onions, I would definitely say it was overkill (which is what another cousin said of their bowl). I'm not used to white onions in my ramen either, so that kind of threw me off, and it wasn't enjoyable. But the biggest problem with the ramen that I had was the egg. The egg is my favorite part of ramen, hands down. This egg tasted exactly like my boiled eggs in my kitchen.. The yolk was dry and broke off in chunks, the egg white was bland. It was just.. depressing. I probably could've made this bowl of ramen in a dorm room. SALMON + TUNA ROLL - The cousin I split the combo with ate the tuna roll since I'm more of a salmon kind of girl, so I don't have any comments on that roll, but the salmon was really good. It was fresh and buttery. Pretty good for a plain salmon roll. All in all, I would have given Sakanaya three stars had it not been for the decor, restroom cleanliness, and service. I would return on my next visit for sushi, but count me out for their ramen.",

Seared scallop with bonito flakes tops the roll and it has salmon, crab meat, and avocado (okay, so a really glorified Cali roll), but it's very tasty and presented gorgeously. It's around $14, so be ready to part with your cash! The treat is definitely worth it though.The ramen is delicious, albeit pricey. Huge portions of everything are in your ramen. My only complaint is that some of my ramen noodles had a strange. mild soapy taste. The pork broth had a strong, savory flavor, and I recommend getting the tonkotsu ramen. The slices of pork and veggies are also generous, which I really liked. It's not the best ramen I've ever had, so I don't think the price is warranted. The interior is very small and a bit cramped when it's full of people coming in and out, so be ready to be bumped a bit or squeeze by people at dinner. However, the staff are polite and do their best to stay organized; they use an iPad system to keep track of orders and tables, and they wait in the back or to the side while on standby to avoid collisions. I think it's considerate because the wait might take a while (even with a reservation), so you can walk around on Green Street and they'll call you when a table opens up.So far it's the only place on campus that has good ramen, so I suppose I could say I'm a fan.",

I was a little hesitant though since there were no elite reviews and some of the reviews seem like fakes, but here's mine. Hopefully you can trust me.I walked in and it looks really nice, nice decorations and everything, just really small. Put our name in and waited probably 20 minutes or so to be seated. People love their sushi on a Saturday night I guess. I recommend calling for a reservation, and don't plan on coming if you have more that 4 people since there's barely enough tables as is. From what I read, the ramen was pretty good. My friend told me that too and the waiter said that's what they were known for so that sounded good to me. The gf and I both got ramen, forgot what their names were though. We did have different broths though and I liked mine better. Hers was the first one listed and mine was the second. I'm definitely a fan of this. I usually don't like ramen since you can pay 10 cents and make it in the microwave as opposed to paying 13 bucks for this one, but this was good. Meat was even tender and the dish as a whole was pretty solid.We also ordered a sakanaya roll which was recommended by our waiter. Guess the sushi was backed up since it took a while for it to get out to us. To be honest I wasn't really a fan. Tasted fine but wasn't anything special. It was room temperature, so it just makes me think that it was sitting out for a while, but hey that may be your cup of tea, who knows. But anyway, 4 stars for the ramen dishes pretty much.",

Or those that are flabbergasted that a new, small restaurant with some buzz about it might not have a table open right when you walk in.  Party of seven on the Saturday evening of opening weekend?  Oh, of course.  Luckily some reviews have started to trickle in from people who have a clue what they're talking about.First trip in we grabbed some gyoza (solid) for the table to get things going, and then a Sakanaya Roll and Emperor's Roll to split, along with some otoro nigiri.  The rolls were great, but this place is packing pretty decent fish, so don't be afraid to go nigiri/sashimi.With all of the ramen talk, that was gonna be our focus.  Miso and tonkotsu were both well-prepared, with more noodles than we expected and good (but maybe sparse) pork.  My only problem was with the preparation of the egg that's included, which is more of a personal taste thing, as it seemed like a tea egg.  Overall very good.  We just got back from NYC and managed to squeeze in both Ippudo and a hole-in-the-wall hand-pulled noodle place in Chinatown, so I can't say it's the BEST ramen I've had recently, but we grade this shit on a curve based on location, right?  Second time around I went with the pork bul-goki.  Nice spice and well-prepared.  Miso soup was good and the salad was really nice.  Good to see a place like this open up and go all-out on ambiance and storefront design on top of menu.  Would like to see some more options available for the ramen, but that might be something that comes after the kinks are worked out.",

I went with two friends, and each of us ordered a regular roll and then split a specialty roll. I wanted to get sake don instead of a roll, but it was just too expensive. Overall, this is a solid little sushi place and I would come here again... if someone else was paying.",

The posh, slate colored trim and the dim oversized lightbulbs gives it an industrial flavor. You see the detail work in the silverware, menu, even the napkins... the ambiance outranks all of the other campus restaurants out there. This meticulous attention is of course given to the food. I'm a bit picky about my sushi and I can say that the sushi here is fantastic. I've had their cold noodles and ramen as well. Like the sushi, they all have a balanced composition of flavor and texture. Its definitely worth going to for a nice dinner out on campus.",

The quality of the food was very good, but I felt like we were paying more for the atmosphere than the food itself (though, to be fair, the atmosphere was quite nice--definitely a good place for a date if you don't mind it being a little bit on the loud side).

The rice, sometimes, is too hard. The fish is also cut irregularly, sometimes they are a good size, other times, it's really tiny. The last time I came here, however, it was really good.

Sometimes there's a long line, I recommend using the \"no wait\" app. Probably the fanciest restaurant on green street, perfect place to bring a date. Signature rolls are about 12-16 dollars. Recommend the \"Willis tower\" as an appetizer. Not really a place to go when you're really hungry cause you'll be spending a lot of money. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 cause of the expensive menu especially for a restaurant on campus. If there was a fire on green street, this restaurant would be the first one to go.",

The udon was definitely spicy (as promised), but not so much that I couldn't enjoy the dish. Overall I was very happy with my meal. The ambiance of the place is very nice, but a little too hip for my taste. Lighting is pretty dim and my friend and I had a little trouble figuring out how the water pitcher worked. In the end, though, I think everything about this place comes together pretty well, and it deserves its spot in Chambana's pantheon of great restaurants.",

The line was so long and you always need to get there 30 minutes before you open to get a seat immediately, otherwise you would need to wait for at least an hour. It was worth the wait because of the atmosphere that's good for dating and seafood was very fresh. However, everything changed. Their seafood is no more fresh, but their prices are way higher than the average. I don't really have a reason going there anymore. Why would you pay more to get something very average?",

With an extensive menu of appetizers, fresh sashimi, sushi rolls, shoyu + miso ramen, and other korean dishes, you will definitely have to take some time to look over the menu. I would have to say that the sushi was the freshest I've ever tasted in Urbana-Champaign. Being from Florida, my standards for sushi are a bit high and have been disappointed over the past 2.5 years I have been living in the CU, but Sakanaya does not disappoint. Location is ideal as it is right on Green Street, the heart of the UofI campus. Parking can be hectic though. ($0.75/hr) Parking is free after 9pm and free on Sundays. There was a line the entire time we were there, but service was fast and friendly, so the line was constantly moving. Also, we went after opening day. The interior and exterior is very appealing, but the inside is a bit smaller than I would have imagined. The tables are pretty close to each other. The man next to our table was sitting alone, listening on our conversation and occasionally talked to us. Prices are a bit more expensive than I thought. Since it is catering to mostly college students, thinking of one's budget, the ramen bowl would've been nice at $8, instead of the $12. Portion size is good - shared a shoyu ramen bowl and kamakazi (sushi roll) with a friend and we were satisfied. (But there was still room left for dessert.) Ramen broths are pork-based. The pork melts in your mouth and the broth isn't too salty or bland - just right. It was a bit lukewarm though, but that's just preference. I like my soups really hot. The salmon on the kamakazi was really soft and melted in your mouth too. Definitely fresh. Tl;dr? - Sushi and ramen are good. Get it. - Atmosphere is romantic. Definitely a date night kind-of place. - Worth the experience/trip, not worth the price. Would've been better if it was $4 cheaper. Where else can you buy authentic Japanese ramen here, anyway?",

The Bulgoki was visually pleasing. I had never gotten Bulgoki with a side salad, two sushi pieces, and two pieces of crispy tofu. I felt like it was worth the price for what I got. I've spent about $12 for Bulgogi at other restaurants, but it was only the meat and rice. So Sakanaya gave a nice addition. I also thought it was a good way to still put a little Japanese influence in the dish. For the Miso Ramen, it was tasty. It was a big bowl of Ramen definitely not something you can find elsewhere on Green St. The pork was very tender and the broth just made it taste better.Overall, it was a good food night. I definitely recommend Sakanaya if you want a nice place to go for dinner. The food's taste matches the decor: awesome.",

The soup was simple and good, but still nice because we got it for free by checking in on Yelp! The wine was fantastic, I've never had anything like it and it had a sweet flavor to it that separated it from western wine I'm used to drinking.I absolutely had to get sushi and my roommate was pretty set on ramen, so we ordered a Sakanaya roll and the shimp tempura ramen. My roll was superb! I believe it was salmon, crab salad, avocado, scallion and fish flake. Good feedback from his ramen too, which was a huge portion!Overall I thought the food was good but perhaps a little pricey. The atmosphere was unique but a little cramped for our (really) little table of 2.Authentic food in a cool atmosphere on campus, which is kind of hard to find but it comes at a price.Strong 4/5.",

I've been here several times while I was out here in Champaign and none disappointed. The ramen is good, sushi is much better than any others in Champaign, and appetizers are delicious! This place will definitely be successful. It's on the higher end in terms of pricing compared to everything else on the street, but you need to treat yourself every now and then. It's on the further end of Green St, but worth the trek.Be sure to try their sushi and ramen out! Their specials have always been delicious!",

And boy did we find one.The Good:-The Sakanaya roll was salmon, crab salad, avocado on the inside and it was topped with torched scallops and fish flakes. It was extremely good, the fish flakes brought an interesting twist to it, great texture,-Blue-fin tuna sashimi. Our waiter recommended the current special, which was priced at 2.5 per piece. Neither my SO or I particularly like sashimi, but we both loved it, it was fantastic.-The miso soup was just the right amount  saltiness and fantastic flavor.-We also got the Una-Q roll and the Salmon roll, and both were well really well wrapped and delicious. The eel in the Una-Q roll melts in your mouth.-The ambiance! It's exactly what we were looking for, upscale but still casual. Fantastic.-The service is also fantastic! Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable. The Bad:NOTHING!Overall:Absolutely fantastic. We will be back again soon, I guarantee it.",

And it opens till late night, in school time usually till 1am, which is great because I can then have some late night food with friends. However, to eat here you usually have to wait for a long time for the  queue, like 20-30 minutes. Also, the food are kind of pricy, it can easily go up to 30 dollars if you order two food items. But the price comes with the quality!",

The servers are friendly and attentive. The $1 sushi deals on Sundays and Mondays are worth it. My favorite is definitely the big roll; I believe it has egg, crabmeat, avocado and some other stuff, then tempura fried with some sort of sauce on top. The best deal...and I'm kinda mad that I found out right before I graduated...is the lunch buffet! It's sucha great deal. Only weekdays though. The buffet is only around $10 and includes various entrees, such as curry chicken, fried fish croquettes, kimchi, soup, fried rice, noodles and three different types of sushi. The big roll is usually one of the three. Definitely keeps you full without breaking your wallet. :)",

I've only eaten it on dollar sushi nights, which, now that I think about it, is a spectacular bargain.For a Champaign restaurant, Kofusion has a very modern look; frosted glass, colored lights, and random decorations add to the very un-Champaign look and feel, which is refreshing at times.I've also been told that they hold salsa nights here, though I haven't experienced it. Overall, great place on those dollar sushi nights. Can't say much for the rest.",

The last time in town I went and sat at the bar yet time passed and nobody was there. I flagged down the host to see if they even had a bartender on staff and they grabbed one girl who got me started, some other guy showed up and said he entered my food, then some other guy finished as I was looking around for \"bartender: #2\" to get my check.

Also, on Sunday and Monday, they offer 10 different rolls for $1 each.  It's absolutely glorious.The atmosphere is also one of the best in Champaign-Urbana.  With sushi this good, I would be satisfied with a hole-in-the-wall location.  However, KoFusion is classy!  There are tanks of fish, complicated ambient lighting, waterfalls, and many other clever design elements. HIGHLY recommend.",

I ordered the chirashi (my go to dish at sushi places when I am not sharing) And while the portion was decent,  the tuna and octopus both tasted slightly off, like it was old. The other fish on the plate,  while fresh, just didn't have a lot of flavor. In short you pay a lot for pretty average fish, almost 1.5-2x what I would pay for the quality I recieved(depending on the dish)  there are many better places in the area, that have tastier fish and are a bit more reasonably priced.",

Which would have been okay had the fried tempura outside not tasted like bad oil that need to be changed. The Coconut & Mango Roll was very interesting and I really enjoyed it. It contained coconut shrimp which was a unique sushi ingredient to me. I would go back again for that roll and soup and call it it a day. My lunch companions buffet comments: The Salmon Miso soup would have been worth the price of the buffet alone! Sweet potato noodles, and the chicken curry were excellent. He thought the quality of all the dishes was great for a buffet and while the selection was smaller it was worth it based on how well each dish was prepared. In addition the service was very good, friendly and attentive.",

Dollar sushi is a special discount night, and as such will be a different dining experience then typical dining hours.  Its not an \"off\" night its just a different dining experience than a Saturday, and yes I'm sure the servers are more frazzled on these busier nights.  Also, people who rate on just the sushi alone need to realize that this is only a portion of the menu.  I love the sushi here, but I also love the creations of chef Nigel.  I have been here dozens of times in my undergrad years and it was always memorable.  The owner might have high standards in her servers, but that's because she expects high standards in everything in her restaurants.  The bathrooms are immaculate!  The food is incredible!  The drinks are amazing and inventive!  Really, this place has such a warm spot in my heart.  For the middle of Illinois, it doesn't get more creative and amazing than this.  Love Ko Fusion!",

My friend invited me today to meet her for sushi at K.O. and I was looking forward to it. We got there at 11:15, and the server was really nice and very attentive. That's about all I can give this place. I ordered a chicken Bento box that was $15 - I cringed when I saw the price, but the server reassured me that it was \"a LOT\" of food. The box came, and it had chicken stir fry that was pretty plain. Then it had 4 little pieces of California roll that were OK. There was a lump of rice that was undercooked. There were a few pieces of lettuce with an overpowering ginger sauce on it. I'm a very hungry person and I'm the least picky eater I know, and I didn't finish the Bento box. It's not because I wasn't hungry - it's because I couldn't. But what's more, there was certainly NOT $15 worth of food on that plate -- it wasn't \"a LOT\" of food. I ordered veggie dumplings for my daughter, who seemed to liked them. I thought they were pretty good, but they were lukewarm (the server made a big deal about how hot they were - and they were definitely not). The bill came and it was almost $25. For $25, I better have eaten the very best lunch of my life!! And I would've been more satisfied with a $5 footlong, sadly. This place is ridiculous. They have some nerve to charge so much money for food that's not even up to par with cheap fast food. The other restaurants downtown, for the most part, are pretty good. They're still overrated, but better than K.O.! I won't be back.",

However, don't be fooled by the $1... after a couple glasses of wine/beer and an edamame appetizer with your dollar sushi you can still expect your bill to be at least $25-30 per person- but it's worth it! The only catch with dollar sushi nights is that the service is usually very slow.The lunch buffet was really disappointing and in my opinion overpriced. We arrived at noon and much of the food on the buffet seemed as if it had been sitting in the warmer- tough/dry chicken, over cooked edamame, warm sushi.... Skip it and order from the menu.",

Sushi was very below average and I found the selection of nigiri sparse. I don't think it would have been as upsetting if it wasn't so expensive, but even if were priced less, I still cannot say that it was delicious. My bf and I had one drink, one $15-16 maki roll (only five pieces on the plate though), nigiri (2 pieces at 2 bucks a piece), and sushi plate B (which had very few actual sushi for the price) and it was around $70 something. I could not believe it because that was my grocery bill for the whole week and I got a measly meal. We both left still feeling empty in the stomach. I'm not a super chef, but I know how to cook and even to make sushi myself. The rice used was not right. Sushi rice is not the rice you just scoop out of your pot or rice cooker rolled into shapes. There is a preparation process for the rice which adds rice wine vinegar, sweetness, and brings out a slight chewiness that complements the raw fishes and whatnots. KoFusion didn't even do this.The fish was not very flavorful either. The amount of rice used for the nigiri was about 2/3 the proper amount. Rolls were shot with a shrink ray. Everything was just off. The decor was really, I dunno ... just very odd. It's the like uncool kid trying to be really cool. There was neon, walls with bubbles, odd colors, tiles, weird blue lighting, odd shapes. I dunno, maybe this is what is \"trendy\" back then or something but it looks really odd to me. The waiters were fine. i was surprised to hear that our waiter has worked there for over two years. She knew what she was doing. I'm not looking for heaping portions, exquisite tastes at dirt cheap prices. I just want a good portioned meal, tastes good to the average person, and at a reasonable price. KoFusion missed the mark on all of them. Maybe it was just that night or because of new management. I remember KoFusion actually used to be good several years ago.  I was shocked to see how different the quality of food that is being served now. Small portion, wallet shrinking, bland and poorly made sushi. Oh and odd decor.",

Against that backdrop, it really is filling a unique niche. East Coast + West Coast elitist diners will likely be unimpressed (if you're ensnared here for years due to work or school, the nostalgia/desperation for big city experiences might change your mind).Arguably, if you're eating at an Asian fusion restaurant, you should have no expectations of \"authenticity\" in regards to the food. The drink selection features fruity cocktails with sexy, \"exotic\" names and $9+ price tags. Many items on the menu are outright American cuisine lacking even a hint of \"fusing\" with Asian elements. In that respect, this place is ideal for groups made up of both adventurous diners and those who fear \"fish breath.\"The biggest draw for Kofusion are the Sunday and Monday $1 sushi specials. Folks with raw food aversions need not worry. All of the $1 sushi options are variations of deep-fried meats, cream cheese filling, and mayonnaise/sugary sauces. There's such a demand on these nights that the preparation definitely cuts corners--but if you're filling up on these bite-sized heart-attacks, you're likely channeling your inner fat kid and won't mind the rushed presentation.For people who love Japanese cuisine for its delicate, clean flavors, the sushi bar also serves more \"traditional\" fare, though I've sometimes received pieces of sashimi sliced rather clumsily.My advice: the $1 price tag for the Sunday/Monday specials requires such little investment that it's worth a shot for new diners. It might even be the best opportunity for initiating people who are normally turned off by the idea of sushi.",

The sushi rice was hard, cold and tasteless, the toppings,so-so. If you want mediocre sushi in a trendy setting with a bunch of good looking people, this is the place. Otherwise go down the street to Sushi Kame, where they take the time and care to prepare sushi the right way without having to fork out an arm and a leg.",

                "review": "I often get dragged here every few weeks with coworkers since it is close to my work.  I have not been impressed one time.  I got to admit the inside is uniquely decorated, but I dislike almost everything else about this restaurant.  To start, the waiters are really rude and arrogant.  They all seem to have this pompous flair to them and I don't know why.  It most certainly does not make a good server.  They seem to act disgusted almost every time you ask them for something, and are neglectful of your table way more often that not.  It's not surprising for them to forget your table completely... The owner is also very arrogant, and acts sickeningly (and fake-ly) nice as she wanders aimlessly around the restaurant.  The food is alright, but most is very underwhelming to me.  The food is not very authentic, (aside from the sushi) and is more of an Americanized Asian restaurant (much like P.F. Changs), and I tend to hate those types of restaurants.  When I want Asian food, I want REAL Asian food.  Not crappy American creations labeled as Chinese food.  It's pretty expensive too.  Way overpriced in my opinion.  There is a $10 lunch buffet, but there are often only 4 entrees to choose from, and not much else in the ways of other food.  Fried and white rice?  Usually two plates of generic (and really cheap) sushi?  Totally not worth $10 at all.  Order from the menu for lunch and you are looking at paying over $10.  Dinner is even worse.  While I only went once for dinner, and usually end up here for the lunch buffet, the time I did go for dinner was terrible.  The menu is almost set up like a gourmet restaurant, as there's not a big selection at all, and most meals cost around $20.  O_O  The worst part is, the entrees come out on huge plates with the tiniest bit of food in the middle.  They call it New Age Dining but I call it \"I just got seriously ripped off\"I ordered the salmon dish.  It was $21 I think.  Ridiculous, I know.  Well, it came out raw in the middle.  I sent it back, 10 minutes later it comes back, and still raw.  I had to send it back twice and even after the third time it came back it did not taste right to me.  And like I said, it was the tiniest portion ever.  It was maybe a 6oz salmon filet on a plate garnished with sauce next to like a 1/4 cup of rice.... it really is pitiful.  My friend's entrees were similarly scarce looking.  I really don't know how this place gets so packed when it is so expensive and the food is not that good.  It's touted as a huge date spot as well, but I'm surprised most stomach up the huge entry cost.  I hear the sushi is great but I never had anything other than the stuff they put out on the lunch buffet and it was terrible.  It seems expensive too like everything else.  Some praise the $1 sushi night, but that's per piece and personally to me that seems like a high price as well....  I would stay away if I were you, I often even find myself backing out of lunch with my coworkers simply because I can not stand this restaurant any more.",

He said Kofusion, so I looked it up Yelp.In spite of the assorted poor reviews, I went to Kofusion for dinner anyway, since it was Monday and I read (here) that it's Dollar Sushi on Monday.  It took a few minutes even to get to the hostess, who said there was a long wait (the place was packed), but I could sit at the bar immediately.  She responded in the affirmative when I asked if I could order from the same menu.So sit at the bar I did.  For the uninitiated, the 'dollar sushi' is per PIECE, not per ROLL.  So, calculate accordingly.  However, these are not your regular old California rolls, or good ole spicy tuna, salmon skin roll, etc.  These are fancier and more intricate rolls, and priced rather low.  Take a look:  http://www.kofusion.com/?page_id=255I didn't have any idea which would be the best, so I got the sampler (10 pieces, $10).  Actually I got 2 orders :-)It's a little hard figuring out which piece was which sometimes, but the bartender offered to help me several times, and they left the menu with me, which I thought was a nice touch, so I could cross-reference what I was eating. The sushi was totally worth it.    Reading the other reviews, the only thing I can surmise is that the bad reviews came from people who had to wait too long, or maybe the staff has been changed recently.  I had no problem with anyone there; the hostess, the two bartenders who served me, and a woman, who may have been the owner(?) who came and very nicely asked me to move one barstool over so she could seat a party of two next to eachother.Parking is a problem here as with anywhere near the university.  There was a sign on the door saying they validate 2 hour parking for a parking lot, but since I didn't know that, didn't know where the lot was, and had already fed the meter on the street, I didn't think anything of it.The decor was nice, especially against the backdrop of the other restaurants I had been in since driving around eastern Illinois and western Indiana for the past few days.Go to Kofusion and get sushi-  you won't regret it.",

The place has a nice atmosphere and is certainly more thought out than your typical CU restaurant. Is it trying too hard? Maybe, but let's be honest any attempt at trying could be perceived as \"trying to hard\" here because most places don't make any effort at all.So... shame about the food. I've only tried to eat from their non-sushi menu twice and have been disappointed each time. They're main dishes are over-priced and lack flavor. I will say their seafood had a nice, fresh taste but they don't really do anything with it. I'd recommend getting some friends, ordering a couple baskets of edamame, some drinks and many different kinds of sushi. My favorite is definitely the Lava Roll.",

The room was dark and with an impressive modern feel. The music was not too loud and they had a tv screen with changing background art (like you would see on iTunes but a little better). The other tv had the Bulls game so my eyes often wandered away from my date and to this tv (sorry, sweetie). The server was prompt and provided the specials. I decided to go with the Tuna rolls (the standard which I compare these kinds of restaurants) and the chicken stir-fry. The tuna rolls had the largest diameter of meat that I have seen in C-U and it was of a good quality. My only complaint was the meagerness of the serving but they made up for it with a lot of meat for each roll and the neat stacked arrangement of the rolls. The stir fry I really enjoyed! All of their meat dishes seemed to accommodate those who want free-range and humanely treated livestock. For the price and the hype, I was somewhat satisfied. I still think Sushi Kame is the better place to go for Japanese food and sushi and it is not as crowded and loud. However, if you really want to impress out-of-town guests, you go to Kofusion and not Kame.",

I also enjoy the wagyu beef and BBQ pork roll, which are sort of a nice change up. People also seem to enjoy the big roll, though I take a pass because I'm not a fan of mushrooms.OK, so that necessarily doesn't earn the 4 star rating. It's good, relatively inexpensive (unless you're trying to eat 392 pieces) and the location is good. What gets the extra star is that the service is always on point and great. Knowing that people cherry picking what types of sushi they want can cause an error prone environment, the servers (and I suppose cooks/sushi-makers) usually get it right. When they don't, it's fixed quickly.Awesome!",

If not the best sushi I have had, but given that is Uchi in Houston or Austin so that is not completely fair, it is still serviceable.  The atmosphere is great and modern looking without being stuffy or overly chic for no reason.  The patio area is one of the best downtown.The spot is always packed, even on a Monday during the summer when all the U of I students are gone.  So service is a little swamped, but they will check on you when they get a chance and kitchen times are usually spot on.A handful of micros on tap.  Various offerings from Oskar Blues, Dogfish Head, and Bells.  Sushi can be anywhere from very good to meh.  There has been enough inconsistency for me to not give this a full four star.  Sometimes they just over do it, and other times it might not be the freshest.  My latest visit on Monday I had the Unagi roll, which is fresh water eel.  Very good, if not exceptional.  This was done in a very tasteful way and not over done, like some other rolls can be.  They just always fall short of exceptional to me.  Even so, that won't stop me from making other visits in the future.  They are a downtown staple, and try hard.  Certainly a good spot that sometimes falls a little short.",

Dollar sushi nights used to feature around 10 rolls at discounted prices, each week a few of the rolls on the dollar menu would differ from the ones offered the week before.  The service was HORRIBLE, but the sushi made up for it and at $1 a piece you are paying around 70% of normal price (and since they are so overpriced at Ko to begin with this meant you were paying what you would pay anywhere else).Lately I've stopped going to Ko for several reasons.  The dollar sushi menu no longer changes.  It is nearly CONSTANT from week to week.  Sure it's a super discount so you can't complain too much.  However, sometimes some of the sushi you order comes to the table reeking of fish.  The pieces are $1 because clearly the fish is old.  And finally the service is utterly horrible on Sunday/Monday nights.  Sure they are busy, but the wait staff simply suck.To sum it up you can get sushi that is just as good and just as cheap at several other places in Champaign/Urbana.  Branch out a bit, trendy neon lights that change color don't mean the food is good.",

They were going to sit us at a table but my brother requested a booth instead and they were happy to oblige our request.  At recommendation of our waiter me and my brother both got their sangria.  Sangria was strong and very good.  We ordered their seafood/cheese rolls as an appetizer.  The rolls were perfectly crispy, with a nice amount of filling, with a nice sweet sauce to dip it in.  We ordered several rolls (the flaming phoenix, firecracker, fusion, and the Philadelphia roll).  I gotta give top marks to the originality and presentation of the flame phoenix.  The sushi was acceptable but is not going to blow anyone away whose had good sushi.  The rice was a little too chewy and the firecracker was very flimsy with its thinly sliced pieces of jalapeo.  I liked Kofusion and would definitely go back.  But its very expensive and the sushi is only ok.  When we decided we needed another roll we had to ask another waiter to track down our waitress (who had gotten busy with her other tables). Other than that minor flaw, I thought the service was very good.",

The soothing neon lights, aquariums, and smooth lines of the sushi bar are pretty marvelous on the eyes.

                "review": "I came here today with my mom for a late lunch. It's been several years since I've been here. I enjoyed it last time but I remember it being pretty expensive so I've been visiting cheaper sushi places in the interim. KoFusion today left me pretty disappointed. First of all, our waitress gave a really strong impatient vibe. I got the impression that she was staying late or covering for someone else because there were additional customers she wasn't expecting late in the day. She was pretty slow with refilling my water and was trying to take our menus away right as we ordered a roll of sushi for an appetizer. It was like she was trying to discourage us from ordering more. At the time, my mom knew what she wanted but I wasn't ready yet so, I decided to wait until later. When she came back to check, I asked about the sushi bowl. I've never heard of a sushi bowl before and wanted to make sure I wasn't ordering anything I wouldn't like so I asked the waitress to describe it. Seems like a simple request right? Her response was \"the description in the menu is pretty obvious\". Come on, don't you think I read the description first? Even if I hadn't, isn't it her job to talk about the dishes in the menu from her perspective in more detail than what's on the menu? I was very disappointed with her response. After continuing to talk about what sushi bowls could be from what I read, she did reaffirm my assumptions but it would have been nice to have gotten there without the sarcasm. Also, she completely forgot to take my mom's order. If my mom didn't shout what she wanted as our waitress walked away, we would have had to wait until she returned again later. In the end, the food was delicious. I love the sweet and spicy sauce that the sushi bowl came with and if you like raw fish but want something a little different than regular sushi or when others aren't into sushi and you want something for yourself, I would definitely recommend it. For almost $20, I was a little disappointed to see imitation crab but overall it was a good balance of savory, tart, sweet, and spicy.With so many other cheaper and friendlier sushi options, I can't imagine that KoFusion will be lasting much longer when these kinds of experiences are what they're offering. Also, I'm pretty sure we walked in right as dollar sushi was starting which I didn't remember until we were on our way out. Why didn't anyone mention the deal? It's almost like they're discouraging you from spending money there!",

Then it's almost acceptable for the quality of the sushi you get.Everything else is pretty mediocre, yet they're charging for a higher end restaurant price. You're paying for atmosphere and that's about it. Yet, this is the best sushi place located in the CU area in terms of quality. So if you're desperate for sushi and have loads of money, give this place a try.",

Our server was probably the most attentive I've had so far in C-U, but I don't know if that was because it wasn't very busy (the undergrads haven't gotten back to campus yet) or because I was with 5 very attractive female grad students. In any case, drinks were always kept filled and the sushi came very promptly. There are drink specials also on Monday nights: $3.50 bottles of sake and $4 glasses of wine, about 4 each to choose from. We had the hot sake and I had a glass of the Riesling, which was nicely balanced (not too sweet.. very nice for sushi). There were ten rolls available for $1, and we were not required to order all ten of them. I tried one of each except for the organic beef and the alfredo roll. My favorites were the big roll and the crunch roll, which was topped with a nice spicy sauce. The rolls were not very large for being \"special\" rolls, and I definitely would not order one from the regular menu (some were listed as high as $23 for one roll?). It was really fun to go and pick and choose and compare with my friends though. I will be back for $1 night! With wine, sushi, and tip, I spent $23 and was stuffed!",

The first time I went there my friends dragged for \"dollar sushi\" night. I thought I was getting robbed more than saving money, the pieces they give you are very small. The only reason why is its a dollar is because you have to eat like 10 pieces to fill up. The second time I went in there, we ordered a few rolls, and they took quite a while, when I looked over at the customers next to us, it looked like what we ordered, turned out it was. The girls were like, \"this is not what we ordered and had sat on there table for 5 mins before the waitress came and brought it to our table,at that point we just ate and left, she didnt even get a tip. The 2 other times were just as bad, I'll save you time and money, and tell you to try the other sushi places in town.",

The waitstaff was a little harried but it was extremely busy, but they really tried very hard to be attentive. Brian, our server was racing back and forth and came by often to check but when I did need something it was a little hard to get him. He did get back with me as soon as he could with any request I had and was quick with the refills of their Jasmine/Green tea.I got a couple pieces of their $ sushi. The waygu beef was really good, and it was cooked all right-not over done-the right shade of pink. The dynamite roll was also really tasty-really savory and I was surprised that they didn't skimp on the fish.I also got the Hwe Dop Bop which our server didn't know what it was until I pointed it out on the menu. Hwe Dop Bop, by the way is like bibimbap but with sashimi, like the Korean version of chirashi. It didn't come with the 'spicy, red sauce' that it was supposed to come with and I brought this up and he said it already comes with but he could bring me more-that was a little weird that he didn't even look at my dish. However, he did bring me more without asking when I used up what he gave me. Not a bad place, I would probably show up here again if I'm in the CU area, but probably not for $1 sushi-too busy.",

The house rolls are more of Ko Fusion's specialty rolls; they are more expensive, but I think it is worth it. Classic rolls are around $8 and house rolls are around $13-$15. They also have nigiri, but I don't like eating raw fish, so I haven't tried theirs. Hands down my favorite roll is the flaming phoenix. It is a masterpiece from start to finish. It come out flaming (just like the name says) and has many different elements of flavor to it. The $1 sushi is Sunday and Monday. I would suggest trying the sampler if you are not familiar with their different kinds of rolls. After coming here many times, I know which ones I do and don't like. Just read the descriptions and you will be fine picking your sushi. GO TO THE LUNCH BUFFET. They only serve 2-3 types of sushi, but you can stock up that day and get your fill. They also have doughnuts, spicy chicken, edamame , rice, and salad. The outdoor seating is relaxing and has a good vibe. Just like any other restaurant, it is not preferable to sit outside when it is hot and humid. The space inside is cool and dark. It can get loud sometimes because the tables are close together. I also enjoy their different types of tea. They switch out their tea selections frequently. It comes in a smaller sized pot, but the leaves are good for about 2-3 steepings. Overall, I think Kofusion is a good spot for some solid sushi. It's great for birthdays and small gatherings. You can go as casual or dressy as you would like because it's a versatile restaurant.",

If my friend and her boys weren't already there, I would have turned around and left. I got a really bad first impression. It was busy (but nobody else was at the hostess station) and the hostess asked me if she could help me. I said that I was looking for my friend and her two young sons. She got really snotty, rolled her eyes and said, \"Well, you're just going to have to look for them yourself.\" Maybe she was just having a bad day. Who knows. I walked around and still didn't see them when another hostess came up and asked if SHE could help me. I told her who I was looking for and she goes, \"Oh! I know right where they are, come with me.\" She was cheerful and really helpful. It made up for the other super, rude hostess. We had the best waiter I have ever had in this town. No kidding. I saved my receipt so I could remember his name. It was Luke H. He was super attentive, extremely polite, friendly, and really sweet to my friend's kids. Our drinks never went empty and he checked in on us plenty without being annoying or hovering. Being dollar sushi night, I expected a longer wait for our food but our rolls were out quickly. They were all really good, too. The edamame and dumplings were great, also. Super big thanks to Luke H. and the NICE hostess. Hope the other one's attitude improves.",

The first thing you notice is the dcor:  indoor seating is cozy, with an outdoor patio section, ambient lighting and nice candles on the tables (a small detail, but something I love :)    My friend had sushi rolls while I had select pieces of nigiri (salmon, smoked salmon, tuna, shrimp, and tuna caviar).  Now this review may be biased due to the weeks of sushi-deprivation I had experienced prior to coming in...but the food was delicious!  The pieces were well-cut, artfully arranged, and you could tell the fish was good quality.  The best part of the night (aside from the great company) was the service.  The waiter was very friendly, entertaining, and came by many times to checkup on us.  The service really took the whole dining experience up a notch.    P.S.  The mojitos were great too!  Will definitely be coming back for more sushi and drinks nights.",

The big roll (their special house roll) is amazing and huge. I've had many other unique and interesting sushis here as well. Edamame is also quite tasty. And the peach tea is some of the best tea I've ever had. The decor is pretty stylin and if you come at the right time, you don't have to wait very long, if at all, to get a table. Never had an entree here, only sushi.",

The main reason is that they seem really good at sourcing the best ingredients. Everything on the menu seems to have a pedigree: Immerwald Farms Pork, wild line-caught fish, and Wagyu beef are typical menu items.Dinner can get quite pricey, but the service is good and the food is delicious. I can't say it's as creative as other establishments in town, but it's done well. I also love that they have meats like wild boar on the menu. The exception is Sunday and Monday, which is $1 sushi night. The sushi isn't the greatest, but it's decent enough and I'll merrily eat it despite the fact that you aren't supposed to eat seafood on those days because they are probably leftovers. Oh well. Lunch is far more affordable, especially on Mondays when they have $1 Sushi. I think the Bento Box, which has quite a lot of food, is a good deal. Recently it's had salmon cake, California rolls, Wagyu beef/organic chicken, rice, vegetables, and a salad, but the contents vary. I think I could make two meals out of it and they do allow takeout, but usually I devour it pretty quickly because it's so good.Many people think the interior here is suave, but if you look at it long enough it just looks tacky.",

The quality of the food is high and Ko-Fusion does a good job of simulating your typical big city Asian-Fusion, neon lights, lounge music type place. The dollar sushi is a great deal and the rotating options are tasty though sort of cheapish in that they feature a lot of imitation crab based rolls. However for a buck a piece, it's a fair enough trade-off. On my last visit, my gf and I each ordered tea and the server forget which pot was which. To check she practically shoved her nose in one pot to take a whiff and figure it out. Ko-Fusion is good but not great.",

I'd been here a long time ago (like a year and a half ago) right after the place opened, and it was kind of dead and empty. But I went again a couple of nights ago, and the place was fairly crowded and happening. I was by myself so I sat at the bar, where the bartender took very good care of me.First a few words about the place: it's fairly large, with two different seating areas separated by the bar area, and they obviously spent the bucks on the decor. It's fairly modern, with a black and dark blue color scheme, a (fairly) beautiful bar, etc... You somehow can't help thinking that maybe they tried a little too hard to look sophisticated, but nonetheless it makes for a fairly good ambiance.The food is a mix of Asian (mostly Japanese) and new American. I'm usually weary of fusion... but it wasn't bad at all. The first time I was here, I ordered the chirashi, which wasn't the best I've had in my life but was surprisingly decent considering the location (as far from any ocean as you can be in the country...). This time, I started with a seaweed salad (tasty), followed by the whole trout, which came with sauteed mushrooms and spinach... The trout was pretty good, and the veggies delicious. I finished with the black sesame ice-cream: for $4, I expected a tiny little scoop, but I was served a heaping bowl of ice-cream with a strawberry and a wafer... just great.Not to forget their drinks: they have a pretty large selection of wine and sake, as well as a full bar. I had one of their specialty cocktails (the ko-tini: sake, absolut, and peach schnapps in a martini glass... pretty good), and another mixed drink. I was especially shocked to see how inexpensive they were, being used to NY prices.Based on the food only, I would have given this place 3-1/2 to 4 stars, but the service was top notch. The bartender was extremely friendly and efficient, and treated me very well... I'll probably be back.",

Honestly, they'd probably get knocked down a star if it weren't for that one delightfully spicy roll. I've not been for dollar sushi days on Monday, but it sounds like a great way to try new rolls. Their lunch buffet is pretty good. They have a limited amount of sushi and what they do have is pretty safe: california rolls/fried rolls. They also have curry and salad on the buffet. It's a little pricier at over $10/person, but the food is good. Definitely worth a shot if you're interested in checking out some safer food options. For me, I want all things spicy!

The deserts are really really good too. Go for the creme brulee or the fried cheesecake. This is definitely a place to go to on a date or when you're in the mood to go out with friends at night.

Firstly, people should recognize the restaurant for what it is: Korean fushion food. Thus, there's a wide variety of sushi, my personal favorite: hwe dup bap (like sashimi salad) and a smaller selection of hot (but still great--scallops anyone?) entrees that I usually have no interest in because I love sushi that much. If you need a quick sushi fix, dollar sushi Sundays (1 roll = $1) will definitely satisfy your cravings. There are 10 rolls that are offered at that price and they are definitely more of an American style sushi roll (read: little to no raw fish). At first I was really disappointed by this, but I honestly felt like the other rolls were good enough (Big Roll! Coconut Roll!) that I didn't mind at all and eat about $15-$20 worth of sushi anyway. Yes, I am a sushi whore. If you really want good sushi (with more raw fish or more interesting combinations), Kofusion is still the place to go. Their sushi menu is surprisingly extensive with your typical simple salmon rolls to rainbow-type rolls and more. It's about $1-$2 dollars more expensive than the other places in town but I've never felt like my rolls weren't worth the cost. Finally, Kristina is my favorite waitress. Maybe she remembered me for my order (hwe dup bap--seriously, try it if you love raw fish, it is divine) or maybe because I loved her so much I tipped well, but after just a few weeks of going weekly, a lot of the waiters remembered me and greeted me warmly. As a sushi lover, it doesn't really get any better than this. I'm not going to lie, Kofusion hits your wallet pretty hard but in the world of sushi, I don't find them especially more expensive than other sushi places that offer the same variety and quality of rolls. One recommendation I have is to try and get a roll (i.e. Big Roll--that's the one I had) wrapped in soy/rice paper. For those that don't like sushi because of the seaweed, this is a great alternative. For those that still love sushi, try it anyway--it's a great substitution that's worth it to get on its own once in awhile. I will forever miss Kofusion now that I'm not in the area so please, go get the hwe dup bap, Big Roll, Coconut Roll, or even the thai curry for me please!",

Anything with crab is easy peasy for a first timer. It was my first one.I slowly ventured into others and now I can eat almost anything and usually love them all. Most of their $1 sushi is delicious. If you are vegetarian, don't run away, their veggie futo roll/vegetarian maki is gross, but get the one you can custom make and have them tempura fry it, they might give u some crap about not being able to tempura fry it but they can and it will be yummy, I guarantee it!They also have tiramisu, which is great because I love it. And a bunch of other fusion dishes for the non-sushi eaters. I don't know why people complain about the decor, despite the glass bricks, it has a pretty cool contemporary/marina style...which kind of makes sense, duh.",

I also hate it when people think that this is the best Sushi place in CU without trying the others.Sushi is expensive. I also understand that not just any restaurant gets access to high quality fish, especially in bumble fuck Chambana. None of these justify the price premium KoFusion demands over the (superior IMHO) Yelowfin, not to mention the also rans Kamakura and Miko. If decor doesn't matter, and cost is an object (when is it not?) Sushi Kame is the best bet.As for their rolls, I do think they can be good. When they are good, they are just as good as the above restaurants. When they are not, they suffer the same perennial complaints for not being well rolled or being skimpy. I have not heard any complaints that their fish was bad, and I grant that this in itself is an accomplishment. The chirashi is reputedly quite good, though I have not had it.Their \"deal night\" is not really a deal. They get you in with the promise of a cheap meal, but the pieces that are $1 each are really tiny. If you are a person who normally orders 2 rolls, you will not be happy with your 10 small (but good) pieces. You will end up ordering an additional roll and maybe more. If that additional roll isn't one of the ones that are in the 10 pieces for $10 deal, prepare to wait for an eternity and a half.",

Their miso soup is excellent, and for desert try the red bean ice cream, sounds strange, but its delicious! They also have a great selection of martinis to pick from. The service is always iffy, but the last couple times we have lucked out with good servers. But either way you can usually find me here on a Sunday or Monday getting my fill of yummy yummy sushi!",

They also have more traditional stuff for purists and a large organic menu of seafood-restaurant-style dishes.Haven't found any other sushi place in town that is as good.

The red dragon was especially great with the sriracha on top and the additional fish in the roll. Loved the flavor, didn't even use wasabi/soy for the red dragon half the time.Also, both rolls came on plates with a fair amount of extra eel sauce. So many places cut back on the eel sauce for no real reason, but it's fantastic and I loved wiping up the extra sauce.Overall, I'd be willing to go back.",

My dinner selections focused on Japanese items, which were of high quality - sashimi pieces were HUGE and sushi rolls, while small, were mostly tasty. I was fairly impressed at how fresh the fish was, but taken aback by how costly the sushi was.Patrons seemed to mostly be from the university - a bunch of students and some professorial types. Kofusion certainly is the place to see and be seen in downtown Champaign and it's going to be a place I'll surely check out every time I visit the in-laws.",

Not quite enough vegetables though for my liking, but the flavor overall was good and it taught me that I need to work on my chopstick skills a little more too! Speaking of chopsticks, our dinner group was all White and then one biracial Asian/White man and he was the only one to automatically be given chopsticks and the rest of us got asked about whether we wanted a western or eastern eating utensil! I could believe it, especially as a race researcher myself. Pretty funny stuff. What if that one biracial Asian guy didn't know how to use chopsticks?? That would have been all kinds of awkward.

HOWEVER, I had a very negative experience tonight and I will not be going back. Let me tell you why. First off, we had waited over an hour for our food and when it arrived it was cold (which we found out after a few bites). We had asked our waiter if he could replace our food with freshly made/hot food. He asked the manager and he said that they were only going to replace what was left on our plate. We understood but wanted to talk to the manager in person about our poor experience thus far. The owner/manager is Janet. As we were talking to her, calmly I might add, she started raising her voice to us and said \"If you don't like it you can leave\". We hadn't done anything wrong and she was literally \"shooing\" us out of the restaurant. We asked if we could talk to another, more reasonable manager. She replied that she was the owner and the only manager. We then asked for her name. She said that she wasn't going to tell us her name!!! After telling us to \"get the hell out\" and threatening to call the police we then asked a waiter for her name. After finding out her name we left. Unsatisfied with just her name and no clue who else we can talk to about this extremely poor service, myself and one of my friends went in to calmly ask the hostess if she knew anyone else we could talk to because obviously Janet was too unreasonable and unprofessional to talk to. She spotted us and continued to yell at us to \"get the hell out\". Even yelling to my female friend that she was disgusting. A male server then proceeded to physically shove us out of the restaurant. Keep in mind, I am never one to be angry or be assertive in these types of situations. However, this was ridiculous! I have no idea how she is a manager of anything!",

I know sushi can be expensive, but I thought it would be something more of \"Chef's Choice\" trying to use up what wasn't purchased over the weekend. You're better off going a different night to avoid the crowds and just order the rolls you like. The rolls themselves were decent, but not the best I've had.",

ONE DOLLAR!  \r\rI've never eaten off the non-sushi menu, but I have had the sake mojito about a million times.  I did not like it as much as a rum mojito at first; not sweet enough, a little sour for a mojito, but it is quite distinctive and grows on me every time I have it.  \r\rThe ambience, I believe, is as good as it gets in champaign.  Nice tranquil water fountains and fish tanks and high def tvs with fishtanks and water fountains playing on them.\r\rService varies.  On one dollar sushi night it (understandably) takes a while for the food to come out, and the politeness of the wait staff during that lengthy interval is not always as high as it might be.",

It's a great way to test out some of their menu options without breaking your bank.The lunch buffet is outstanding- they always offer 3 types of sushi in addition to edamame, spring/egg rolls, rice, and chicken & beef dishes. It's hard to pick what to put on your plate.The specialty cocktails are pretty good too, if a little pricey.Overall, if you get a deal it's worth it, but I've definitely had better sushi.",

The open floor plan, changing lights and fish tanks make this place a fun place to sit and have a meal, too. Our waiter was one of the nicest guys I've talked to in a long time, and he was quick with a refill or a table clear. Also, this place serves a delicious mojito made with sake instead of rum.

The servers are great and the $1 sushi Sunday crowd was huge and happy. Happy? I'd say so! You just can't beat being well fed on fish and having an appetizer and a drink for $20.I looked at their regular sushi menu and was surprised: It is pricy in comparison to SOCAL sushi but I suppose location and limited competition have an impact, so I'll stick to Sundays. Their Big Roll was a nice surprise and there was enough spicy tuna to keep me happy. Next time I'll pass on their very average deserts and instead opt for MORE sushi!",

If the place was out of chicken, we didn't have chicken.  No running to the grocery store and lowering quality just to keep it on the menu for the night.  I definitely witnessed a great deal of dedication to the food by the head chef, and if anything makes the place expensive, it's that dedication to always serve the finest ingredients.  That being said, I can only apply that to the kitchen that prepared the entrees, or cooked food.  The sushi obviously must travel some distance to get to Champaign, but the quality is the highest that can be expected that many miles from the ocean.  So if your looking for a place that will prepare simple, elegant meals using top ingredients and organic meat, this is your place.",

They wasted four hours of my time and showed me how not local and not fresh the food is. Really, they aren't unlike many other restaurants now a days. With so many people to feed and pressure to make money, there isn't much choice. I was excited to go to a \"hip\" place and work with sushi, something I'd never done before. But the other employees were hipster-ish and snobby. I go back there because the sushi is enjoyable and my boyfriend likes it. Last time we went (6-6-10) it took us almost 30 minutes just to get our check, because the owner didn't schedule enough people. I'm a waitress; I understand this issue. Naturally, we still tipped our waitress. However, when people come into town, there are many many restaurants I would recommend before KoFusion.",

Dessert was good according to my kids though they didn't finish it, so it couldn't have been that good. I've not seen them fail to finish chocolate cake before. In all, it's over priced, decent food with not so great service, but excellent ambiance.  Great for impressing your date, but not necessarily great food or service.",

The atmosphere (which I admittedly can't speak in detail about since we were sitting outside) seemed...I don't know...off. However, by far the worst was the terrible service we received. Maybe he was just having a bad day, but our server really seemed to cop an attitude toward us and took FOREVER tending to our needs. Twice, someone from my party actually had to get up and retrieve him from whatever he was doing so he could actually, you know, do his job. This really should not happen, especially at a place that bills itself as such an upscale, better-than-the-average-restaurant kind of place.This really soured what should have been a great experience. I may give this place another chance some time. However, it'll be a while before I do. I guess if you really have a hankering for sushi, you could do worse.

Not once, not twice, not even three times...on the FOURTH try it was correct. And every time, the waitress getting increasingly ruder. Finally, before the last time, I asked to have the owner come out, which she did and was somewhat apologetic, but still acted like it was no big deal!I ordered a scallop curry dish. It was strange to say the least, and they cut the scallops in half crosswise! Bizarre, other than they were trying to make it look like my overpriced tiny \"sea\" scallops were worth it. They were the smallest sea scallops I've ever seen. I am from New England, but I am not expecting the same seafood in Illinois, but COME ON! You aren't fooling anyone. I am amazed anyone really thinks this is a 5 star place. It was the worst restaurant experience second only to the time I ate at Miko's...that was worse.",

In addition, one dollar sushi definitely is enticing and worth your money. But if you don't go during one dollar sushi hours, it gets a bit pricey, as it should. I do believe that Kofusion's ambiance is interesting. It's a darker place, with glimmers of neon lights, kind of like a classy club.",

Seafood in the Midwest is absurd to purchase, so I expect it to be a little pricier, but it's fairly comparable. Today, we ordered an app, two bar drinks, three rolls and two desserts and it was $63. Not bad, IMO. I always wish the menu was more descriptive, especially about what sauces come on which rolls. I about burnt my lip off today. The service is hit or miss. Some of the staff behaves a little lofty, but maybe that's what they think people expect. Or maybe some people are just assholes. Anyway...if you're on the fence, go for dollar sushi and give it a try. You can order online, which is sweet. If you call it in, make sure they read it back. So...four stars for a lack of consistency.",

Of course, the waitress suggested dessert.  We passed.The restaurant offers various specials, including an Asian buffet until 1:30 pm on Saturdays.  I would highly recommend finding out what the specials are and planning your visit based on the specials.  The lobster roll WAS really tasty but PASS on the flaming phoenix roll.

It's central Illinois so you can't expect the best raw fish in the world, but Kofusion tends to be overpriced for what you get.  I have a ton of food allergies/triggers so my review now is different than what it would've been 5 years ago.  With sushi I can pretty much just do seaweed, rice, and fish.  I can't do all the extra ingredients that Kofusion tends to overdo.  My favorite is just a plain'ol tuna roll (raw tuna, rice, seaweed).  I got this the other day when I was there and it was like $8 for 6 small pieces.  The worst part?  The fish really wasn't good.  Other places in town are either much cheaper and tastier or they at least charge for the better quality fish. The only other highlight I'd say is that I do like that they serve white ginger and not the pink kind. Bleh.Again, go there if you want to impress someone with the cool ambiance, but the food doesn't support anything more than 3 stars.",

So, the only thing you can do is ask.  And, I would also ask whether the meat you're ordering is actually organic, because if the restaurant is willing to mislead their customers about the fish, I wouldn't trust them about the meat either!

That doens't say much, however, since Miko's food sucks big time.  I love Ko Fusion sushi - it's creative and the ingredients are top notch.  But seriously, the price is ridiculous considering Sushi Kame makes rolls almost as good for half the price and none of the attitude.  The fish entrees are always good here, but stay away from non-asian dishes - especially pastas or anything Italian.  You would do better with a frozen dinner and I'm not kidding!",

A tad pricey, but good for a celebration!  Had to park a couple of blocks away, but it was a Saturday and graduation, so...",

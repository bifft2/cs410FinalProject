                "review": "Went here on Sunday for the annual Founders Cook Out. Showed up shortly after 2 and was in for a long long day of drinking and eating. The event started at 1, with the first special keg of KBS '15 being tapped at 2. Arrived right at the initial pouring. Got one of these extremely rare beers. We found friends in the upstairs mezzanine, and talked a waitress into allowing us to move a table next to theirs (even though there was a sign on the door that they wouldn't seat people until the full party had arrive; what is this, Black Dog?)As we got seated, I ordered the steak (at least a pound) rare. Locally sourced foods, cooked great. I can live with that. Kridz ordered the pretzel bites. Food arrived promptly (it doesn't take long to rare up a steak). Served with some delicious veggies and something else on the plate, that I don't remember. Steak was awesome. I was really in the mood for steak. The pretzel bites were pretzely and bitey. Served with their cheese sauce made with dirty bastard (I believe) it went well with the founders theme. There was founders schwag on the table. We left it, I don't really need anymore beer schwag, and if I did, i'd just call up a rep and ask for some. As I finished my kbs, I ordered an All Day IPA. Because, well, I was going to be drinking all day. As our friends left, we migrated downstairs. The bar was full, so we sat by another friend who was playing pool. Our waitress that we had upstairs kept us for the whole day, and was very attentive, filling our waters and letting us know when the next tapping was coming up (even when we were sitting at the bar). The second special tapping hit at 4 pm. It was KBS 14. The harsher bourbon notes that were more present in the newer model, had muted. It was a very nice sipper. No serious alcohol burn either. Good notes of dark chocolate, a little figgy and dark fruits (think a little raisin), on a nice base of beer. It might come across as a little chalky, but still a darn good beer. After we moved to the bar (by another friend), we had asked what the deserts were. There was a chocolate cake, and a cheese cake. I love cheese cake. Well, our waitress overheard us talking and put one in. I don't think we were ready for it, but what the heck. Cheese cake showed up, i'm not NOT going to eat it!At this time, (just after 4) I texted a buddy informing him of the event, he loves kbs, claims it's his favorite beer. But he couldn't come, because his wife is a paramedic and she was on duty, and he had the kid. I told him CBS was being tapped at 6, and that he had 2 hours to find a babysitter. I don't think he tried. Well, I informed him that I planned on having a $125 tab, and with the addition of the cheese cake, it was probably gonna be $150. At 6, we ordered the CBS. It's flavors were much sweeter (as it's been aged in bourbon then maple syrup barrels). Not quite as chalky. Good maple notes. Would go good with pancakes. At this point, someone down the bar had their food delivered. They got the pork belly. A friggin half pound of pork belly. It looked like heaven. I was tempted to order that as well. I was seriously VERY close to ordering that as well. It's like... a half pound of extremely tender BACON!!!I somehow managed not to get that. :(Then we left. Come back next year. Oh, went back on Tuesday night and had another KBS 14. Then went back on Wednesday for the beer club. (you don't know about beer club?)",

Well, now the Office is closed, and I feel like Crane Alley is shell of what it used to be.  In fact, I never go out in Urbana anymore.One star for serving food all night, and one star for never being too crowded and loud.  If I only have expectations to hang out with friends at night, I'm not disappointed.  I loved the food about 3 - 6 years ago, but recently, the food quality has declined and the service is horrible.  We met up with friends there, they had been there for about an hour.  Let's just say we got our food before their order was taken.  We were at adjacent tables outside.  At lunchtime.  Bad.Why the third star?  This is where my boyfriend and I went on our first date over three years ago.  Obviously, it was a good date.",

                "review": "I recently made a trip back to Crane Alley for dinner, and was dismayed by the alterations to the menu, primarily the price.  I remember buying affordable sandwiches for around $6, but all sandwiches have been bumped up to the $8 to $9 range.  ($8.50 for a falafel sandwich!?  Really!?  Those falafels are little nuggets of luxury now...) Quality of the food ranges from standard to good, though there is usually nothing here that smacks of culinary sophistication (especially to justify charging $8.50 for a falafel sandwich!!).  When I'm feeling indulgent, I order the fish sandwich, which is all the greasy, crunchy-crusted fish I could want.  Appetizers here are decent.  The spinach and artichoke dip tastes like every homemade version I've sampled from friends' kitchens.  The beet chips with goat cheese are considered one of their hallmark dishes.  I agree they're good--when prepared properly.  It's a gamble.  Because of the color of the beets, I think it's difficult to distinguish when they're finished cooking; I often get beet chips that taste like black charcoal.When friends propose coming here for happy hour after work, I just kind of dread it.  Crane Alley presents itself as a bar/pub, but they are more like a formal restaurant that expects everyone to stay in their assigned seats.  As someone who's waited tables in the past, I know large groups are challenging, but the waitresses here look downright insulted when they realize they have to serve our table.  They mostly avoid our group and hope that we won't ask for anything more than one meal and one drink.  Once, we showed up at a busy hour with a group of 8 and had to wait to be seated.  No big deal.  No one was complaining, we just stood in a group and chatted amongst ourselves.  After a few minutes, the hostess approached us, obviously annoyed, and said, \"If you have a group this big in the future, you're going to have to call in advance to make a reservation.\"  ...Ugh, really?Sadly, downtown Urbana does not offer many options for night life, especially if you want to have a nice drink with your meal.  Crane Alley has broad appeal and is a general crowd-pleaser, so it is a safe option for a date or outing with friends.  Just make sure you don't bring too many friends.",

I would stop in every now and again, but not very frequently due to the prices.The last time I went was about 5 months ago.  I don't know what happened, but the food was TERRIBLE!  I had butternut squash ravioli in a cream sauce and it was just awful.  No flavor, completely devoid of seasoning and the \"sauce\" may have been the Elmer's paste that comes in the little tubs with the brush attached to the cap.  It was actually grey in color.  Gross.  My husband had a chicken sandwich and it was small, cold, and cost about three times what he'd have paid for the exact same sandwich (quality wise) from McDonald's.The evening set us back about 60 bucks for a salad, appetizer, two entrees and two draft beers, which is pricey for CU.  So not worth it.  We have no plans to go back.",

What kind of establishment tells customers (who are seated and hungry) that they cannot order food? What a joke! We asked for salsa and chips and were told that we could not order anything. It took everything in our power not to walk out. Once we finally were able to order, the staff and management stared at our table and could not wait to take our plates. I was not even done and told the manager to leave my plate. This place is ran poorly and needless to say, our group won't be back! There are many better places to eat in the CU area!",

There is a nice beer garden in the alley next to the bar. Plenty of goodies on tap and in bottles. Boulevard Smokestack offerings, some Flossmoor Station, Two Brothers, DFH .  A really good bottle list too.  I believe they also have a monthly beer club that meets here as well.The food is great. Lots of sandwiches and several other entrees that are top notch. They have the best fish sandwich in Champaing/Urbana. A good burger and Reuben.  About the only thing I have to complain about is the service. The waitresses can be slow and don't always get the order right. Besides that a great place to quaff some quality beers in downtown Urbana.",

                "review": "Crane Alley is by far the best Urbana bar. Well, okay, maybe that's not saying much, but this place does stand on its merits. It's equal parts restaurant and bar; you can get a drink or a meal whether you're at a table or the bar. There are also a couple of pool tables across from the bar, and when it's warm out you can sit at a table in the eponymous alley next to the bar. (Do this at night--it can feel downright romantic beneath the strings of little lightbulbs.)Crane Alley has an excellent beer selection. They always have a dozen or so good ones on tap, and the bartenders and servers are knowledgeable enough to give recommendations. (I think they do beer tastings and whiskey tastings, although I've never been.) The liquor selection is good, with an emphasis on whiskey, and there are a couple of menu pages dedicated to sweet cocktails. I usually ordered beer here but the few mixed drinks I had were well-made.Food-wise, they serve burgers, pasta, steaks, and appetizers. I was an especially big fan of the Portobello mushroom sandwich (a burger-type sandwich with a mushroom instead of meat, and roasted red pepper, feta, and pesto) and the potato pancakes (a decently-sized appetizer that comes with asparagus and a tasty cream sauce). My only complaint about this place is that some of the meals feel overpriced--my friend ordered the hanger steak once and it was not $16 worth of steak. Oh, and I wish they had kept the beet chips on the menu; paired with a goat cream cheese for dipping, they were awesome, but they disappeared from the menu sometime last year.Downtown Urbana actually has a handful of restaurants and bars, but for whatever reason most of them feel like exclusively townie haunts. Crane Alley and Black Dog are the two exceptions, and unless you're specifically in the mood for barbecue and are willing to wait an hour for a table at Black Dog, Crane Alley is the place to go. It's too far from campus for the undergrads, so it's usually a mix of grad students and professionals. You can eat a burger at the bar, you can grab a beer and play pool, or you can treat your date to fancy cocktails and a nice dinner in the upstairs loft. Highly recommended.",

I will say though that if you go to Crane Alley, it's not as cheap as some of the other area restaurants (esp. not the alcohol). Another thing my friends and I noticed is that if you get appetizers, they normally give you way more dipping material (hummus, spinach and artichoke dip, etc.) than you can use up with the pita provided. You will get charged extra if you ask for more pita.They always have a nice selection of beverages, particularly beers, but there's a cocktail list as well (again, just plan on it being pricey). If fresh and local is important to you, they also sometimes have menu items made from products of sellers you might see at Market at the Square in the summer. In the end, it's a great place to go when the weather is nice and you can sit outside in the evening with your friends in the actual alley part of Crane Alley.",

It was, like, one of the most yummy things I've ever had. I never saw it again :(. I came back here, I think, three more times. Still yummy and then progressively less so. I think two of my least favorite things that I've tried (here and in my life time) were their spaghetti and lamb meatballs (which was laughably overpriced for how it tasted) and their Cuban sandwich. The spaghetti dish was bland and mushy. The lamb uninteresting. It was a comforting meal, but seriously disappointing for its price and for the standards to which I held Crane. It... sort of tasted like Chef Boyardee. I like Chef Boyardee (I know, guilty, repugnant pleasure), so I'm not saying I absolutely despised it. Just... Not great. The Cuban sandwich broke my heart. It really did. I was expecting a Cuban... Like, you know, a pressed Cuban sandwich. Like, you know, a Cuban. Well, it came on a sub, not pressed, and sliding around in its mayo. Not pressed. Not impressed.I'd most definitely come back for the salmon burger though.",

Now I live really really close to the infamous Kuma's Corner in Chicago--their burgers are so famous they've been featured on the Food Network.

Today I had the special--1/2 burger with mole, roasted chilies, pork shoulder, and chihuahua cheese--oooohhhh yes.Aside from tasty burgers, their beer selection rocks.  They literally have one full page of IPAs.  And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Their draft beers (which I believe rotate?) are quality as well.  The place is big, their outdoor (alley) seating is great in the summer, and the service is good.Though I must warn you... my first time (in the summer) was during some crayfish special... tables of rowdy bikers cheered on ladies in leather bumping and grinding in their laps.

When I brought it to the waitresses attention, she argued the point. Finally, we were able to demonstrate that the beer really was less than 12 ounces and she took $1 off the price of the bill. I prefer restaurants who take their customers more seriously than this.",

You can sit at the bar and enjoy, shoot some pool with your friends, or you can have a more private table in the back 2 stories of the restaurant that are quite and comfortable for having a nice meal. Then during the warmer months, you can sit outside on the sidewalk or in their quaint, creatively-decorated alley that is right next to the building (hence the name Crane Alley). The ambiance out there is top notch and I would highly recommend it any time the weather is nice!",

In addition, it will have more than 10 draft beers at any one time from various microbreweries and craft breweries.  The reasons to stop by don't stop there, since there is also a fairly extensive menu of tavern-style food, which is higher quality than what one usually comes across.My favorite appetizer is Crane Alley's signature beet chips. Every table around us got this appetizer, since it is one of the dishes that Crane Alley is most known for. The beet chips come with a bowl of a goat cheese dip (which has cream cheese mixed in). The dip is somewhat rich and heavy, and helps to bulk up what might otherwise be a rather light appetizer.The sandwiches at Crane Alley run up to around $10, and the main courses a bit higher than that. Last visit, my girlfriend got a portabella mushroom burger, which was one of the daily specials, and of course had no meat. However, it was bulky enough to offset that and not be as light and unfilling as a lot of vegetarian food ends up being. I got a beer-battered fish sandwich, which was crispy and fairly large (way too much fish for the bun), along with the sweet potato fries (another thing Crane Alley is known for). One of the complaints I usually have about fried fish sandwiches is how greasy they are, but luckily this sandwich didn't fall into that trap.The primary lure that Crane Alley has is its wide selection of beers and drinks, which can be ordered alongside a selection of appetizers or food (something some local competitors do not offer). In addition, it has weekly special dishes and daily specials, and special beer and food pairings on set dates (tickets must usually be purchased). I would highly recommend anyone in the area or at the university make the effort to stop here at least once.",

The patty was perfectly cooked and flavorful, and I could imagine obsessing over it like they did in the episode...TV-related gushing aside, I really like this place. We also tried the steak frites with gorgonzola butter on top, and those were wonderful, and the beer selection is great. I like trying the flights myself so I don't have to commit to a full version of any one thing.The normal fries are not great. Nothing especially wrong with them, just... not great. Also, the steak sandwich was good, but whereas the steak sandwiches I'm used to are best shared with at LEAST one other person, this is more of a one person sandwich, unless you're not that hungry.Be sure to keep up on their facebook page; they have awesome beer dinners or other cool events from time to time! I went to a great beer and chocolate pairing a few weeks ago, and keep hoping there will be another.",

It was competently fried and the sauce had a nice kick to it, albeit bordering on pizza sauce. We ordered the turkey pita sandwich and the chicken parm. Don't mistake that to mean that the sandwich was in the pocket. No, the fillings were served between two cold halves of pita. The chicken parm was mediocre at best, more likely just plain bad. Managed to burn the top of the mozzarella and still have borderline doneness on the breast. The worst part of it all is that this place is priced like a downtown Chicago eatery. I will say, the staff was courteous and friendly. Ultimately, this is a bar. If you want a plethora of beer and cocktail options and maybe a burger: go for it. If you want a decent meal at a reasonable price: Steer clear.",

At that point, we were told the wait would be 20-40 minutes.  After an hour, still with empty tables, we went to ask.  She said she'd seat us in 10 minutes... and finally 30 minutes later after bugging her twice more, she got us a table.  The bartenders actually compted us the pool because they felt so bad.That being said, our waitress was very friendly, though not always present, but very accommodating.  Food was ok, but we were annoyed that we waited 1.5 hours to be seated when there were empty tables the entire time... we started to wonder if she was mad at certain wait staff members and trying to spite them by not sitting people in their sections. That being said, I have had much better experiences there, and I hope that never happens to anyone else.",

                "review": "Stopped by here for lunch/dinner (it was 3...what meal does that count as?); it was pretty quiet since we didn't come during regular lunch/dinner hours.  Crane Alley is a \"Restaurant & Bar\" but it definitely feels more like a bar than a restaurant--it's very dimly lit, there are pool tables and a large bar area.  I guess if you like bars/feel comfortable in bars you probably won't notice this.I got the veggie sandwich and it was amazingly good.  Please allow me to list the ingredients of this most tasty of sandwiches: cucumber, bell peppers, onion, tomato, sprouts, lettuce, basil oil, sunflower seeds and dill cream cheese, all on two big slices of wheat bread.  The greek pasta salad was also tasty, and overall it was a very satisfying, generous portioned meal for a little under $7.My boyfriend had a hamburger and it was HUGE.  The fries were good and he liked the burger (although he said it had some kind of seasoning on it, which he seemed kind of \"eh\" about).Between the two of us we spent about $15 (before tip and without any drinks).  Not bad.  The desserts also sounded really good (flourless chocolate cake...mmm...) but we passed on that this time.I'll definitely be back.  I feel like if I had any interest in beer then this would be my new favorite place, but since I'm not a fan of beer or bars in general, that's kind of a deterrent for me (completely aware I'm in the minority here).  Oh well.  I'll still come back for their yummy food.",

Sounded amazing but as it came, it was just a big bowl of chips and barely any sauce. It just seemed so plain and the ragout was just a dark mush of sauce that seemed like it came from a can. Nothing about it was special and this cost $14. I asked the waitress for more sauce seeing that most of our chips were very bare, and later when the bill came, she had charged us for the additional sauce. When telling her we ordered more sauce because the chips barely had any, she said \"I'll take off the charge, Jesus Christ.\" She was definitely rude and hostile--unnecessarily. If the kitchen messed up and didn't add enough sauce, you don't really need to charge the customer.Either way, Crane Alley isn't on my list of placed I'd check out again. I'd rather check out Farren's in Champaign. The recent service and food option was definitely not something I'd want to experience again. Thanks, but no thanks Crane.",

Eating here three times, I have been very disappointed twice with my own meal and all three times with some aspect of the dining experience. Their menu sounds good, but is perhaps beyond the skill of its staff, as they often fail to deliver. Sauces are either too thin or too thick, either tasteless or too salty, and  every time at least one item was served too cold (even when it was just 2 of us). If you are the type that likes to occasionally order an appetizer for your entree, think again: many apps are really skimpy. Also, food service can be very slow at times, as I think they stretch their servers too thin. They also have very few vegetarian options, which surprises me, based upon their clientele.Notice how all these comments are about food? That is because their alcohol service, selection, and quality are all beyond reproach. Their prices, including their alcohol prices, are pretty high for what you get. For the alcohol, I can justify this to cover the cost of carrying obscure barley wines (tremendous); to charge high prices for the food, is absolutely unacceptable. EAT at V. Picasso's, Courier Cafe, Bunny's, Tang Dynasty, The Great Impasta, Xinh Xinh, Black Dog, Silver Creek, or even Siam Terrace, then DRINK at Crane Alley.",

I wish they had a few cheaper, more suited to a bar kind of appetizers than they do, especially since their above average overall food quality would make fantastic late night snacks.

I'm going to agree with that assessment: mostly good!I had the portobello sandwich, with peppers and a nice pesto topping. I was sort of disappointed when my friend said she wasn't into beet chips as an appetizer, but completely excited when I saw I could substitute my fries for beet chips! Yay! We ended up sharing the spinach and artichoke dip app. It came with toasted pita slices. Mmmmm. The food was interesting, and it was good. It wasn't fantastic, or mind-blowing, but it was solid, and the menu had a good variety of selections. The price wasn't super cheap, but it wasn't outrageous for lunch. My sandwich (plus beet chips, which do carry a surcharge as a substitution), my friend's entree (a bowl of the soup of the day and a Reuben), one soft drink and our appetizer = 28.79 before tip. The drink menu is HUGE! I'd love to come back for dinner and drinks sometime. The ambiance screams \"You're in a bar!!\" which considering that, hey! you're in a bar, that works. It was cozy, the lighting was low, the booths black - might be a nice place for a casual date. The one aspect that shone above all was the service. Our waiter was FANTASTIC. He was knowledgeable about the menu, helpful without being pushy or overbearing, very attentive, we had regular drink refills but he didn't make it hard for us to continue our conversation. He even brought us an assortment of to-go containers so we could keep the dip and pita chips separate - what a guy! That waiter deserves five stars (and a large tip)!",

Problem is - the pretzel dough wasn't baked today (maybe not even yesterday?)  - they take the pre-baked bites and put them in the (microwave?) oven for a few minutes and bring them out.  If you eat them fast you'll be okay...but once they start to cool they get hard (like - very hard!)  They come with cheese, which is - cheese.  Nothing special about it.The reality is that my appetizer experience (and the lackadaisical attitude when I asked about the appetizer) kind of turned me off.  I didn't really make it past the apps...  Being a \"gastropub\" I expected a bit more - like at least freshly prepared food - out of this place.  When I'm sitting at a table my appetizer doesn't need to come out at McDonalds speed (if I wanted that, I'd have gone to Mickey D's) - do it right and live up to the \"gastropub\" name.If you're eating *and* drinking, this is the kind of place to walk away from.",

The sweet potato fries are a must try, and I also love the turkey pita sandwich! Also a great selection of beers and full bar, not to mention a great atmosphere. I love to sit in the alley in the summer! Definitely one of my favorite spots at home!",

Only after I graduated and moved away did I come to like beer and realize how many opportunities I had missed in Champaign/Urbana...So when I was in town visiting, I finally had a chance to go here.  I thought the beer selection was good, but I would have preferred more options on tap.  Because I'm used to the higher cost of living in Ann Arbor, the beer prices seemed reasonable, especially for flights.  That said, I expected them to be slightly lower, since it's Urbana and not Ann Arbor.The menu looked great.  I got the porter marinated steak and was really excited because everything about it sounded like exactly what I wanted.  The food was somewhat disappointing, though.  I wouldn't say it was bad, but it was a little bland and just didn't live up to my expectations.  If I come back, I'd probably just get a burger or sandwich.Service was fine.  Our waitress checked on us just enough, and food came out in a reasonable amount of time.I'd definitely stop here again if I'm in the area, but I wouldn't be too upset if I couldn't.",

This place features all kinds of local beers from the IL area in addition to featuring a ton of other great microbrews from across the country. I wouldn't come here in a rush because you need some time to actually read through all of their beer selections there are that many! It is a mini binder, so come ready to read about beer, taste beer, and enjoy beer, and then maybe even play a little pool (until the pool league comes in that is, since they have a league here a few days a week!). They also have beer samplers and I have to say that Matt J. and I were very impressed with our bar tender in that she not only remembered the 10 different beers we ordered, but then recited them back in order in increasing light to dark beers as well. Amazing. That is the type of bar tender at a great beer place that you want. So hat's off to her! The food looked pretty good here too and everyone here just seemed happy in general. It is a darker bar restaurant on the inside so good for group outings or dates I would say, but if you don't like beer, you will be missing the main draw of this place!",

The breaded chicken breast was crispy and cooked to perfection.Buffalo Chicken Sandwich- very good- HUGE portion. I prefer to get the Buffalo sauce and ranch (can't have blue cheese while pregnant) on the side and dip- otherwise the breading gets soggy. Chicken is very well cooked. Italian Roast Beef- the beef used was too lean- it was dry and chewy. Would benefit from using ribeye (like on a good Philly cheesesteak) or a well braised chuck roast that has enough fat to keep the meat tender. The au jus was not very flavorful- tasted mostly like oil + red pepper flakes. Nice beer list- they have beer dinners, ($65 or $75), but they wont' discount the ticket if you are unable to drink alcohol (e.g. pregnant me)- otherwise my husband and I would have loved to have gone to one.",

The beer selection here is impressive, covering a wide range of styles and breweries from around the country.  I consider myself fairly familiar with the microbrew landscape, and yet they still had about 12 beers that I had never even heard of, plus, Crane Alley does modestly priced flights of 4 x 5 ounce tasters ($6 + a buck for the really obscure  choices).

He said he hear it was good. It wasn't. Before I begin, the food wasn't bad per say but it wasn't great. And for the price of the burger I got. It DEFINITELY wasn't worth it. I got the 15$ burger thinking, well it's the most expensive one, should be pretty tasty right? WRONG. I substituted the fries for the soup of the day which was jambalaya. +2.50$. Blah. The jambalaya was actually pretty decent. Not amazing but it was pretty hardy. The burger came out and it just seemed like crane alley was trying to do too much on one burger. It had blue cheese, Dijon mustard, bacon and a few other things that didn't go together great. I've also forgot the name of the burger. It was the only one over 14$I almost gave this place 2 stars but I felt kinda bad because it seems like they have a good beer selection and the staff is very polite. Would I go back? Probably not. Rather spend my money on the better places to eat in Urbana champaign. :-)  I would consider going back for a drink but nothing else.",

Charming interior, prompt service, and tasty eats!Holiday fate included Irish stew, corned beef & cabbage, rare bit, Irish soda bread, and a platter of all of the above. Of course, I opted for the platter to get a taste of everything.- Corned beef and cabbage was nice spotted in the Irish stew. Mmm...- Rare bit - basically cheese on toast, was horrid. Soggy bread with fake, melted cheese on it. - Irish soda bread - classic!- Irish stew - infused with lamb, potatoes, and veggies. Very nice on a cold, windy day.As for drink, I had my usual Strongbow. They don't have it on tap, just in a bottle. Eh, next best thing. Can't stand the taste of it out of those yucky cans.",

I enjoy the lunch half and half option with the garden salad and soup du jour. The vinaigrette dressing is tasty.Cons:Price -- a little hefty compared to other restaurants in town. A beer will typically cost $7 - $8. A sandwich at lunch is around $11-$13. I would definitely recommend bar service if you have a small party. Service is much faster!",

When I got that urge, Crane Alley was one of the options.  When they put out the tables, and the tiny lights are lit, sitting in that alley, traffic passing by, it's easy to forget-- the stress of the day, the problems at the other end.  But, booze is booze and as far as CA is concerned, unless you're drinking off the tap (which is a good option), it don't come cheap.I will say this... drinking here is a different experience.  There's a sleazy undertone, stuff's dirty, bartenders (and even the barbacks!) are rude (dismissive).  And it's not because they aren't making tips... leave your money on the bar, and they'll just help themselves (had it happen numerous times to me... as a matter of fact, one actually wrote _in_ her tip on my credit card, once).  I wouldn't spend the money on the food.  You can find a hundred different places near to have a better meal.  If you're just gnoshing to keep up with the liquor, that's one thing, but if you want a bite with a beer, try everyone's favorite, Farren's! =DAll together, if it's what you're looking for, CA fits the bill.  There are better places out there, though.",

The sauce is incredible, and the cafeteria design means you don't have to worry about tipping.  Perfect. Some of the best BBQ this BBQ connoisseur has ever had.",

However, very expensive for the amount that you get. Our guest really did enjoy having BBQ as an option though so it served its purpose well. I did look at their menu to see if there was anything that I would be interested in ordering in the future. My go to order for BBQ is a chicken sandwich. But Hickory River doesn't have that. They have a smoked turkey breast though. Don't know how that makes sense.",

I'm pretty sure there were no other ingredient. Mac & Cheese: disgusting. Probably from a vat purchased at GFS. Fried Okra: crumbly, bland mess. We tried this place because we were tired and hungry and it had a drive-thru and no wait. Black Dog is minutes away but didn't want to bother. That was a HUGE mistake. Lesson learned. If you want GOOD food, it comes with a price. Crappy fast food? Readily available. But it also comes at a price.I'd like to note the customer service was very polite and friendly. ***I have no knowledge as to whether or not there is actual MSG in their product and I make no claim that there is.",

It's actually our hidden little secret. SL isn't historically known for the BBQ, but I've had my fair share of wonderful smoked, barbecued, and grilled meats.   My wife (and 10 week old) left pleasantly surprised that we found a four-star BBQ place here and mentioned we'd be returning sometime in the near future. It was a Friday night after 7, so not super busy, but it had a good crowd of families and some couples' date nights.  Ambience/fell:  You stand in line cafeteria style, with relatively small menus along the wall to be ready for your order up at the upgraded cafeteria bar. As you order, they put a few quickly served items on your red tray and a couple plastic name tents on their for anything that'll be served in a few quick minutes after you sit. The line went pretty quick (about 15 people=7 minutes), giving us a time to look over the moderate-priced, moderately sized foods (it does give a single $ under the name). There are plenty of items in the $4-$7/8 range, but some impressive-looking ribs and other cuts of meat in 'plates' (+2 sides) for about $12-$15.  My meal:  I got the pulled pork sandwich. It was good. The pork wasn't seasoned to taste, but moderately juicy and absorbed the sauce well. I thought I'd take him up on the mix of spicy and not spicy BBQ sauce - the sandwich came smothered in it (messy, but just the right amount of sauce in my opinion) on a soft bun. The portion was plenty for my moderately hungry appetite, but I was definitely over it by the last few bites.   Sides:  I added sweet potato fries (we love SP fries, and the friendly regular in front of us said he doesn't get anything else) and were looking for another appetizing side. The 'server' or worker gentleman recommended the mashed potatoes since I said my wife wanted to stay away from spice - I guess the Ranch Beans \"have a little kick.\" Needless to say, you don't go to a BBQ place for the fries and mashed potatoes. SP fries were significantly overcooked and slightly burnt and the mashed potatoes were a step above KFC's - perhaps a bit like a cracker-barrel style with a scant amount of light brown gravy.  Wife's meal:  My wife ordered the pork nachos. And we actually really, really liked the nachos. When we return, that's definitely going to be a repeat. The chips taste homemade, crispy and flavorful and are smothered in pinto beans (with juices), a plentiful helping of pork, and this really yummy queso sauce (kind of tastes like the queso dip from Chili's). Everything was really well dispersed too, which doesn't always happen at places. If we were more shameless, we would've licked the plate clean.  Sorry for the long post, but hopefully it helps.",

I only take one star because of its location and I only eat the brisket, so I can't really vouch for anything else (though the husband likes everything else he's tried)  The mixed sauce was a little hotter than I was expecting, but I think that is just because I've got weird pregnancy hormones that make everything taste either hotter or less hot than they actually are.  That being said, their sauce rocks my socks and the brisket is so tender and yummy.  Not a \"classy\" place, with the paper towel rolls on the table and the silverware up by the register, but it's a BBQ joint.  It actually seems more appropriate that way :)",

Where's my mustard sauce? (Let the great debate begin!)Anyway, I got the pulled pork sandwich with mixed sauce (they have a mild red sauce and a spicy red sauce, and mixed is... the two together), a side of cole slaw, and a side of mac'n'cheese (all three ran about $8 together). The pork was tender and had a good flavor. The sauce was very smokey and on the spicy side..not bad but could easily overwhelm the pork. I also had a bite of my friend's brisket, which wasn't nearly as good as the pork (brisket just isn't Q where I come from). The mac'n'cheese was stouffer-ish, but the slaw was great! Pretty solid. Complaint: cobbler and cornbread should be served warm.I'll be back once I check out the other BBQ places in the area!",

I have Yelped over 200 places and this is by far the worst cash register employee I have ever encountered. I've seen people who were lazy and not very smart, but no one has been as condescending and impatient as the hag that is taking your order at this restaurant. If we literally took more than one second to tell her what we wanted, she would roll her eyes and talk down to us as if we were imbeciles or something. I definitely did not appreciate that. Also, I definitely think BBQ tastes better if you truly take your time with it rather than outright rushing it (Well, I suppose this is fast food BBQ after all). I will say that the mac n cheese was quite delectable. The cornbread was also delicious, but had severe diminishing returns on flavor.",

Frozen GFS corn, over salty oddly-flavored beans, flavorless mashed potatoes, and distinctly \"meh\" fries. The biggest disappointment was the mealy brick of cold corn bread.

The price was reasonable too, as their large beef brisket (which is 8 oz) was $9.50, coming with two sides of our choice. The ranch beans was awesomely cooked.If I could, I'd give them 4.5 stars, but 4 is too low for them. You ask why? Well, I was expecting it be a bit more elegant. For example there is no waiter service. You enter their store, get into the line to order, get your food (very quickly) on a tray and then will go to find a place to seat. Another reason I wanted to dropped a half star is that they didn't accept my DISCOVER card (Although I'm kind of used to it, but nevertheless a nuisance). Another thing is the pricing on their small beef brisket. They ask for $8.50 for the small one, and $9.50 for the bg one, thus they're totally urging you to eat more (Not that the meal is bad, but too much meat isn't good for your health anyway).Btw, the sandwich prices are very reasonable, with most of the sandwiches being a measly $3.99. I didn't try them, but they come in small burger buns (think MacDonald's $1 burgers size) but with meat extruding from the bun, like twice as big as the bun itself. I guess it is probably enough for a meal.   Another good item on the menu is \"meat from the pit\", which they sell by pounds. Basically if you want to bring them home, this is the best deal. If I'm not wrong, it was $9.25 for a pound of their awesome beef brisket (the same price goes for all other BBQs as well). I'll remember this deal for my next home party!All in all, a good place to eat. I'll put it in my regular eating place list from now on.",

The coleslaw isn't quite what I expected, so if you're a fan of creamy coleslaw, skip it.  Atmosphere is VERY Texas, which leads to the Sooner fan in me resisting the urge to turn all the longhorn artwork upside-down.  (Guess now if it ever happens, you'll all know who to blame!).  Reasonably priced, and the service is outstanding.  Catering is top-notch, too; we had them cater our wedding rehearsal dinner, and every aspect of it was friendly, professional, and outstanding.",

Then you slide the tray to the cashier and select a drink.  You carry your own tray to a table you choose and they do the clean-up.Brisket is a specialty.  Sauce can be ordered hot, mild or mixed.  They also do a sliced turkey.  Meats can be bare on a plate or in a sandwich.Its very casual, TV sets constantly going, of course, because this is America.",

HR's is great for the area it is representing, if you took that brisket anywhere else in the country and put regional sauce on it you would come out on top.  I like all the sides, particularly the FRESH cole slaw, and I usually get chili and put some onions and sour cream on it.  Sweet tea is good, occasionally it is a little weak but always ok, maybe has something to do with how long it has been out.  I saw some people whining about plastic plates and cafeteria setting, or it was too country for them, where do you think you are?  Order a sandwich, take it to Starbucks or wherever you sample your brie, and quit whining.",

The BBQ sauce is OK but nothing that spectacular.  The potato casserole was not that good.  It had a funky flavor I could not figure out.  The green beans on the other hand were good.  I ordered the pork loin and the pork itself was very good.The sweet tea was VERY weak.  As my grandfather would say \"the tea walked through on stilts\".  It has no flavor what so ever.I would not make a point of going here but if someone wanted to go I would not protest.",

The staff was friendly and the order was all correct. The pulled pork was to die for! Both the spicy and mild bbq sauces received great reviews from the party. Compared to Black Dog, Hickory is better for bigger groups and the wait time is way shorter. If you are craving bbq i would definitely recommend giving Hickory River a try.",

The waitress said they are very busy but the place was at 40% capacity. I understand if things are going slow but the amount of time before we even got our menus was a little ridiculous.Second biggest problem is that nothing comes out at the same time. We had a party of 6 and 4 menus came out, before the next 2. Only 4 waters came out, before the best 2. All of our burgers came out at different times. Also, between each visit from our waitress, there is a long wait.Now the food. I got the California burger with onions rings. The burger was extremely bland, you hardly notice there is guacamole, bacon or basically anything. I'd be shocked if they even seasoned their burger patty. Only thing worth anything was their perfect onion rings. Today they had half off burgers, which is the only reason why anyone should try their burgers. At full price, I'd rather go to Burger King or TGIF.It's also unfortunate that their 2.00 bud light draft special was broken. I thought they'd replace the deal with something else other than can bud-a-ritas...If you really want to try this place come for half off burgers. On a Thursday. I'm thoroughly disappointed.",

I've had most of the burgers without mushrooms. The Bob Marley, Spazzle, Four Twenty, Dick Butkus, and California are some of my favorites.

At least it has an outdoor section for the nicer times of the year which is a huge relief when you want to get out of the sweaty inane madness that is Joe's.",

The girls behind the bar never really seem to be on top of things, but I've never had an issue with service. This is a great spot for lunch or early dinner.",

Nobody tipped, and the food was lukewarm by the time she served us. We had to hound her to even pay for the meals. What a horrible waitress. She really should be fired.

I've been here a few times and tried their burgers. They're alright. The mac n' cheese side is an upcharge, but it's pretty good, very heavy. Recently, I ordered a veggie burger with no bun (not about to waste my carbs budget on some basic ass bun, ja feel?) and the whole bottom of the burger was burnt and seemed to have something stuck to underside of it. I'm guessing the grill just hadn't been cleaned in a while...If you want a good burger, go to Seven Saints or Destihl. If you're more of looking for a place with a college atmosphere, come on in.

The Mac & cheese isn't necessarily worth the $1 upgrade, so don't bother - unless you want to pay for boxed mac&cheese that has some bacon bits tossed on top. They have a good selection of beers and sodas (be aware that it's not Pepsi *or* Coke products but RC/Dr. Pepper). I thought the draft of Bell's two-hearted complemented my Urbana veggie burger quite nicely. If they'd offered ice cream for dessert, it would have been true love. Also, note that it was very crowded (and noisy) indoors but that they have an extensive patio. There was an upstairs space as well, but they apparently only open that for table service *some* of the time.",

I actually prefer a lot of their sauces over that big-chain wing place (which I won't name). The wings are really big and only 33 cents. I like that you can get as many of any flavor as your want without an extra charge. My favorite sauces are the jerk and tequila lime.Their sides and burgers are really good, too. {EDIT} We went to wing night again last night and got onion rings. I can't think of anyplace that has better onion rings. They're not frozen, obviously hand-dipped. They even give you the fried crumblies. Holy moly, they were so good. Nice staff, nice place. I like going here because it has a neighborhood bar feeling.",

It caters to bikers as well as family plus has a decent- sized  outdoor lounge. Food specials daily but Fish Fridays serve up the largest and best cod sandwichs in C-U hands down! Always clean, fun, and comfortable for what looks like a dive bar next to a strip club. Actually was built in a self serve car wash structure. With the new owners the place now rocks out with live bands. Check it out cause you won't be disappointed.",

Don't be. This place looks like an absolute murder-me-in-the-bathroom-and-serve-me-as-patty-melts-next-Tuesday shithole. Its not. Its a moderately divey outdated (vintage 1986 decor, probably ironic in hipsters' eyes) bar and grill. High points include a pretty new version of Golden Tee, a juke box, a friendly guy slinging drinks, and most rewarding: a fully integrated theme of boomerangs. I wont be a spoiler, but you will love pointing out all the boomerangs, like its Highlights magazine. They have domestic macros on tap, a full liquor selection and daily lunch and dinner specials. I'll probably go back for the Friday night fish fry.Bottom line: don't let the fact that it is next to a strip joint and bumps up to a pretty questionable area chase you away. If you are a diver, dive in.",

I assumed because this bar was located behind the silver bullet strip club that this would be a great dive. I was wrong. Upon entering the establishment I was greeted by the bright glow of lights. When I want to drink at a dive I want the lights dim. The bartender was nice but the place was empty. My girlfriend and I ordered our drinks and shot pool and joked about how at 9 o'clock on a Saturday we were their only customers. Eventually 3 regulars sat at the bar and when I went up to the bar one of them told me my girlfriend was pretty and he wondered if we were going to visit the bullet next door. That's enough to make me uncomfortable and bail on out. I might come back on their wing day for 33 cent wings but I will never come here to drink and unwind because the atmosphere sucked, the air was stale, seriously no fans or AC, and the clientele is either non existent or just a little too creepy for my liking. My search for a good old fashion dive in CU continues...",

In general, most of the more complicated items on the menu are frozen and microwaved when you order.Their breakfast offerings are not bad.  The breakfast burrito and breakfast pizza are both pretty cheap and reasonably filling.  In fairness, I have heard their grilled cheese and soup on Thursdays is good.  (I haven't had it myself.)The lunch dishes are not as good; the options change each day.  The ones that are good are .. okay, and not that pricey for near campus.  The ones that are bad are pretty bad.The nachos are alright - canned pickled jalepenos, diced up tomatoes, olives, thick tortilla chips, gloppy cheese.  There is a lot of it.  Not bad if you have a craving, but there are better options elsewhere.The salsa and hummus plate's not bad for a snack.  Of what I have had here, I would recommend it most.The hamburgers are gross.  They taste like school cafeteria low-grade meat and have the texture of frozen sausage patties.  My girlfriend's cheeseburger had a big piece of scorched .. something on top of the cheese.  Mmm.  The \"albacore tuna with mango\" sandwich is alright, but the mango is mixed in with the canned tuna, along with a lot of mayonnaise and relish.  There is not much mango to be found either.  (I've noticed charred bits on the breakfast sandwiches too, which is baffling considering I think they are just microwaved.)For sides: the low-fat cottage cheese just tasted off.  I have eaten a lot of cottage cheese and never had it taste like that - kinda chalky, kinda sour.  My girlfriend got the pasta salad, which was a little better, but swimming in vinegar with some pepperoni plopped down into it.  Our iced tea was very opaque and did not taste very fresh.  They charge for refills on soft drinks, too.Service was alright, the kitchen guy is cheerful, but the food was unpleasant enough at my last lunch that I'm not going back.  Within the same walking distance I can get to Derald's lunch truck and Espresso Royale - and I've been much happier with the food at both.  Or Red Herring, or Bevier.It is worth noting that I paid with gift certificates - none of my own money - and still felt disappointed at the cost of free.Can't comment on the baked goods, haven't had them.  What I hear is that the stuff made in house isn't great, but they get the cookies from elsewhere and they're okay.Also, after hearing - from one of the staff - that they don't change out the coffee every day in the pots, I am knocking it down to one star.  Just, don't go here except maybe for the nachos.",

If you're trying to really fill up, this is a place to get \"the bang for your buck.\" In addition, the nachos were tasty. While they weren't the greatest nachos I've ever had, I'd certainly put them above mediocre.Yesterday, I did half a sandwich and a soup. I chose turkey and swiss on challah and red pepper & gouda soup. The sandwich wasn't that much to write home about (though I was happy to see challah, even if the student working behind the counter didn't know how to pronounce it...) but that soup was fantastic. Seriously, I would eat that stuff by the gallon - so savory and creamy with little cheese chunks hanging out in there. OH MY GOD YES.In short, I'll probably be back. It's kind of a wheelhouse restaurant but I think they do a good job at it.",

Coffee and soda are cheap.  Best bet for a good meal is to get a sandwich, we made those fresh to order (dinners are just microwaved).  In the daytime there's an assortment of baked goods, at night it's just cakes & pies.  If it's going to be a busy night and you want food, make sure to go early to get a table and get your food in time, as there will be a long line.Tip - if you want something to eat during intermission, place your orders ahead of time, and it will be waiting for you at a reserved table when you get out.  Only desserts and drinks are available after the show ends.There's a parking lot underneath that used to be free, and street parking in the neighborhood is usually easy.",

Make sure you get their emails and only go on days you get the email or call there first.  Walking all the way there and finding them closed is annoying, especially on short lunch days. Check your order if you get it to go (this is good for any place you go but especially here).  Mistakes happen often. Their tomato soup is like tasteless tomato water (the grilled cheese that goes with it is almost equally tasteless).",

I think I'd rather eat junk from a vending machine next time.We had a BLT. I've never before had a BLT that used diced tomatoes and shredded lettuce. At least nothing about the sandwich was actually horrible, but when talking about a sandwich that should be as simple to do well as a BLT being mediocre and the best part of a meal....We also had the Chili, served in a bread bowl. It was thick and gummy, reminding me of Hormel's canned product. blech.For sides, we had the \"Three Bean Salad\". I don't think I've ever had a  three bean salad that featured bits of broccoli or some kind of mysterious yellow disk vegetable. Other than mysterious extra ingredients, I do not recall it being particularly horrid, but it certainly was not something I'd order again. We also had the Potato Salad,  which was decent but kinda sweet.The Iced Tea a fright, with a very industrial taste.Vying for best part of the meal with the mediocre BLT were the Oyster Crackers that came with the Chili. They were made by Nabisco, not my favorite brand, but they were fresh.",

                "review": "Pros: Great homemade food at a great priceCons: LocationMy Advice: Go on a Friday or Saturday night, when you can get a Twice-Baked PotatoI have been living in the C-U area for a little over 2 years now and I made my first visit to The Apple Dumplin' just 3 nights ago. We absolutely loved it! Enough so that we went again last night. Their twice-baked potato was fantastic, one of the best potatoes I've ever eaten. The only bad thing it that they only serve it on Friday and Saturday nights, so if you go any other time, you're SOL. On our first visit, my son, my step-daughter-to-be and I all got beef and noodles. The children's version is served with mashed potatoes on the side, while the full-size meal is served over a bed of mashed potatoes. It was delicious and also very filling. Even though it was the nightly all-you-can-eat meal, I was only able to eat one plate. My fiance ordered fried chicken and it was very good. Lightly breaded and juicy, just the way fried chicken should be. On our second visit I got the all-you-can-eat popcorn shrimp, the Saturday night special. Paired with the twice-baked potato, my meal was excellent. This was no tiny, marble sized shrimp; they were plump and perfectly fried. Not to mention, all-you-can-eat shrimp for only $8.75? Are you kidding me? My fiance got the beef and noodles, which was just as tasty as the first time. The kids got chicken strips and fries, which were just what you would expect, but the portions were huge. The staff is very friendly and they remembered us from the first time we were there. Our waitress even commented that my son had gotten a haircut in between. The salad bar is nothing super special, but it's adequate. I loved the cucumber salad and the kidney bean salad. Almost everything made here is done so from scratch. I don't know if the popcorn shrimp was, but the beef and noodles, fried chicken and mashed potatoes definitely were. According to the menu we brought home, they peel about one ton of potatoes a week. The homemade rolls are heavy and very good. Even better, they have apple butter in a squeeze bottle right at the table. I could almost make an entire meal of their rolls with apple butter. The only bad thing about The Apple Dumplin' is their location. They are located a few miles outside of town in the last place you would expect a restaurant to be. There is a reason it took me so long to come here....... because I didn't even know about it. We found it quite literaly by accident.",

If you are at all sensitive to social ambience and are not white, I do not recommend this place.  I felt too uncomfortable to stay, which was just as well because nobody tried to seat us or acknowledged us in any way, so after standing around uncomfortably for a while we left.  which is too bad because I like apple dumplings.",

I had breakfast with a friend of mine, and all was going well, weak coffee aside.  We ordered some breakfast, and the waitress (who turned out to be one of the managers or supervisors) asked if we wanted gravy on our potatoes.My friend said \"I'd love it on the side, please\" only to be told \"No.\"  When he said \"no?\" she replied \"Gravy is complimentary, and you either have it on the potatoes or no gravy.\"I made the choice then that if one bowl for gravy was too precious to wash, then I would save them the time and effort by not going back.

Today, it consisted of meatloaf, fried chicken, biscuits, corn bread, chicken and noodles, and assorted gravies. There was also a salad bar. Everything in the buffet was very average except for the fried chicken. After eating the other very average items, I was definitely caught off guard by the quality of the fried chicken. I can say without a doubt that it is the best fried chicken in town! It doesn't have that gross soggy thick batter. It's got a light coating that is perfectly crisp. I would come back just for the fried chicken! We also had the apple dumplings and ice cream. It was amazing! Imagine a whole apple, wrapped in dough and covered in caramel sauce. It was also a ridiculously huge portion. The caramel sauce had a good flavor but had a very strange gooey texture. I'll definitely make a point to stop by more often!",

The beef and noodles (all you can eat on Thursday) are exactly like what my great grandma used to make us, and the biscuits and gravy always take me back to mornings before fishing.  Be warned-the Apple Dumpling doesn't pull its punches.  The food is not healthy-it was designed for farm laborers, not office dwellers (or tractor riders), and is consequently heavy, hearty, and massively caloric.  You might think that some of the noodles are underdone.  You are wrong.  The noodles are made to different thicknesses on purpose, and some of them need to have more texture.  If nothing else, think of it as proof that a person made your food, not a factory.Here's the skinny (irony!).  If you grew up in the midwest, you'll know what's going on with one bite.  If you're from some other place, give it a taste and expand your horizons, but check your baggage at the door.  Like it or not, you'll leave a more cultured person.",

The menu is limited, and specials change from day to day, but you can expect to find fried chicken, pork tenderloin, meatloaf, Salisbury steak, and beef Stroganoff, pot roast and other Midwestern standards. Mashed potatoes with gravy, green beans, and corn accompany. They have excellent rolls and serve them with a squeeze dispenser of apple butter, making them ridiculously addicting.The eponymous and enormous apple dumplings are divine. Save room, you will not regret it. They are essentially cored apples, stuffed in cinnamony goodness, wrapped in flaky pie crust and baked. They are worth a trip in and of themselves.The decor seems a bit odd, but is well-suited to the restaurant. Country effects and pictures of family worthy of awkwardfamilyphotos.com adorn the walls. The walls are light, and the fluorescent lights are bright. Do not expect an intimate or quiet meal, but this works as this is primarily a breakfast and lunch joint (traditionally, farm families eat the biggest meal of the day at noon, and call it dinner, with supper in the early evening). The dining area can be crowded and loud, and there is a huge open entryway into the kitchen, so the curious can literally monitor everything that goes on in the restaurant. All this fits, however, as this is restaurant's honesty is bared for all to see and what is revealed is pure.What separates the Apple Dumpling from other restaurants is not just the menu items and decor, it is the sense of family. Servers, cooks, and other staff are clearly all from the same extended family and/or social group (probably the church across the street). If you happen to be of Midwestern stock they will serve you food that is exactly like what your mother and grandmother made, and that is a big compliment in my book.5 stars for the food, minus 1 star for a complete dearth of vegetarian and/or healthy options (other than a half-assed salad bar), a smallish parking lot, and limited hours of operation, minus another for no alcohol, but plus a star for the great prices.",

Spotless . I then touched the salad bar wagon - ice cold.. I already new that this is a place that takes pride in not just the taste but the preparation.The food for the Sunday brunch felt like you were eating a home made meal. The chicken was  the best fried chicken I have ever had and the pork loin was outstanding.  MY only complaint is that there was not room on my plate by the time I got back to sitting down and coul not try everything. You will walk out of there feeling you have had an amazing home cooked meal and you will not need to eat any more. Congrats to Jim and Kathie for providing and outstanding venue for people who want to eat the real deal..  This will definitely be added to our list of recommended pla",

The food was alright, not good enough to justify getting lost trying to find it for thirty minutes. Call me a simple gal, but give me the Cracker Barrel over this place any day.",

I have had the chicken and noodles, the beef and noodles, and the fried chicken. The food is pretty good. The quantities are nothing short of ridiculous. The bread and the biscuits are huge and just ok.  (Seriously, who can eat that much food?)  I would give it another half star if I could, but not another whole star. The salad bar is just ok. The atmosphere feels like 70s country kitsch, and one should redecorate at least once every 50 years. I am sure I will be back because there are folks in the family that love it. I enjoy it and endure it.  This place is sort of a culinary Rorschach test: if you love it or hate it, you are reading things into it that aren't there.",

It will serve you the friendliest of calorie-laden, heart-attack inducing greasy breakfasty diner foods and the like, and for that you must love it a little bit.  The country kitsch works here, and is worth a stop in.  I really did enjoy their biscuits and gravy for breakfast, which are filled with carbs and fat and love and all that one can ask for in Middle America.Their Sunday buffet is a little disappointing as it lacks any breakfast options, but the fried chicken is spot on.  It's worth coming once for the kitsch, twice for the biscuits and gravy.  Then you go to the gym and cry salty, buttery tears on your treadmill.",

If this place wants to make better business, I suggest they move to a location more visual from Route 45. On the other hand, I noticed a fellow yelper complain about the texture of the food but it was fairly consistent for my experience. Also, this location employees pretty young ladies, after all it is a college town. Ur welcome! ;) Only 3* for mediocre-ism",

There was a university of Illinois football game on. One of the waitress (not our, thank goodness) seemed to get very agitated if she found out anyone was rooting for the other team. She actually came up to our table, gave us a dirty look, and told us she has friends on the team. You can root for whatever team you want, but you probably shouldn't try to pick fights with customers when you work for tips!",

Didn't have the Hawks on any tv but our waitress gladly changed 2 of the Tvs so we could watch both the cubbies and the Hawks. Hooters wings are the same wherever you go. The fries were cold which was a bummer because our food came out in like 5 minutes. Also the \"talent\" of this hooters is top notch, I feel like some hooters have gotten lazy with who they hire and I will say this one had a great group of friendly ladies. Expensive draft beer, plus they brought me a bud lite when I ordered a Budweiser but I know it's just so hard to keep those 2 straight. Still beats going to an over crowded crappy service Buffalo Wild Wings, I'll be back again I'm sure.",

Well once a very long time ago, when I attended the U of I, my roommate and I were eating lunch here on a weekday and in walks Harrison Ford.  Thats right, Han Solo/Indian Jones himself walks in, by himself and treats himself to the delicious Hooters cuisine.  There must of only been about 3 or 4 other patrons where, so it wasn't a big todo or anything.  That is totally random (there is a airport down the road, and Hooters was on of the first restaurants you see when you drive up from it towards town, so he was probably refueling or something).   So +1 star.So that aside, as a fried chicken review, I give Hooter's Chicken 4 stars.  The very thing that makes it unique you either love or hate,  Hooter's batters its chicken wings.  Hooters also leaves the \"tips\" on its wings too.  You can ask for them naked, but as its kind of the specailty of their wings I prefer the batter.  The batter does soak up a lot of sauce and oil, so it is by no means healthy.  It does keep ok, but its better reheated if you let it go cold.  Hooters sauces are notoriously non-spicey (and I'm a big wuss when it comes to spice).  \"Hot\" is about medium, \"medium\" is less than what is considered mild at most places, it has no flavor at all besides a buttery oilyness for some color.  Please order at least \"hot\", don't be afraid, its not hot.  The fried buffalo shrimp are pretty good too (but they go too quick).  Grilled cheese was favorite too, but some of these options are not offered as many Hooters are franchised.",

We arrived and made a dash straight to the restrooms which we were happy to discover were very clean. We were a party of nine so they couldn't sit us at the same table so split us into two tables right next to each other, which suited us fine. Our waitress could not have been less thrilled to serve us. I don't think I saw her crack a grin, much less a smile, the entire time. The food was decent. The pancakes had a seriously tough exterior, but the eggs were yummy, the biscuits and gravy devine, and my toast wasn't overly buttered (Rebeca has me looking out for that now). I had asked for there to be two seperate checks since trying to figure out a nine person tab could get ugly, however when it came time to pay, one check. Thank goodness everyone just decided to split the cost, which was wonderfully affordable, instead of picking it apart cent by cent. Overall, a good travel spot for decent food.",

They stop cooking the food eve though people have still paid to be there!  The staff has been rude and slow for as long as I have been coming.

(By the way, you can find it on the second floor, northwestern corner of the Union.)  I would recommend this place for guests of the Union Hotel who want to stick close to their rooms, or anyone else who wants a slightly classier lunch option (compared to the mall-style food court in the Union's basement).  My department often takes visiting professors and job candidates here for lunch, mostly because it is no fuss yet still feels professional.  Although there are no actual restrictions against the public dining here, the location and atmosphere make it a more appropriate lunch option for the university community and campus visitors.  Food is served buffet-style, with daily soups, salad bar, sandwich bar, hot bar, and desserts.  In terms of quality, I'm pretty sure that the Ballroom uses the same food service company as the campus dining halls.  There's a good selection of crunchy veggies on the salad bar, meats and cheeses for sandwiches, and other items, but I can't help but feel that I'm reliving a slightly upscale version of my dorm years.  The hot bar is surprisingly good, and probably the only part of the menu that sees significant rotation (I've never seen the same thing on the hot bar twice in a month).  This can be great if you plan to eat here regularly and don't like repetition; it sucks once you've found something you really like and know there's a slim chance of seeing it again.  Some of the past items I've really enjoyed include: chicken piccata, eggplant parmesan, and potato-crusted fried fish.  There is usually a vegetarian entree and sides, and the staff are good at answering questions if you have dietary restrictions.Time has passed since Yelpers wrote about this place, and the price has rose to around $10 per person.  This price includes access to the full buffet, plus beverages, and I think it is comparable to what you'd probably pay at other buffet places.",

I highly suspect that's the primary reason we see Prof's and visitors here often.  I personally apologize for the food when there with guests. The waiters aren't really waiters, but sort of \"I'll get you your drink when I feel like it\"-ers & \"I'll just ignore this stack of used dishes while asking if you want coffee\"-ers.The dishes remind me of school cafeteria food but from chefs who passed the next level up of culinary cafeteria school.  I think I may have finished my salad. All else left me cold and wanting. Try to avoid if you can. (Unfortunately all my grad friends somehow think this is all a good deal for $10.)Seriously- can it be called a place to eat if they can't even serve a glass of coke with carbonation left? Do they pour them in the morning for the lunch hour?",

The last time I was here it was when a visiting scholar was in town, so someone got the bright idea of bringing her here. We loaded up our plates with watery cottage cheese and wilted lettuce and sat down. The conversation kind of mimicked the food: bland and predictable. Maybe you'll have better luck, but man, I thought this was just about the worst place on campus to eat. (See my review for the Krannert cafe, which is at least do-able.)",

But the food is done by University Dining Services -- the same people that cater meetings and events so badly.  The motto could be:  \"A dorm dining hall without the dorm.\"The one joy of the buffet line for me is its Midwestern-ness.  I occasionally see jello salads and ambrosia unlike anything I have ever seen on the West Coast.  Miniature marshmallows!   Fruit salad with... is that mayonnaise?  The salad and dessert recipes recall the Better Homes cookbook circa 1952.  But beyond these culture shocks there is little pleasure to be found.  It's expensive for the quality of the food.  The salad bar is tolerable.  The main dishes range from poor to horrible.  The sandwich bar features limp lunchmeats and tasteless bread.  If you like to snicker at such things, apparently the person who writes the buffet cards is often stumped by the exotic ingredients in some dishes.  This leads to platters marked as \"White Soup,\" \"Spring Salad\" or my favorite: \"Ethnic Dish.\"Note that the previous price listed is out of date.  It is now $8.75 for buffet, drink, and dessert.",

I really liked the atmosphere of the bar. It was a great place to watch the game I think next time but will just go for drinks since I didn't think the food was so great. I ordered the salmon slider and the salmon was so salty it was inedible. The other slider I ordered was okay nothing to rave about but the worst was the California turkey burger my friend ordered. The menu said it had avocado on it which it did but it was such a minuscule amount we literally cracked up about it.Its a clean bar and quiet enough to watch a game AND still hear the commentary but you might want to eat before you get there though.",

The slider was a little dry for me, but the salad was very good! Our server was very friendly and quick, and the location is perfect if you work near downtown Champaign. From what I saw inside the restaurant, it looked like a pretty calm atmosphere. Outside seating is very good! Overall, if you're looking for a lunch place, Seven Saints is a great choice.

The staff were friendly and knowledgeable both times, and they were eager to help suggest drinks to try.  The cocktails were tasty, although a little on the strong side for my tastes.  When we had a party too large for the tables in front, they gladly opened the back room for us to all sit at the same table.The sliders were good, the soup was hot and tasty, and I really enjoyed the casual atmosphere of the place.  I'm glad I'll be going back for my bf's after work outings.",

It's also the place I recommend when people from out of town ask where they should go for dinner. The service there is very friendly and prompt, and the food is good. I've never had the salmon burgers, but I wouldn't expect the fish dishes to be the best in the heart of Central Illinois anyway. The Buffalo Chicken Slider and Classic Slider with Cheese are my favorites, along with a side of waffle fries (although if you're a fan of sweet potato fries, they have the best in town). The chipotle ranch sauce that comes with the onion rings is amazing, the tomato bisque is absolutely out of this world and they have a great selection of whiskey and beer at the bar. I really think of this place as more of a restaurant than a bar though. They tend to get busy on Friday and Saturday nights, and if the wait is long, make sure you're back earlier than you think if you decide to walk around the area. Definitely one of the gems in Champaign-Urbana and a place that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good meal at a decent price.",

I believe this is a new menu item which comes with 2 giant soft pretzels, mustard for dipping, and an amazing jalepeno cheese sauce. The pretzel was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of salt. I could have eaten a bowl of that jalepeno cheese sauce.Main course: I love it when restaurants allow you to combine menu items, like any variety of a soup/ salad/ sandwich combo. At SS, you can definitely create a combo to your liking. I ordered the soup with half sandwich. The price and quality just blew my mind. You think a tomato bisque soup is boring? Seven Saints will change that opinion of yours! I got that tomato bisque soup with half a tuna melt sandwich and i was in food heaven.Dessert: It's very rare that I have room in my stomach for an appetizer, main course, and dessert. Well, I didn't have room, but that didn't stop me from ordering a sweet sensation. The blueberry cheesecake with ginger crust was absolutely incredible, and I don't regret that decision one bit.Service: Impeccable. I ordered an arnold palmer to drink, and I never saw the bottom of my glass. The food was prompt and our server was helpful. Even with the packers vikings game on TV, we had an extremely pleasant time.I know Illinois is known for good food, but man, I was not expecting this amazingness :) A++++++",

I typically came here on a date with the wife when she visited me during graduate school. We had to live separately for two years but enjoyed our evenings here before her flight home out of CMI. Although it's a whisky bar, they had an interesting selection of wine and beer. I always got the Mojo IPA and she got her Riesling. Aside from the relationship, this is also where I came to prefunk with the roommate before our Thursday night pubcrawls with the School of LER. Initially, my first roommate introduced me to this place when I first arrived to Champaign. We were paired by Burnham's roommate matching system. He was this smart computer science whiz. We drank here on weekends. He moved on to work for Skype. My second roommate was a Korean born Mexican. He was fluent in Spanish which culturally, he loved whisky. I think I was appointed as his wingman because he was this strange kimchee taco hybrid that was soaked in whisky that came off as a creeper. The Chinese Beijing girls loved him though and our strategies to get him laid all started here at Seven Saints. The irony is that, there was nothing Saint like going on at this establishment when we were there.",

I was even more hopeful when my friend and I walked in. The design of this place is awesome. It's really nice looking with good lighting. It looks trendy and cool. Unfortunately, it's an illusion to cover up the rest of the place. It's a pretty boring menu. It's American cuisine that focuses on slider-sized sandwiches. I had the fried chicken slider, and it was okay. Pretty much just literally fried chicken on a bun. It's not any better than I could have gotten at a fast food place, and for much cheaper. I wish I could have tried more sliders, but we were stopping in before a concert, so it was what it was. It's the kind of restaurant that is made to look like it's trendy but it's really just a normal joint with a nice paint job and design to it, and the ambiance isn't worth the extra price in my opinion. The food isn't bad, just average. What really brings this rating down for me is the staff. The service is absolutely terrible. First of all, it was so slow. We ordered one slider each, it shouldn't take that long, especially when the restaurant is packed. Not only was our waitress slow, but she was unbelievably rude. The friend that I went with is male. I, obviously, am female. I might as well have not existed. All of the questions, flirtations, \"are you okays?\" were directed at him, and when I said anything, I got an eye roll and a curt nod. I get it. Guys will probably tip you better. But that's no reason to just blatantly be a terrible server, because we obviously came in together, so you should probably be nice to us together. He was embarrassed for both of us, and made a point to try and ask me questions in front of her, but she just was not getting the hint. It was awkward for both of us, and helped to ruin an otherwise lovely evening out. I'd try this place again maybe if I'm ever in the neighborhood again, but I'd definitely be careful about in whose section I was seated. The second star of this review is for atmosphere alone.",

Finally my co-workers decided to make this the weekly spot to go out to eat, so I was more than happy to tag along.  We went around 12 noon, on a weekday.  The inside is pretty cozy and nicely decorated.  It's almost imperial looking with the large hanging drapes as curtains.  We had a large group of 10, and fortunately we were able to get a table.  The place itself seems very large, as there were from what I could tell, 3 distinct areas to sit in, and an outside dining area as well.All and all though, the place came across as very average to me once everything was said and done.   Granted the restaurant was pretty busy, it took our server literally 15 minutes to come get our order, and another 15 to just get our drinks (and most of us just had water).The food did not take too long to come out, but once again I wasn't impressed at all.  I got the club sandwich with waffle fries, and I can't say it was bad at all, but there was just not a thing special about it.  It's your typical greasy fare typee of place too... Fries oozing grease, bread and buns slathered with butter, etc.  I also tried some of the cheese curds (sounds disgusting, but quickly found out it's just like a round mozerella stick), waffle fries, sweet potato fries, and a classic slider (which apparently is what they are known for... sliders that is)  All of it was just very average, and even the acclaimed slider was nothing special.  I would probably not go here again if I had the choice, but other than I long wait to get waited on and an even longer one to get some drinks, there is really nothing too major I can dock the restaurant for other than it just did not appeal to me much personally.  I should note our server was very friendly, but I just can't really get into the food.  Just a very average joint.",

It has a crisp bed of greens topped with tiny hot green peppers and a VERY generous portion of pieces of steak. The steak is flavorful and moist and the whole salad has a clear dressing that compliments the other components perfectly. The best part is that you can have the salad as part of a special served with a couple of their sliders for around $8. It's a great deal.Speaking of their sliders, they have a really wonderful selection of mini-hamburgers. They aren't as heavily greasy as you might expect from a traditional slider. My favorites are probably the Asian slider with it's wasabi spread, the Buffalo Chicken slider (with an amazing sauce on a crispy piece of chicken and served with ranch dip) and the Blacjack burger. There are a ton more and pretty much anything to suit your taste.Another standout aspect of Seven Saints are their appetizers. If I have one complaint it's that they seem incapable of keeping their Beet Chips ready to order. Out of the five times I've tried to order them, I've only ever been able to get them twice. I don't know if I've just had bad timing or what but I do wish they were a bit more diligent with those. If you do manage to order them they are delicious and are served with a yummy goat cheese dip. If they are out of them, there are still a lot of great options. You can't go wrong with either of their mushroom appetizers.",

I was told they were famous for their sliders, so I chose the Chicago Dog slider, mainly because I love Chicago Dogs and also because it was out of the ordinary. The slider was very good, but a little overpriced. Not wanting to fill up on just sliders, I also got the Chipotle salad which was very well done and was tasty and surprisingly filling for a salad. I enjoyed the atmosphere- relaxed with good music playing. The waiter was friendly, but not very attentive, especially considering it was not that busy. I had to ask several times just to get a refill on my water. I often judge a place by asking myself if I would go back again.  For Seven Saints, the answer would be yes, if I happened to be in the area, but I wouldn't go way out of my way to get there.",

One of our favorite things to do together outside of work is drive over to Seven Saints for Whiskey Wednesday and just start buying each other rounds of amazing, 1/2-off whiskey.  1/2-off whiskey alone is worth 5 stars to me, but what really puts Seven Saints over the top are their amazing sliders.  They have about 8 or so different kinds and since they're relatively small you can comfortably have 2-3 of them in one meal.  Top that off with some waffle fries and ranch dressing and I'm the happiest camper.",

It's just.. it's so good. I've always been a ribeye steak fan, and in my teens when I first learned they make sandwiches out of them, I think I cried tears of joy. Ever since my first bite, I've been on the hunt for the next best ribeye sandwich.. and my friends, I search no more.I order mine blackened, medium-rare, with their delicious waffle fries. The first time I decided on this sandwich, I didn't have high expectations. I had ordered sliders here in the past and found them just okay. However, when they brought out my huge, melty, tender, delicious sandwich, I could hear the angels singing. It was GLORIOUS. I ate every single bite, and within 2 days I found myself back at Seven Saints, ordering another. This is my all time favorite steak sandwich, and I order it often.Aside from this amazing sandwich, the service is always good and the atmosphere is friendly and inviting. They even have ginger ale on tap, YES! Anytime I've been less than 100% satisfied, the staff has been completely accommodating and has removed any problem item from the bill, AFTER replacing it for me. I couldn't have better things to say about this establishment!",

Everything is very clean, and spotless. There is a wood bar and lots of tables and booths abound. Again, very nice and clean. Not a lot of character, but enjoyable.The quality is fine. Nothing wrong with the taps or bottles. The service is decent as far as taking orders and knowing what they have. Though I had to argue with several bartenders to get a half pint of a Barleywine. I don't know why that should be an argument?The food is decent. Though I am not really a fan of everything being a \"slider.\" That makes a lot of the menu a la cart. My first visit, I ended up with a steak salad, but there was not much steak to be seen. What was there was tough and chewy.  The salad was a bit slimy as well.  The sliders are nothing bad, they just never seem to live up to what I would expect from the description.Besides a few decent offerings, the tap list is pretty generic. Eight taps that consist of Blue Moon, Fat Tire Guinness, Magic Hat, some BMC, Southern Tier Seasonal, and a managers choice (Arcadia Barleywine when I first visited).  That rotates a bit, so the selection does change.  The bottle list somewhat makes up for the sub par tap list. Mostly the usual suspects like Rogue, Bells, Goose Island, Founders, etc. Overall decent, but not ground breaking (considering the handful of really good beer bars in walking distance).Overall, just an average place to grab a beer and a meal. A slightly above average beer selection, and slightly above average food. There is really nothing that distinguishes this place above the many other restaurant in the area, and there are much better beer bars in the area without a doubt.",

They're the size of donut holes (like those ones you get at dunkin donuts) and you get like 12 of them in an order.  I was full after two....

The salad I got - country fried chicken - was AMAZING. Their honey mustard dressing is light and tangy. I loved the many julienned red onion and cucumber and half cherry tomaotes! By far my favorite part of the meal. Now. The iced tea. Nuh-uh. Is NOT raspberry flavored. Very small cup for the price.I stole my sister's sweet potato fries and eh... Guido's has better. Seven Saint's fries are overly crunchy and weirdly shaped.My friend said the beer selection, though large, didn't have what he really wanted. Also, he said the Seven Saint's salad is a little...offputting. The lime and nut and fruit combo did not a salad make.The actual restaurant was pretty nice. Clean tables. The barstools weren't uncomfortably high. The service was nice, but slow. The server forgot my friend's beer, and was late with the drinks, but was very cheerful and helpful. My sister said the bathrooms were passable.Probably will come back, but will remember to get at least two sliders and a dinner-sized salad.",

There are old pews, vintage chandeliers, and a beautiful wooden piece in the back of the main room all from old Churches, and it was the 7th bar opened by the owner, hence the name Seven Saints.

I wish they had a \"slider flight\" option where you get a deal for 3 sliders or something. The service was prompt and friendly even with our large group. The sliders were.....okay......the bread was kind of mushy and not impressive. The garnishes were more like the quality you'd see at Subway and the beef reminded me of Wendy's or White Castle. Is it the shape, dense texture, or just general tastelessness? I can't quite put my finger on it but it's just not impressive considering its their \"specialty\". The prices are okay but considering that you could probably get better burgers at a fast food restaurant, I feel like they could be cheaper but I guess you're paying for the ambiance and service. Personally, I don't need ambiance, I go out to enjoy unique, high quality food. Ideally, rather than cheaper prices, I think just higher quality food would make more sense. On the plus side, I could see this place being good for picky eaters who are repelled by too many flavors in their food.",

Perhaps the owners need to start dropping back in or have people mystery shop the place.The menu - while not wildly innovative - was well thought out. The appetizers are well done and set up to share, though the fried portabella mushroom strips on the Seven Sinners plate had that 'I've sat in cold storage' flavor to them. That said, the cheese curds and also the beet chips were excellent. I liked the sliders - favoring the blackjack and the buffalo chicken slider. The triple-S plate used to be more of a deal when they would allow you to get two sliders and either a soup or salad. I was sorry to see that go. I've not tried the specials, and each time I've been everyone has done sliders, sandwiches, soup, or salads - so I cant speak to them. The desserts are nothing special, but were decently presented.Out first few trips, the staff was excellent.  We were seated relatively quickly despite being packed. Someone came to take our drink orders in the first few minutes. The waitress was willing to explain things to my party and make substitutions to satisfy vegetarian friends. The beer selection was decent and the mixed drinks were decently strong. While prices were a bit on the steep side, we were fairly happy. On a later trip, the service was slow, the raspberry iced tea was short on the raspberry syrup, and to be frank - I felt rushed out the door once we were done with our entree. That was too bad as the people I was with are the sort prone to ordering dessert and a couple rounds of drinks. If the place was crowded, I could have understood, but it seemed sort of empty.Other reviews have mentioned a chain-like feel. It's true the same group owns a few other local bars - so I'm assuming they use the same architects, designers, and back-office staff. That said, I kind of like the decor and think with a little work on the service Seven Saints could warrant four stars.",

I love the ambiance of the corner bar, dark wood, and dimly lit interior and the extensive offerings of specialty vodkas, gins, and whiskeys.  The cheese curd appetizer was very good but not out of this world.  The beer batter was a little soft and I suspect the cheese had not been frozen prior to deep frying (or not completely), which resulted in most of the cheese over-melting and dripping out of the solidified batter shell.  Still tasty, but missing the mark a little bit.  The sliders were pretty good, but the BBQ had too much botte-tasting sauce on it.  The beef was cooked perfectly though.  Caesar salad was average at best.  On the plus side, they have a nice selection of draft and bottled beer.",

It takes only about 3 to 4 sliders to fill you up, meaning this place has got some bang for its buck. The atmosphere here is great but the place is very noisy on a busy day. It's a place worth giving a shot, and even if you don't find yourself to be a fan at least it wouldn't be an expensive lesson.",

I still go back every year for Christmas to visit family and friends, and when I do, Seven Saints is a must-hit place for food. And I get the same thing every single time.The Triple S Combo Platter. One salmon slider. BLT salad (although I have also tried the Country Fried Chicken Salad... sounds weird but was really tasty). And the tomato basil soup. This is a trifecta of yumminess in my tumminess. There has only been once when the food all tasted kind of off, possibly a bad day. But every year, it always pleases me. And the bill isn't so bad. I don't really drink here, but have had a mojito that was alright, nothing special. I will continue frequenting this establishment for my yearly Christmas visiting. Please stay in business Seven Saints, otherwise I will be forced to make this food on my own and it won't be pretty.",

Exactly, what I was thinking it's not Tuesday Brewsday or their famous Whiskey Wednesday's but a Monday! I had no idea that they have Ribeye dinners on Mondays and 1/2 Price Wine by the bottle. If you are looking for a dinner cure to your manic Monday I would totally suggest Seven Saints! The steak was cooked a perfect medium per my request and was served with broccoli and mashed potatoes. I think the 1/2 off wine bottle speaks for itself. Iggy was my server for the evening and he gave us the best service even though we arrived 30 minutes before the kitchen closed which was 11pm. Thanks Iggy!! Hope you find this review useful!!",

The train got in over an hour late (which seems to be a common occurrence on this route), but I was still a few hours early for the game, so I grabbed some lunch at this place, which is right across the street from the Amtrak station. I was happy to see that it was not jam packed on game day morning. I was by myself so I sat at the bar. I was impressed with the large selection of beers available, both on tap and by the bottle. I'm used to Chicago prices, so being able to get a good draft beer for under 5 bucks was great. They also have Miller High Life on tap for $2 if you're looking to go \"cheap.\"Food wise, I went with a couple turkey sliders, since the menu claims that is what they are \"famous\" for. I also had some of the sweet potato fries. The sliders were just okay, I wasn't blown away by them or anything. Same thing with the fries. The portion was large, but I wasn't crazy about them (I went ahead and doused them in ketchup after I realized they weren't that good). It was a meal that was adequate, and not expensive (each slider was $2.50 and the fries were $1.99 if I am remembering correctly), so I'm not complaining. My total for 2 draft beers, the food, and tip was just over $20.The bartender introduced himself as \"Billy Mays\" and had on an Oxyclean shirt, which was his Halloween costume. He was nice enough and occasionally engaged in small talk, even as the place started to get more crowded. I didn't have any problems with him keeping my water and beer full, and my food was correct, so no issues there.When all is said and done, I can't give this place 5 stars simply because I wasn't blown away by anything. But this is definitely a sold 4 star establishment.",

I particularly recommend the buffalo chicken slider- easily my favorite. Do yourself a favor and ask the waiter/waitress his/her opinion on the amount of food you order- it's very easy to order too much for your party to handle.Beer: Some great seasonal beers on tap for not too much $. You can expect to see draft, seasonal beers for $4, and other beers for cheaper. There are tons of draft and bottled choices. This place has a great bar to sit, watch games, and enjoy an ice cold brew.Service: I was only with one other person so we asked to sit (and eat) at the bar. We had 2,3 staff members (bar tenders) help each other out when it came to waiting on us. They have a team approach- which leads to faster service. The bartenders knew their Illini sports, cared about the downtown Champaign environment by knowing about that weekend's events, and were very down to earth.Overall: I had a fantastic meal, including appetizers, and a beer for $21. A similar place in Chicago would be double that- and the food wouldn't be better either. Downtown Champaign has fantastic bars and eats, and this place is one of them. Seven Saints covers all of the bases- i've eaten here with my family for special occasions, and i've come here in the wee hours of the morning to get my drink on.",

My fiance and I waited at the bar for a drink for about 15 minutes before anyone asked us what we wanted. That may not sound too long, but the place wasn't even busy. And what's funny is the bartender was like purposely ignoring us. There's no way she didn't see us politely flagging her down. She had a soft drink that she was drinking, and she stopped right in front of us, took a nice looooong drink... kind of relaxing, then she looked past us out the window, and proceeded to ignore us a bit longer. And its not like we were just standing there, you can try and flag them down, but they just ignore you like alien possessed humans staring into space or something. The bartender finally asked what we wanted, but by then we were being seated so we said nevermind. Then we proceeded to have terrible service at our table, to the point that it was just kind of amusing. Oh and my cobb salad had these huge mushroom tentacle things that made me gag and we just sorta wiggled them at our friends like \"look at this huge sick thing that's in my salad!\" And the sliders are way over priced. The cheese curds were good, but a little heavy. I say the place has potential because it's a really nice location and the inside has a nice ambiance. There is also an extensive beer list, but none of that really matters if your service is that bad...",

The food: the cheese curds are okay. I'm not sure why everyone thinks they are so incredible? Maybe the massive size? The sliders are pretty good, but I don't think the quality warrants the price. I had the black and blue salad and it was a huge portion for a half size which was awesome! But the taste was not there. It was pretty awful.

I truly believe they need to decided which one they are. The menu is confusing and to extensive. They have a lot of options and the combinations are limiting. I got a Black and Blue Salad and my husband tried the bratwurst slider and the fried chicken slider. The fried chicken slider tastes exactly like a McChicken!!! Truly amazing.... Only the real thing is bigger. The bratwurst slider was ok. The meat was good, the bread was soggy and the sauerkraut was lacking in crunch. My salad was ok in flavor. The meat was microwaved and had no crispy ends... Clearly reheated. The mushrooms were soggy and had the same look as large slugs. The soup tasted great!!!! But after asking if it was homemade, our server said it was bagged. We were offered the shrimp tacos, but the shrimp is previously frozen too. I'm still disappointed in Seven Saints. They need to decide what they are. A fancy bar or an American lunch spot, they can't be both. It's not working.  I would love to see the mood lightened and the have a fantastic sandwich shop instead!! Or, simplify the menu, make it classy and keep the dark dinner atmosphere. Sorry I can't do better, but I don't lie in my reviews.",

We got there around 8pm. I knew this place was usually busy but when we put our name in, they said it would take 30 minutes. So we figured we would wait since we had not been there in a long time. After an hour of waiting, they were able to seat 6 people. The other 6 had to wait for an adjacent table to open up. It did not open up for another 30 minutes. So I was just really confused on how they would tell us it would take 30 minutes when really it took 1 hour and 30 minutes. The first half of our group had already ordered for us in an attempt to save some time since everyone was starving. After we were seated, it took about 10 minutes for our server to come ask us what we wanted to drink, and then another 10 minutes to actually get our drinks. The food was alright. I usually get different sliders, but decided to try the steak sandwich. It was pretty good, a little messy though since there was a ton of oil that came with it. After we finished, the guy took all of our plates, and then it took 10 minutes for him to ask us if we were ready for the check. then it took him another 10 minutes to get us the check. And then another 10 minutes to charge all the cards. That was one of the worst dining experiences I've had. Over 2 hours of just waiting for things. You would think that with a larger group, he would have paid more attention to us but guess it doesn't work that way.Like I said earlier, I've been here before and they were ok experiences, which accounts for the 2nd star. But we'll see if I ever go back in the near future. Just pissed that we waited so long when the server kept saying it would be 5-10 more minutes every time we asked.",

I've never heard any complaints or noticed any discrimination or racism. People are overwhelmingly happy with their experiences here, as evidenced by how busy it is. Wednesdays do tend to get hectic, so if you are high-maintenance / demanding / have a chip on your shoulder, you may want to pick a different night to go. If you're a normal person like 99% of the other people around, you'll have a good time.With that out of the way, Seven Saints is THE PLACE to drink whiskey, especially on Wednesday, with a 1/2-price special on one of four rotating themes. Every whiskey they have is in one of the themes and will be 1/2-price on its respective day. They have an incredible selection with a whole menu page or two for each theme. The bartenders that work that night are passionate about whiskey and it shows. They know their stuff and can always make a good recommendation based on what you like, tell you why they recommend it for you, tell you what to look for, and answer any questions.",

But this place is a sanctuary for the rest of us who just like to drink whiskey and eat tiny burgers with our friends. I highly suggest the salmon sliders although at $4 a pop they are pretty costly. I pretty much only come on whiskey Wednesdays so I can sample the best that they have. The waiters are always really helpful and will suggest whiskey for you to try even if you're not used to drinking them. Seating can be limited depending on what time you come but if you can grab a table outside during the cooler nights of summer, you'll never find a better place. It is on university so it can be a bit noisy due to traffic.",

On a Sunday evening, we were seated outside immediately and our waiter was accommodating and attentive without hovering.  We each ended up going with the slider and salad combo with sweet potato fries on the side.  I chose the salmon slider (complete with cucumber and dill sauce) and the salmon salad (a more Mexican take with a southwest ranch dressing) & I was extremely content with my choices; even having some leftovers for lunch the next day! In my opinion, the portions were definitely very reasonable.  The sliders were about the size of the diameter of a standard water or beer glass or at least that is what our waiter told us! Seven Saints ended up being the perfect spot to catch up with old friends over some delicious food; I'd definitely recommend this joint to anyone with a rumbling tummy in downtown Chambana!",

Their food menu has a nice balance of innovation and old standards and was well-executed for everything our group of 6 ordered. Service is quick (turn and burn, baby!) even when they're full. If you are careful, the food and drink is actually quite reasonably priced: soup/sandwich combo, 2x beers, huge club with excellent sweet potato fries all for $30 (whiskey tab was a different story- but worth it). You certainly could spend more on you food here, but if you get the cheap stuff you will still be happy. Also, on Wednesdays, they have HALF price on all their whisky/ey!The bartender also runs classes on the appreciation of this complex but enthralling (some would even say intoxicating) beverage.",

I had a trio of Sliders: Asian, Tropical Stack, and Salmon, served with Sweet Potatoe Fries.I grew up in an area that had White Castle restaurants. Now, I never went there unless pressed, but I do know what a slider is.The problem with these was not the taste, which was fine. Nor the size, which was small. The problem is that sliders are moist / greasy. Now, I'm not saying that having a non-greasy slider is a bad thing from a healthful eating perspective. But if you're going to call something a slider, there has to be something non-dry about it. sigh.Service was friendly.I would like to get back there and try some other items, but we always seem to think of someplace else we'd rather eat.",

If you order sliders they just come out on a giant white plate and it sort of detracts from the food. I'm serious--it's a big plate without even so much as a green piece of garnish and the sliders are just okay anyway. The service is average though servers can seem scarce because it's always so dang busy.",

The crowd was what looked like a mix of graduate students and older couples.Seven Saints is known for their sliders, these mini burgers, kinda like what White Castle serves. The sliders are about $3 to $4 bucks each so it's perfect for ordering a slew of them. I ordered fried cheese curds  for appetizers which were delicious though a little soggy (then again, anything fried pretty much tastes good). There are plenty of vegetarian options. Any slider can be replaced with a boca burger (50 cents extra), but in my opinion a boca burger patty overwhelms any other taste. So what you end up with is pretty same tasting burgers - my boca blackjack cheese slider tasted like my Asian one. The waffle fries were especially good though (better than The Office's ones in Urbana IMO). The beer selection is limited so this place is decent to take group for dinner - there are better bar options for drinks elsewhere. The service was adequate and attentive, but not overly so. What's with the Third Eye Blind love? There were like 3 TEB songs that played that night :S There's also some outdoor seating. I could definitely image coming back here for lunch.I also like the fact that Seven Saints is directly across from the bus/train station (who needs to spend 10 bucks on a cab when there's convenient public transportation nearby? My friends rode their bikes here and took a bus back home (they have racks on the front of the bus to load bikes).All in all, Seven Saints is a decent option for lunch and dinner, but you can find better spirits elsewhere (i.e. Blind Pig, others)",

I'm boring and stick to the bacon ones, but on occasion I branch out; the tropical ones are also really good. What really sets this place apart are the chicken tenders, which are the best I've ever tried. They're reasonably priced and listed on the appetizer menu, but totally worth getting as a main course. The tomato bisque is apparently very good as well (but screw tomatoes, I'm sticking with the food).As good as the food is, the bar is even better. While the drinks are a bit expensive, if you come on Wednesday, various whiskeys are half off. They also have specials on Monday and Tuesday for wine and beer, respectively. I love the bar selection, though. Wednesdays are my favorite day, because I come to Seven Saints and try various whiskeys to sort out my likes and dislikes. If you (or someone you know) is trying to get into whiskey, this is a great place to do it. My personal favorites are the Elmer T. Lee and the various shades of Pappy they have (especially the Old Rip Van Winkle which is fantastic). My only quibble is that the whiskey passports are a bit of a ripoff. It's $5 for the little book, but normally that'd also come with some sort of swag (like a t-shirt or glass) when finished. It'd make a nice little memento for finishing the entire (64 entry) passport. Still, a great place and such a minor nitpick it barely merits mentioning. Seven Saints is fantastic.",

Hey everybody has an off night! My husband and I enjoy not the run of the mill beers and we were surprised to find extensive selection at seven saints. Goose island 312 for me and fat tire for my spouse.We started our dinner off with fried cheese curds. The cheese curds were golden brown and not greasy,they come highly recommended!We each ordered 2 sliders and a side of waffle fries. I had Asian and smoked BBQ slider and Doug ordered BBQ and California turkey slider. All were cooked to perfection and delicious . They have several options when it comes to the menu so I feel there is something for everyone. All in all we had a wonderful dining experience and our waitress( once we got one) was on the ball and friendly. We will be returning and I would recommend Seven Saints to our friends.",

Also, I really love the rib eye steak sandwich, its pricey ($10), but its amazing and it comes with a side (onion rings are killers in here).There is also the possibility of ordering combos with salad, soup, etc... I never had that, but I heard its pretty good.Bottom line: this place is a MUST in Champaign. During weekend it might get crowded and with a waiting line, usually I go by myself, so I never had that problem.",

Same goes for their pretzel.  They give a tiny portion of jalapeo cheese and some mustard.  We didn't like the mustard, so we asked for a little more cheese...that was an extra $0.50.  The money isn't a big deal, but it is annoying to find these little charges on the final bill when we were gonna just tip more anyways.  After several dinners here, it just seems like a customer service isn't a huge priority.",

This would be okay if they hadn't hidden the drafts behind columns such that it's impossible to discover what types of beer they have.The food menu was more promising.  It's split into two parts:  half the items were ripped off from Crane Alley (beet chips with goat cheese, sweet potato fries, cajun crab cake) and the other half are \"sliders\".  Upscale White Castle.Frankly, the food wasn't particularly bad.  My friend enjoyed his salad.  But it wasn't particularly good either:  his slider was only so-so and my sandwich was like a salt lick.  But I probably would have gone back just to break up the monotony of eating downtown if the service hadn't sucked.When our waitress finally got around to us, I ordered a sandwich.  She came back five minutes later to tell me that there had been a \"permanent substitution\" with that item.  By substitution, she meant that it was nothing at all like the description - perhaps it still had the same kind of bread.When I told her I didn't want this new sandwich, she made a big deal out of me being \"too picky,\" and telling me that the kitchen was now going to be mad at her.\"Permanent substitution\"?  Seriously, print new menus and lose the attitude.",

I got a tuna salad sandwich with cheese melted onto one of the pieces of bread. Not much tuna melt action. Eye of the beholder though, I get that.

Fried mushrooms, cheese curds, onion rings--they're all good and don't make you feel gross afterwards like some other places do.The salads are big and hearty. Sliders offer lots of options. And their menu allows you to mix and match things to meet your taste. Personally I like the red pepper gouda soup when they have it and the southwest chipotle chicken salad.

What follows is my progression.My first visit was mostly about the drinks.  I found the beer menu to be decent (which is what I felt like drinking that night).  I know I ordered food and I was not displeased with it.  Overall, my first experience was good and I came back for more.  My next visit included food and drinks.  I went with some sort of mixed drink that tasted fine but was not memorable.  I had the salmon slider to eat.  I did not notice if the menu listed what came with the slider or not, and the waitress did not bother to mention that the slider come with just the sandwich.  When I got my slider I realized that one mini sized salmon sandwich was not going to be enough for dinner.  Sadly, I started eating the slider before I ordered more food.  I can only describe it as a salty salmon puck.  After that, I was no longer hungry, and we went elsewhere.I returned for lunch, and had the BLT salad with the tomato soup.  I recommend both options.  The soup was so good that I came back for lunch again and paired it with the tomato pesto grilled cheese.  This was also wonderful.  In fact it was so good that I found myself craving the soup and grilled cheese one day so I went for lunch.  Now, I am not a fan of swiss cheese which is one of the cheeses in the sandwich.  I requested that the swiss cheese be replaced with provolone instead.  When I got my sandwich there was no swiss cheese, but there was no other cheese on the sandwich.  There should have been American cheese as well.  I guess the server misunderstood my request, and I figured it was an honest mistake so I didn't think it was a big deal.The last straw was yesterday.  I went for lunch again and ordered the tomato pesto grilled cheese with the tomato soup.  Again I requested that the swiss be replaced with provolone.  When I got my sandwich it was more like toast than a grilled cheese.  There was one slice of American cheese and one slice of provolone cheese on each piece of bread, but the cheese was not melty and gooey.  It was toasted and crispy.  Then the pesto was glopped on in one cold dollop.  I found the sandwich to be dry. From now on I will probably only go to this place for the drinks.  Too bad I can find drinks at just about any bar in town.  I feel let down because I really wanted to like this place.  I love the look and feel of the bar, and it has all the potential to be great.  However, if they can't even accomplish a grilled cheese sandwich why would you want to eat their food?",

This Chicago girl says yes, please.  2.  Tasty food.  I had the slider/salad/sweet potato fries combo, and everything was really good.  They're known for their sliders, apparently.3.  Great vibe.  We didn't feel rushed here.  Didn't feel pressured to drink more, and they didn't blink when our party size doubled and we moved to a different table.  Cons:1.  Small-ish portions:  At $10 for the above-mentioned meal, I felt a little.....unsatisfied.  The sliders seem pricey at  $3+ a pop, too.  2.  Service:  A bit slow.  It picked up when we started strictly drinking, but there was nary a condiment to be found during our meal.  All in all, I'd head back.  It's a nice joint in downtown Champaign.",

The steak in it was so chewy.  I took it off the salad but then the salad was still warm.  It had grilled onions and mushrooms on it which I find odd.  I think it's weird to have grilled onions in a salad.  Maybe it's me but it's just not right.The mushroom sandwich was soggy and not very good.  Actually the mushrooms were just fine but putting it together in a sandwich with cheese and red peppers just didn't do it for me.  They do not go together in my opinion. Basically, I found both items odd.The server was great and the food came out fast I will give them credit for that.  I have been here a few times and this is not a place that I would volunteer up if someone was asking for suggestions where to eat.Some people love it and some people don't.",

Other than that, they have a great beer selection, the cheese plate is absolutely delicious (whatever they do to the bread to soften it up is a masterpiece of appetizer prep, plus each type of cheese on the plate is very tasty) and they play some damn good music. On a Saturday night on the outdoor patio I heard them play The Avalanches, Rob Dougan, Gorillaz, Lindsey Stirling and many more amazing artists that just happen to be in my favorite genre. I don't know if it was a streaming service or a custom playlist but they should continue with it. The wait staff are cute, and they do a good job. I really like Seven Saints.",

I almost expect to get attitude from a server if a two-top asks for separate checks.  It took her awhile to sort everything out, but hey, she asked for it.

Ordered the Cheese Curds as an appetizer, my gf ordered the Tomato Pesto Grilled Cheese and I had the Ribeye Steak sandwich.  We both had two drinks with our dinner...Cheese curds came before the meal and they turned out to be pretty good.  Nothing to rave about, but average.  At last, our meal was delivered.  The bun for my Ribeye sandwich turned out to be what looked like Texas toast.  As I peeled back the bread to look at my sandwich, I was in for a huge let down!  This was the absolute worst excuse for a ribeye steak sandwich.  My biggest complaint, it was paper thin!  PAPER THIN!!!  Literately speaking, my steak was no thicker than a cardboard coaster.  The price tag on this steak sandwich was $10.  This is my biggest pet peeves when it comes to steak sandwiches...I don't mind paying upwards of $15 for a steak sandwich, but I expect good quality!   This was such a poor excuse for ribeye, I had to eat it with the top piece of toast off, just to taste the meat.  How dare they insult their customers with such a poor excuse for a steak sandwich!  My gf equally hated her grilled cheese for reasons she will explain in her own review.Once the check arrived, ($52) we asked to speak with the manager.  We both expressed our concerns with Andy, the manager.  We felt like after spending $50, we should leave the restaurant full and satisfied.  Instead, we were leaving hungry, miserable, and downright insulted!  Andy rattled off various reason as to why my steak might have been a little on the thin side.  He apologized for the size of the steak, and offered us 2 free drinks to make up for our poor experience.  REALLY???  We spent over $50 and all he was going to do was give us two free drinks?  No thanks!  We refused the free drinks, and made sure he knew he just lost two customers for good.I'm not looking for a handout!  I'm not looking for my money back...but the way he handled our situation was horrible!  If a customer spends $50 in your restaurant and absolutely hated the food, two drinks is not enough to make up for this!  I expected a credit or a gift card to come back and give Seven Saints another chance.  Now, I will never be back!  I can find steak sandwiches comparable to the one I had at Seven Saints at Taffies or Steak n Shake!  Keep your two free drinks!  Just know we will spread the word to anyone who will listen!  I hope you handle future situations better.",

If you don't know what that is, then you have to make sure you check out ALL of the discount alcohol nights at Seven Saints because they are all deals you should take advantage of!The whiskey I got was Snake River Stampede. Mainly because I thought it was funny that it was considered a \"rodeo whiskey\" and also that the description for it said \"this whisky can still kick like a bucking bronco when served neat.\" haha.Another nice thing is that they alcohol menu has two featured House drinks and a description for both. This makes it a bit easier while choosing a drink and you don't have to ask the waitress/waiter about every single drink. Even though my server was nice enough to do it if asked.I got the Triple \"S\" Platter (Slider, 1/2 Salad, and a Side). I got the cheese slider, 1/2 Caesar salad and waffle fries. I liked all the food. Their waffle fries were really good.Up until I tried Seven Saints, I only thought of sliders as the little burgers you get from White Castle, but Seven Saints is now my favorite place to get them. I'll definitely be back soon.",

With plenty of space out and inside, and self-seating, the atmosphere is always semi-casual and always welcoming. After looking at the menu, we expected an average dining experience, based on the fact that the menu accentuates burgers (they call their mini-burgers SLIDERS) and salads...not our usual dining-out fare.However...the wings are the BEST WINGS we have ever had in our lives. They are not your usual buffalo-drowned bits of suspiciously massive chook, these are fine specimens of realistically-sized, expertly-cooked bird, served crispy with your choice of two sauces, (there are lots to choose...from BBQ to Thai Peanut and beyond).In ordering, we found that each ordering the Slider/Salad combo worked really well, although sharing sliders and tasting different flavors also works well. There is an extensive beer/wine selection, including some fashionable Spanish options, however we seriously question a wine list without a single New Zealand option, especially in the Sauvignon Blanc section. Our favorite sliders so far have included the Buffalo Chicken, the BlackJack, the California Turkey and the Salmon, although we highly recommend asking for NO BUTTER on the buns if you are interested in 'eating lightly'. Our two salads (Goat Cheese and Spinach/Fried Chicken Salad) were both surprisingly delicious, after so many below-average iceberg salads in the mid-west.All in all, we think they have found a niche targeting people who appreciate casual dining prepared exceptionally well. This is the PERFECT OPTION for those diners who want a home-town up-scale alternative to Ruby Tuesday, Steak n Shake, Fridays, or perhaps even Guido's at the same price and not at the mall!Expect to spend $30 on food for 2 courses for 2 people.",

I have visited this restaurant twice now, both during the week and on the weekend, and have left feeling very less than satisfied.  The building itself is beautiful, the bar is stunning, the ambiance is lovely, (albeit incredibly loud- so dont go in there expecting to have a conversation with your dinner-mates), but the service is unimpressive.  There are certainly quite a few waiter/waitresses around (enough that i have watched them run into each other) but they never seem to come to my table.  Drinks take too long to be made as well as to reach my table from the bar.  I actually watched my drink sit at the waitress station at the bar with the ice melting in it for a while before it was brought to me.  I had the bavarian pretzels, which were decent by themselves, but the jalepeno sauce served with it was chunky and old, and had thickened to an almost inedible point.   As for the sliders, they were nothing special, and I thought, a bit over-priced for what they were.  I wasnt thrilled about the beef the burgers were made with, and it wasnt seasoned at all.   Absolutely avoid any slider with a Turkey Burger inside, it smelled old and.....stale? rancid? The one shining point of my visits, and the only reason this place gets a second star is because of the cheese curds.  The breading was light and crisp, the cheese had substance, and best of all, they were even delicious re-heated the next day!  The sweet potato chips are also amazing.I want to like this restaurant, but I just cant. This restaurant will never be my suggestion for a C-U dinner option.",

My favorites are the Black Jack slider (pepperjack cheese, grilled onions and ancho aioli topped with fried jalapeos) and the Smokey BBQ slider (cheddar, bbq sauce, fried onion ring).  Good stuff.   The lunch combos are a pretty good deal, which offsets the price issue I mentioned earlier.  I usually get the slider + side + salad combo for lunch (which is about $10), and they have other combinations for that.  I've only had the Caesar salad, and it was fine.  Several of my co-workers have had the salmon slider and said it was good as well.I have tried the crinkle-cut sweet potato fries, which were good but not my personal favorite.  The cheese curds are great (as many others have posted), but you do feel a bit of guilt for eating batter-covered balls of cheese.  It's nearly the epitome of gluttony, and you can feel your arteries harden mid-bite.  We did order the Bavarian Pretzels once also and those were good.Service is usually average, at best, but not worth complaining about much.If it's cold outside, avoid the table near the door!   We went once in February when it was still pretty cold out, and even with a large curtain around the entrance way, we were constantly blasted by cold air when people came in the door.  Even in warm weather it's rather distracting.  We've been seated there twice (maybe it's their only pre-setup table for 8).  I'd recommend asking to sit somewhere away from the door if possible.We'll probably go back.  They have enough variety that it's a nice place to go occasionally.",

It's dark: too dark for any food picture. Feels old/vintage on the inside and has a very cool atmosphere.We started with the Bavarian pretzels and a black & blue salad. The pretzels were really warm and tasty, the salad was also wasn't bad, although kind of skimpy on the ribeye pieces. We each got one of the \"pick X, Y, and Z\" combos. I got an Asian slider with the chicken enchilada soup, and sweet potato fries. It was pretty good, the slider was small, as expected, not quite White Castle size or anything though. I really enjoyed the wasabi flavor of the slaw, but felt it needed more toppings. I did order it with everything on a typical burger (lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle) since the top of the menu said those items were available at your request, but I didn't get any of those items when my food was brought out. I did try my Dad's California turkey slider and thought that was pretty good, too. The soup wasn't bad, although it more resembled a chili in my opinion. Crinkle-cut sweet potato fries were awesome! Seven Saints has an extensive selection of alcohol. I really think they are a bar more so than a restaurant. Lots of exotic, small-batch, local, craft, etc. type liquors, cocktails and beers. I had something called a Dragon's Milk, which was an absolutely delicious stout but pricey at $7.50I forgot our server's name but she did a good job!Overall a little pricey for what it is, but I felt the food was definitely a step up from typical bar/pub food. In my opinion, they should diversify their menu by way of adding some non-sandwich options. I must note that they source most of their meet from Old Time Meat & Deli down the street, which is great, knowing things are a bit more local.I'll be back!",

A fairly interesting building.  Some history there.  But if I wanted history, I'd go downtown Urbana, sit at Blind Pig, or the old newspaper.  Favorites!  Seven Saints, as far as I was always concerned, was god-awful expensive.  And for food you could find pretty much anywhere.  Burgers, fries.  Simple standard sandwiches.  Hit or miss, but I'd say, especially for the money, hit up the diner a few blocks away.  You're going to get a much tastier experience, and service with smile.",

The waitstaff is EXTREMELY knowledgable on different liquors and beer.  They are particularly helpful on whiskey and beer, but more than adequate on just about anything else as well.  The only negative thing I can say is they have changed my thoughts on what to expect out of waitstaff, and I have found many other bars/restaurants lacking.The drink list is huge, and new things are constantly being added.  Its very common for there to be a few \"off the list\" specials, particularly on Wednesday nights.  Wednesdays are a great night to go since 1/4 of the whiskey is half off that night in rotation.  I have tasted a ton of different whiskeys I never would have tried if it wasn't for this night.  The waitstaff is always glad to recommend something new based off your criteria, and I have ended up purchasing several bottles from my home bar after trying them at Seven Saints.The food is good, and always comes out quick.  I am particularly fond of the cheese curds, waffle fries, and sweet potato fries.  Most sandwiches are sliders, so don't expect a large sandwich.  They have a deal where you can split soup, salad, and a slider for a good price, that's normally what I choose.  Their caesar salad is great!",

When we first walked in, I wasn't sure if I was underdressed, was it a dinner only place, the dark lighting, the fancy decorations, I couldn't tell.  But the maitre d' was totally welcoming, and when I asked \"Are you food only or can we get drinks?\" he laughed and said it was no problem, and asked where we wanted to sit. We sat at the bar, and the bartender was very nice and got us our drinks fast.  After we sat down, we realized we should have sat outside because of the beautiful weather, but didn't feel like moving.  I didn't look at the food menu, but a few people I was with ordered food.  Unfortunately, 2 of the 3 orders were wrong.  One friend doesn't red meat, and ordered chicken in her salad, only to bite into a piece of steak.  Another friend said her food was just okay.They had some nice beer choices, and after several years in CA, the prices seemed reasonable.  And actually, I ordered a beer on tap that I didn't end up liking.  The bartender saw that I wasn't drinking it, and asked if I wanted something else.  No problems, no extra charges- it was very considerate.  Granted, I should have asked for a taste before I bought it, but I would have eventually drank it.  It was just an extra bonus that I was able to get something else that I really enjoyed.  Overall, a pleasant experience, and I would recommend it.",

They really know their whiskey so this is a great place to try something new of you have discriminating taste. This is possibly my favorite feature of any bar in the area.They always have a nice selection of beer on tap too (at a nice range of prices) and have recently started \"Brewsdays\" with some nice beer specials.Seven Saints has some quality food too. Sliders, salads, sides, desserts... It's all delicious. Definitely try the sweet potato fries or beet chips. My only complaint about the menu is that, since I tend to order vegetarian, the options can get a little stale (though you can sub in a veggie burger on any of their sliders).My favorite meal? California Turkey Slider (sub a veggie burger, hold the bacon), waffle fries, and the Southwest Chipotle Salad.And last, but not least, the atmosphere: Seven Saints feels classy, but not so classy that you'll feel underdressed if you show up in a t0shirt and jeans. It's a darker feel and the furniture and decorations are detailed and thought-out. Even when it's busy, they bar doesn't get too terribly loud so it's great for a date or a night out with friends if you'd like to be able to have a conversation at the table.",

A bit generic, but comfortable.The bartenders are friendly and on top of things.  A handful of taps, some good micros like Ballast Point and Dogfish Head.  The requisite Macros and a full bar as well.  All things to all people on the booze front.They have a good reuben sandwich, and some specials every once in a while.  The pork tenderloin sandwich was decent, nothing special.  Overall, a nice spot to drink with slightly generic vibe and pub grub.  Not bad as a neighborhood joint, or for a drink after a round of golf.",

The first thing you notice when you step in is the numerous large-screen TVs. There was nothing interesting showing when I came, but I imagine this would be a great place to watch major sports events like NFL games and the NCAA basketball tournament. The restaurant is located within a nice clubhouse, so the place is clean, well-lit, and pretty spacious. In terms of atmosphere and setting, there's nothing to complain about at all.The problems I had were with the food. To start, the water had funny taste to it. Moving on to the nachos, the ratio of ingredients didn't impress me. They overdo the cheese, and skimp on the pico de gallo. The cheese is melted, but the chips are cold. The wings weren't great, being both small and overly fried. But they're just 40 cents each on Sunday so they're still not a bad deal. I wouldn't order these on any other day of the week though. Sandwich wasn't bad, but took a really long time to arrive. We're talking ~45 minutes at 11 AM on a Sunday. For a sandwich and fries.I'll probably go back again to give the place a second chance, but I wouldn't do it without more coupons. My score breakdown looks something like this: 5/5 for the atmosphere, 2/5 for the food, 2/5 for the slow service, 3/5 overall.",

The fries were ho-hum and need to be kicked up a notch somehow.  We will try a different side dish next time around.   The service was outstanding.  Seating was a little too close for my tastes, next time we will request an out of the way table so folks wanting good TV viewing seats aren't crammed in next to us.Cost per person was very reasonable, we WILL be back!",

Good flavor though. Menu is burgers, wraps, salads (like ten different kinds), and grill items. Also have a gluten free menu that is a pick a protein and two veggies for 13.99 (steak salmon or chicken). Had the chicken, not a $14 meal but now I don't feel bad about what I ate. Molly had the chicken cease salad wrap. She took half home and claims it was good. Also got fries. She says they had steak seasoning on them. Service was fast and attentive.

I wanted to try them all!Sweet Moses! The only way they would sell me a sausage is if I paid 8 dollars for a \"meal\" and then they would \"add on\" a sausage for another 3 dollars! I saw massive piles of sausage sitting right behind the woman I was trying to order from. I just wanted a sausage or two and was willing to pay a premium for their sausages. But 8  dollars for one sausage?! Come on. This is a classic rip-off! Taking advantage of a community event to make a few extra bucks? Shame. Even the taste of champaign wasn't this blatant. I hope the organizers of Oktoberfest next year  are more judicious in their choice of vendors.",

You find 15 varieties to choose from sourced from a place in California that's the real deal (continental sausage Glendale CA) and the house made sauerkraut has a sharp vinegar bite, which balanced with the fizzy taste of fermented cabbage and is an awesome complement to the tubes of meat. Served with a German style mustard and German potato salad you have yourself an authentic experience.   At a very reasonable price you can have yourself a great German meal compared with the schlep to Gibson city for the bier stube, which is also amazing but pricey.

They have daily deals on drinks and food, changing every day which is really cool and I would go back for the deals. We went on a Saturday which is when brunch is offered til 3pm. I ordered a Cajun omelet. It had this Mexican appeal to it because I got salsa & sour cream with it. And it had a kick. The omelet was large but thin. Not much to it although it was nice and cheesy and that's always important in omelets for me! The prices are cheap too so it works out.",

Whoa!  Great deal and the food wasn't half bad. So why two stars?  They were understaffed that day. That is something that I understand and can roll with. Not a problem.  It took 10-15 minutes before the server noticed my gesturing. Eventually I placed a dinner order.  I had ordered a beer and 15 minutes later I made mention of it to the server. I just thought she forgot. Her response was completely uncalled for. Harsh tone, reactionary word choice, scowl...  I asked the table if I came off rude or something. No, I was apparently quite nice. Not only did I feel like walking out, everyone at the table was looking around wondering what the heck just happened. Someone a few people down said \"oh, yeah. That's why we never come here.\"  We were a polite, hungry, and thirsty group with ages ranging between 20-60.  The staff made us feel like an intrusion as my simple question wasn't the only time we were snapped at and dumbfounded by our treatment. The tip was added into the bill. I still gave her a dollar on top of the included gratuity.  She ended up with a 30% tip from me. That is likely the only time I step foot in that place. I was treated like an inconvenience. Trash.  I would have ordered a few more beers. I stopped at one because of the ridiculousness. Food, drink, and price was great. The staff is the worst. The.  Worst.",

I had been initially impressed by the renovation of the building, it looked quite nice inside. However, it  soon became clear that the staff was very very poorly trained. The waitress, though terribly sweet seemed lost in the menu. It took ages for the first wave of food to arrive at the table, and the kitchen sent out one entree ten minutes before the rest. Forcing one friend to either eat cold food, or eat before the rest of us.When the bulk of the food did finally arrive,  it turned out that the kitchen had forgotten to prepare two of the entrees. The traumatized seeming waitress apologized and scurried off to try and get the kitchen to prepare the rest of the food.  Flash forward twenty minutes later, and she brings *one* more entree to my friend and says \"OK! Have a nice meal\"  It was at this point that we all realized that she has no idea that I had also still not received my meal.  She acted surprised, and then tried to act as if I hadn't actually ordered anything. Then when she reviewed her ticket she came to the realization that she had simply forgotten mine altogether. At this point, everyone else was finished with their food, and I was starving and exceedingly cranky.  She went back to the kitchen (Which is exposed to the dining area so everything they are doing at the food window can be seen. Especially when they are dramatically talking about a table that they are unhappy with) and waved her arms about angrily to the female manager in the pink sweater. About ten minute later the waitress finally produced my tepid food, slapped hastily onto a plate. Starving, I didn't bother to point out that they had not included one of my sides, but did ask to speak to the manager. This manager was in no way shape or form prepared to handle an upset customer. She arrived at the table combative and rude. The way to handle a customer who is rightfully upset with their treatment is not to then embarrass them for complaining and still not comp their meal or even bother to offer any sort of *genuine* apology.  Pink sweater manager on duty. Please report to corporate for proper training on how to both run your restaurant, and deal with the unhappy patrons you have tortured.I paid for my meal, and tipped the waitress twenty percent, as it was not her fault that the manager had not correctly trained her. However, I would suggest avoiding this location at all cost until it  receives further training intervention on the management level from corporate. Had the manager been polite, and handled the situation properly, this review would have been unnecessary.",

They have too big of a bar area and never enough servers /bartenders.  You can go neglected at the bar for quite a while.  The food is mediocre. I was hungry after a long day of travel,  so I ordered the Jack Daniel's steak with lobster tail.  The steak was cooked well and tasted ok,  but would not recommend the Jack Daniel's sirloin.  Is only cooked with that BBQ sauce and some on the side.  It's not worth the extra price.  Get the regular sirloin and maybe ask if you can get that BBQ sauce on the side.  Also,  do not get the lobster tail.  It was ridiculously small.  It had two bites of meat in it and they didn't even serve with melted butter.  NOT WORTH IT. The macaroni and cheese was pretty good and works for a side.  The \"fresh\" broccoli was fresh out of the refrigerator.  It was still cold,  not cooked well.",

We told them we'd take any table, even in the bar area.  We were seated at a bar table in about 25 minutes.  Our waiter was very nice but not very organized.  It took over 10 minutes to get our drink order and another 10 minutes after that for him to take our food order.  One of the drinks had a long black hair in the glass so we had to send back.  Gross.  Our food came fairly quickly, however we were missing part of one order.  We notified the waiter and also asked for more napkins.  Neither the rest of the order nor napkins ever came.  There's no excuse for that.   The waiter also never came back after that to check on us. This was not a good experience and I probably won't go back.  I had high hopes when it was opened but sadly does not live up to expectations.",

It's not a bad restaurant/bar, it's just uninspired. I will say that this TGI Friday's makes very good drinks. My sister orders some sort of Grey Goose peach cocktail and it's always tasty. The food is again not amazing and usually overpriced for what is essentially meat and potatoes. Even as I type this I added a star for the drinks and the nice servers. I have a thing about people bothering me just enough as I eat and TGI Friday's has it down. Enjoy that extra star, guys.",

The food was really great the first time. The service was really great this time. The manager immediately took care of a minor glitch on our latest visit. I have to hand it to them. They really have moved past the era of the red and white stripes, ugly suspenders, and over the top buttons Their menu is better than it has ever been. All six people in my household want to go here, and that's saying something. I might even make it a threepeat this month.

This chain was not a place that I personally picked myself, but I would go if other people suggested it.  Me thinks not anymore.  They just got put on my list of NOTs, along with Cracker Barrel and Texas Roadhouse.  True, at least TGI Friday's DOES share their nutritional information.  It's just that it's ALL too high in calories (YES, even the salads!).  And seriously, if I wanted to eat a salad, I'd stay at home and make my own!",

We arrived at 10pm and upon our arrival there was NO one at the hostess station; however, a small group of waitstaff and the hostess were gathered at a table directly adjacent to the hostess station.  We stood there looking at them looking at us like \"why are yall here???\" I immediately thought to myself \"damn are they closing?\"  So I looked at the door to check the closing time, which was posted as 1AM!!! After saying Helllllo to them, a young lady then scurried over to seat us.  Not a whole lot of people were there (weather was awful that day) and again the waitstaff were just sitting around. NOT good.  A young lady finally came over to take our order for drinks and kinda just hung around looking at us.  I thought this was soo friggin wierd! We then proceeded to order an appetizer of the spinich and artichoke dip, when it came, the chips were burnt and hard as a brick! I immediately sent that crap back! We get those back with fresh(er) chips but I still wasn't impressed by those.Our entress came and were \"alright\".My biggest complaint was about the waitstaff! (They were just sitting around looking at people like why are any of you here)! LOL  It's my assumption that the management had gone home for the day and they all just kicked back! This place had better get there service together and QUICK! This place is nothing like the old location, which was always a good experience.

At the old one I would have to yell in order to be heard.  it is all open and looks nothing like the Chevy's that used to be here.We ordered appetizers.  Some kind of chicken Asian skewers and loaded potato chips.  I loved the skewers.  They were made with cilantro and I love cilantro.  The Asian Cole slaw that came with the skewers was really good too. The loaded potatoes were OK.  My friend liked them.

But this review is based on more recent visits. :-)It can get busy on Sundays after churches typically get out. But, for the most part, there is not a long wait. One one recent occasion I had brunch with my mom and a family friend. I ordered a salad. It was HUGE. I actually had to take half of it to go! On the second recent trip, we went out as a family for Mother's Day. No wait late in the afternoon. I ordered the banana blueberry pancakes. They were supposed to be multigrain, but learned that they had discontinued the multigrain batter the week before. :-(  But the waitress said that they could make them with regular batter. I was surprosed that the bananas were not baked in the pancake, rather they were sliced on top. Regardless, the pancakes were still good. They have sugar free syrup if that is your preference and it wasn't bad. They let me alter my order no problem. It was supposed to come with turkey sausage and egg whites. But I changed it to fruit and bacon. No extra charge.Speed of service and attentiveness dependent upon who you get and the time of day. But I haven't had a negative experience. Pay your tab at the front register, not at the table.",

My boyfriend and I miss the banana cream pie we used to pick up from Marie calendars in California and hoped this would be a similar substitute. The lady that rung me up was so friendly and reassured me the pie would be great. It turns out we had a hit item at the picnic we went to. Everyone kept talking about the pie as we were making our way through the savory main dishes. And boy did it disappear fast. The pie was just as delicious as Marie's. Still skeptical on dining in though...",

They serve \"mammoth muffins\" for around $2.30.  They had the typical kinds like Banana Nut, but also Cranberry Nut and Carrot, which I really wanted to try but I couldn't imagine that cream cheese frosting sitting too well at 8am.  Another time.Their muffins are big... I guess \"mammoth\" sized, but instead of an insanely gigantic muffin all I can picture is an adorable woolly mammoth.  Anyways, I thought the muffin was cream-filled, but it came with a mini scoop of butter on the side.  Not the same, and I didn't slab it on.  It tasted great the way it was.  With a cup of coffee my breakfast was within $5.By the way their pies and cookies are amazing, especially their FRENCH SILK pie.  All I've had here are their desserts and that is fine by me!",

Not downright bad, definitely not particularly good.I got an omelet with pepper jack cheese and the \"garden mix\" (green peppers, onions, and celery).  It came with homefries and 3 pancakes.  All for just under $9.  Not a bad price considering the ridiculous amount of food you get, but I don't really NEED that much food, and it wasn't very good food.The pancakes were pretty good; I had them with the wild berry sauce, since I can't stand that fake \"maple\" syrup that restaurants serve--so kudos to them for offering 3 different syrup choices for pancakes (maple syrup, wild berry syrup, and peach syrup).  The hashbrowns were also decent.  My omelet was pretty nasty and I ended up just eating half of it.  The pepper jack cheese tasted cheap and bland and the peppers onions and celery (....still a bit baffled by the inclusion of celery) was just not a great combo.  Kind of annoyed that cheese counts toward one of the \"free\" toppings in the \"create your own omelet\"...shouldn't an omelet just...COME with cheese?I had a few sips of my boyfriend's coffee and it tasted pretty good.Service was average, and we got our food fairly quickly.The bill for the 2 of us came to about $22 (before tip).  We spent a couple bucks less at Courier Cafe last weekend, for better food and a more interesting atmosphere.  Definitely will be going back to Courier Cafe, not so sure about Perkins.",

The food was good and hit the spot. The problems came after we got our food. Our waitress disappeared. I'm not sure if she was taking a break or busy doing other tasks but she was nowhere to be found. We were wanting to order dessert which is one of the perks of going to Perkins as they have good pie and other goodies. Unfortunately we have had this type of service in the past. We did inform the manager about our disappearing waitress.Another problem I have with the staff is that if you order a muffin with your meal, don't expect to get dessert. The waiter/waitress will suggest that you 'probably don't want dessert' since you had a muffin. This has happened to us on multiple visits from multiple waitresses. I'm not sure if this is how they train their staff here, but it's really not a good way to run a business. I want to give them my money for more food and tip well, but they make it very difficult to do this.I don't care if you have the best food on the planet. If your service is lousy, then it ruins the whole experience.",

I've experienced better\" and three stars jumps to \"A-OK.\"  Perkins is somewhere in between.  The menu for breakfast seems pretty extensive.  I ordered a platter that included smoked sausage (greasy), sausage (greasy and bland), eggs (done okay), bacon (spot on), breakfast potatoes (pretty good), and pancakes (so-so).  I like that they leave a pot of coffee on the table, rather than having you wait for refills from the wait staff.  It would have been even better if the pot was full and the coffee was good, neither of which was the case.  My waitress was efficient and personable.  Seemed more like a pro waitress rather than some of these student types that serve with the attitude that says, \"I'm only doing this until I graduate and start my money-making career, so don't expect much.\"  Again, not all student wait staff are like that but some are.  The place seemed clean and it wasn't very busy for a Saturday morning breakfast.  I've wanted to try Perkins and must admit i went there today only because Courier Cafe was closed.  I will return to Perkins, as there were some other things on the menu I'd like to try and because the experience wasn't completely a bust.  Although, I am usually a member of the Clean Plate Club, I did leave behind one piece of smoked sausage, a sausage link, some potatoes, and half the pancakes.  That says something.SECOND VISIT: My first reaction holds true the second time.  The coffee wasn't very good.  The eggs were okay and the potatoes decent.  Bacon once again was perfect.  The muffin french toast was awful. and was left unfinished.",

I tried one of their newer omelets, and it was surprisingly tasty.  I had that problem where I was too full to eat more but wanted to keep eating...  The service, however, leaves much to be desired.The first time I went was on a Sunday around noon, so it was pretty busy.  My boyfriend and I stood in front of the podium waiting for someone to come to put our names on the list.  When someone finally came, he first took the name of someone who had come in after us, like we weren't even there.  It took a while to be seated, but that's understandable since it was about time for Sunday brunch.The second time was again on a Sunday around noon, but it wasn't near as busy.  Our waitress took our orders promptly, but afterwards, the quality of service plummeted.  My water glass was empty for at least 15 minutes before getting a refill, twice.  The waitress had walked past our table many times, but didn't even look at us to see how we were doing.  Our food took forever to come, and I understand there were five of us so that can take a while, but this was ridiculous.  And the waitress didn't say a thing the whole time.  When the food did come, it was warm, so at least the meal itself was good.  I asked for a box, but it never came.  I ended up asking for one at the counter myself to avoid waiting probably another half hour.  Overall, our waitress stopped at our table maybe five times total, and never apologized for the long wait or even noticed that we were pretty upset with our service.  In addition, several of the other employees were arguing loudly in earshot of customers, which I think is pretty unprofessional.I can't say I'd recommend going here, and if you do, expect to wait.",

The service staff showed little effort. After my waitress carelessly placed the water on my table, she just threw my straw in front of me and hurriedly proceeded to serve the neighboring table. Wow. What's more is that my wedge salad was hastily assembled--the iceberg lettuce was stacked in chunks and the bleu cheese was piled on one side. 3. The booth I sat at was not well-cleaned, and the table was sticky. How the heck this happened is beyond me.The only thing holding me back from giving them 1 star is that their pastries at the front counter look well made. Sorry, Perkins.

When the ice had brought down all the electrical, once, and the roads were sheets of ice, a death-defying trek to Perkins, who promptly saved Christmas, one year!Whenever we couldn't make up our mind about anywhere else, the answer was always Perkins, and this location (on University) always met the call.  A warm pancake stack, with an ice cream scoop sized wad of butter melting in!  The aforementioned French Silk pie, a slice of it just as a treat.  Even their hot turkey plate-- a real Butterball turkey, slow cooked, with amazing \"fixin's\".

The restaurant is a little dated, now, but you just _can't_ judge this book by its cover.

I'd give the place another chance though, only because it was good food and the wait may have just been a fluke.",

I asked her if I ordered combo and she said yes. I didn't say anything back, but this is really unexpected. When I asked if I ordered a combo, I simply imply that I didn't.

They literally slapped everything together and had the burger leaning one way and the topping leaning another way. the fries were disappointing. When I think of cajun fries I think of delicious thick-cut, crispy fries. Jurassic Grill's cajun fries were  flat, lifeless fries topped the cheapest packet of cajun seasoning they could find. I didn't eat my fries, and I'm not a very picky eater. Some of their burgers come in the \"T-rex\" version, which will get you an extra patty for a dollar. You get to choose from a good number of basic \"Free Toppings\". It would be nice to have a selection of premium toppings like avocado, portabello mushrooms, bleu cheese, etc. Also, they have a cool theme, so it's beyond me why they don't use it to expand their small menu. They could have a burger topped with guacamole, lettuce, red onion, and pepper jack and call it some like the Guaca-saurus Burger. Their menu places so much info on their free toppings, but ketchup, mustard, onions, etc is not unique enough to keep me coming back to this place for an ok tasting burger.A lot of untapped potential at this restaurant.",

Every time I've been here the burgers are cooked fresh right before your eyes and the toppings are displayed in a refirgerator in plain sight. There is none of the behind the scenes burger building like you'll find at other places. Price wise Jurassic Grill is comparable to 5 guys or meatheads. The only problems are the lack of seating and the strange hours. Even considering these, Jurassic Grill deserves a five star rating, and then some. When you stop by be sure to say hi to the owner and chat with him a bit if it isn't too busy. The times I've been there he was working the register which shows his dedication. Jurassic Grill is a must-visit for any burger lover, on campus or not.",

The burgers are good; but when there's just one thing on the menu I expect it to be fabulous, not just an Applebee's-style hamburger. Limited seating and no ambiance just makes it seem like a doomed business. There's nothing \"Jurassic\" about it, and even something to pull the theme into the actual restaurant (big portion sizes, Sauron-shaped fries, ANYTHING!) would help; but it just seems gimmicky. Went once to see what it was about, but there are infinitely better dining options nearby.",

Perfect opportunity!Walked into the store and checked out the menu, which is very straightforward and pretty consolidated. I got a T-Rex bacon cheeseburger with a bunch of my favorite toppings, for a little over $5, which, for the size, and amount of calories, was a steal. The burger was tasty! Nicely put together and blended well with the fresh-tasting ingredients. Didn't get any fries or anything with it. If you're looking for a big, greasy mouthful of 'Merica, this it in all its glory.Overall it's a solid fast burger place, perhaps expensive without the Hooked deal, but I wouldn't quite say the best burger in C-U, either. In my opinion Farren's probably takes that cake.",

I'm assuming they are waiting to see how successful the business is prior to investing in decor, not really a big deal at all, just a little disappointing.The Bad:-A serious lack of seating! There are literally eight seats in the entire place! I'm guessing that this is again an issue of waiting to see before investing too much in decor, but there's at least room for one more table.Overall:Definitely worth checking out!

Venue used to be a hookah bar, and it hasn't been updated much since. In the front area they still have large booths utilized for hookah smoking.  Went in on a Tuesday night. Had about 5 people sitting outside, 10 in the back karaoke / dance floor area, and another 15 or so lingering around the bar. The space felt really big for the crowd size. Bartender was prompt and friendly. Limited beers on tap selection (I think I saw 2-3 taps). The patio seemed like it could be a really fun spot. I'd be open to going back and try to catch it at an earlier time to see what the crowd would be like.",

                "review": "Clark Bar is a casual, neighborhood bar.  Don't expect much of a college scene here.  And because the bar is off the main strip for downtown Champaign, you won't find the modern urban socialite scene, either.  Most nights are relatively low-key, though they do host live music from time to time.   The place is deceptively large as rooms are sectioned off to allow for cozy, private settings for small groups.  I love to sit in their patio area in the summer, which also has a layout that allows for some privacy among groups, including a small screened porch (for people who fear insects).The alcohol selection here is probably not indie rock enough to impress beer elitists.  They offer standard beers and well drinks, but there are no obscure microbrews.For some confusing reason, Clark Bar is listed as a \"tapas bar\" on Yelp.  I think that this classification is somewhat misleading as tapas evoke a distinctly trendy, European sensibility.  While the tone of the food verges into tapas territory at times, the ambiance at Clark Bar probably wouldn't be suitable for an elegant dinner date.  The menu ranges from standard fare (burger and fries) to surprisingly exotic.  My carnivorous friends rave about the ribs, which are served exclusively on Wednesday and Friday.  Once I stopped by and found fried ALLIGATOR on the menu, an exceedingly rare delicacy outside of the deep south (ESPECIALLY in Champaign, IL).  Any appetizer they make with shrimp is absolutely perfect.  As a fair warning, some dishes are only offered seasonally.The variation you see in terms of food might also apply to the clientele you meet here.  Most nights the bars is populated by absolutely ordinary local people.  However, during one surreal visit, I watched as a stream of people dressed in Victorian hoop skirts and silk waistcoats marched in.  Not an experience you'd run across at most bars.  Apparently Clark Bar was hosting a meeting of the local steam punk club that evening.I'd recommend Clark Bar for anyone who isn't scared of a bar with a \"townie\" vibe.  This unassuming establishment serves some of the most interesting food in town, depending on the cook's mood.  For those who love to people-watch, there are fewer prime locations in the area.",

Clark Bar is truly one of those places. The building itself is sort of hidden from the rest of the downtown bar scene. The building is actually a Victorian-styled house that was remodeled into a bar. I can't really speak about the drink selections... I'm a simple beer and whiskey man. The domestic drafts are $1 on Thursdays, but might actually the special every day. The bartender was friendly and attentive.",

There are a ton of rooms, a kind of living-room type space with couches for relaxed conversation and live music, a somewhat crowded and annoyingly narrow bar area for boozing it up, and a music room with a stage and some peripheral seating for karaoke, music and dancing.Great prices for beer ($3 Blue Moon!), clean bathrooms, and a great time for my first karaoke experience!

Don't expect anything very healthy here..there are a few salads and a veggie wrap, but all have cheese or dressing (which I guess you could get on the side...).  Onion rings are good, I've heard the mac-n-cheese is tasty, and many of the burgers are on wonderful pretzel rolls.  As a note, they have something called \"haus sauce\", which is just their buffalo sauce, so don't be fooled.  Never been here during peak evening hours, so I can't comment on that, but an ok place for lunch and a beer.",

I felt kind of bad because I was already in a very committed relationship aka married. But really, I wasn't sending misleading creepy signals or being charming either. For the longest time I thought it was the smell of my hair wax I was using to style my bed hair when I would go out to socialize with friends. But I tested this theory numerous times in other cities and no dice. Yes, the wife was not with me at other venues.Investigatively (not a real word)... I think on certain weekends, the local gals come here to find their knight and shining armor to take them away from the small town. But here is the thing, u will never know if she is a local until she tells you. But I came here enough to observe and identify how to spot these rare and undiscovered people. First off, they are extremely beautiful, like the tone of their skin was almost natural and organic... unmanipulated by the city or fake UV rays. They dress differently, no labels and no blig. And here is the kicker, they talk differently. Their topics of discussion are not layered from the dry vocabulary of the bullshit literary material University students are being brain washed in (this includes myself). One big clue seemed to be the type of questions they asked. University girls typically asked questions like what are you studying, where have you interned, what year in school are you? But I noticed the local asked a key differentiating question: where are you originally from?---if you decode this question, it's underlying motive is can you take her away from her boring hometown.Keep in mind, this place is not swarming with these type of treasures. A treasure is a treasure to be found. I write this review because I hope to read or hear about somebody finding their future other half at Firehaus. A smart city kid that swoops a small town gal off her feet and make a ton of babies after graduating.So best wishes to you bachelors, go to Firehaus with new purpose. Cheers! I'll be expecting a wedding invitation shortly. LOL...",

Now what really attracted me today was it's deal! For $4.99 you can get 10 delicious wings that matches that if Buffalo Wild Wings! Of course, the deals do Cary day to day so you may just have to swing by the place very now and them to see if the daily special flows your boat. But when it does, boy is it worth it!The waitresses are extremely fast to react and the food also comes with speed. Their bottles and draft selection are humongous, and their prices are pretty decent too! Definitely checkout the place!",

Based purely on food alone - I give this place 3-stars - it's average. However, it deserves an extra star for its service.

Luckily we stumbled around and found this place open for dinner. Most of the students had gone home for the holidays so it was a perfect fit as this is not really a \"family restaurant\" but a bar with bar food. We ordered the cheese curds which for 5.99 was very little cheese curds and not really that good. They taste like they came from the freezer. The royale burger was a lot burger with double meat patty topped with egg, cheese, bacon, and a pretzel roll. It is definitely not a steak house burger but it was juicy and with good meat flavors. Overall it was good, but not very memorable. The one major plus is if you drink they have quite an extensive bar menu with daily drink specials.Pros: daily drink specials, lots of bar foodCons: the food is okay, I can't say that it is the best bar food I have ever had.

In our time at the Firehaus, we observed an incompetent management team. While the bartenders became busy trying to fill orders for their servers you could see patrons at the bar with empty glasses including ourselves.  Management was sitting at the end of the bar sipping on their sodas and barking orders at employees. At no time did the manager  attempt to help the bartenders and clear their backlog. As we were getting ready to leave we observed a member of the management team chewing out a member of the waitstaff to where she was in tears. This was done in front of a very crowded bar for all patrons to observe. Personally, I think this is a horrible time (middle of a shift) and place (in front of a crowded bar) for a reprimand to occur.   I think their management team is extremely unprofessional and feel for the employees under their leadership.",

We were directed to the FireHaus by quite a few people and were really excited. First I will say our bartender/waitress was amazing and super sweet. Very attentive to us and made sure we got drinks and everything was accurate and super good. The downside is that we put in one appetizer, the pretzel bites.... and then 10 minutes later put in 2 other appetizers and out second order came out first. While we waited we were told multiple times that the kitchen staff misplaced the order and or it got put under another person's order. It took us almost an hour to get pretzel bites, a little crazy. Also we were stuck watching a 21-0 blowout game on one TV while an amazing game (not shown on any TVs) was on. We asked that they change the blowout game and the first guy we asked gave us an answer that screamed \"I don't care enough to make the change for you\". Super disappointing. All in all if/when I get back to Champaign for another game, I will not even have this place on my radar of places to stop at.",

I think that you're tolerable on Mondays, when I can kind of hear myself think, the bartenders are the new ones and not completely jaded, and I can drink cuervo silver margaritas for $3.But Firehaus, my experience with you is generally bad.  The lines are ridiculous, the music is overwhelmingly loud, my friend's credit card got closed out to the wrong person, and had someone else's drinks on it... and his last name is not \"Smith\" or \"Jones\" or anything common.  What You did to get on my last nerve?  Once I was there, and a seasoned bartender dipped a glass in the ice bin, and it came up broken.... which means there was glass in the ice bin.  I pointed it out, and so he got another glass... and dipped it back in the same ice bin with glass in it. Gross.  Their food is OK, but overrated. Bah. Firehaus, I will definitely not miss you when I move away.",

The food is better than most other places on campus as far as bar and grill is concerned. Their best options are half priced wings on Sundays/Mondays, the Hazmat or FDNY wrap (1/2 priced on Saturdays), and their chili. Some things to note are that the waiting staff is usually new during the summer and leading into the fall. Give them some time to learn and adjust to the bar. It can be easy to get aggravated if you're there with a huge group drinking but everyone wants separate checks and the waiter mixes up drinks. Also, the appetizers aren't really worth it omitting the Firehaus fries. Most portions are simply to small for the list price. Side note: When the upstairs bar is open it really opens up the establishment. There is a second story outside deck as well as an outside alleyway (paved and meant to serve as a patio) to sit and dine outside.",

I've been there a few times earlier in the week when it's less crowded, and it's been pretty enjoyable.Last word of advice:  avoid the amaretto stone sours.

I'd eat here probably once a week if not more and switch off between wings, salad, chicken tenders, or spinach artichoke dip. It was all amazing, every time.But sadly, my old stomping grounds have become disappointing.I came here back in May for a random visit and saw they added an AMAZING sandwich to the menu, the Southwest Chicken. Grilled chicken, provolone, pepper and onions, and avocado? YUM. Paired with onion rings and I knew this would be my new go-to on their menu.Flash forward to a couple weeks ago when I came down for Homecoming. My friends and I literally parked the car in a garage a block away and went straight to Firehaus. Ah, the nostalgia! The memories! THE GOOD FOOD!I ordered the Southwest Chicken with a side of onion rings, like I had been dreaming about all day. When it came out I was immediately disappointed to see they had replaced the fresh avocado slices with some sort of avocado PASTE. Yuck! It smelled and tasted bizarre so I scraped it off. Bye, delicious chicken sandwich! Now you are merely of slightly-above-average taste.The next day I came in for lunch, because who actually goes to Illini football games anymore? I decided to get a side salad and wings, and everyone at the table ordered a drink with their food. The waitress brought out everyone's drinks except mine, which I found strange since I had just ordered a bottle of Bud Light Platinum. After another server brought out everyone's food and not mine, I flagged down our server and the look on her face when I asked about my food was one of, \"Oh shit.\" So she ran away and came back a couple minutes later explaining she forgot to put in my order originally. Well, duh, I kind of got that. She apologized profusely and said I'd get a discount on my bill.The wings were worth the wait, honestly, and the salad was as good as I remembered. But then the part where my bill came? No discount. At this point we were rushing off to go to another bar and my friend was nice enough to just pay for my tab, but come on. If you're going to screw up my order and then promise a discount, deliver on it.Maybe I'm just picky, or maybe I expected more from a place I used to frequent. Or maybe it lost its shine. It pains me, Firehaus, but you only get 3 stars from me.",

The Backdraft is a quarter-pound of ground chuck, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and onion. I opted to add bacon to my burger and top it with BBQ sauce. I also subbed the house bun for a pretzel bun to kick this burger up a notch. The result is a mouthwatering combination of sauce, meat, cheese, and bun that is first-rate. If the beef was only a little more flavorful and juicy this campustown burger would be amongst some of the better I've had. Firehaus gets major points for being a campus bar that sports some gourmet grub, great drinks, and a fun atmosphere. If you're ever in home of the Illini Firehaus is a must.",

Honestly, what is the point of maintaining the line that close to closing when the bar itself is not at capacity??Evening:We came here at the end of Fall semester as an organization to celebrate a job well done. Our group of 10 was seated promptly and the waitress did an awesome job in accommodating our group. We came on a Thursday I think which meant $3 burger with AMAZINGGGGGG fries. Their fries are double fried so they have a great crispy crust. On top of that, they have a good selection of beer on tap to complement your meal. Expect to pay more for a pint than for your entire meal haha.So it's quite bittersweet... awesome bar food place turned horrible bar at night? This is life :(",

But now, it's kicking ass and taking names and has a whole lot of loyal customers, and for that, I give this bar all sorts of props.Also, I just said \"props.\" Ew.Anyway, the really excellent thing about this bar is that it is CLEAN. Clean clean clean. Even on Unofficial, which is arguably the dirtiest day on campus all year, the bathrooms at Firehaus will be clean. The layout isn't my favorite as there aren't a whole lot of places to sit, but the beer garden is excellent, and the buffalo chicken sandwich (with pasta salad!) was pretty damned good.Of all the Cochrane bars on campus, this one is without a doubt. the best.",

I've always liked Firehaus but it was never one of my haunts.  I like how they have large tables, and how the front is open-air.  They have lots of daily drink specials, and the atmosphere isn't sketchy.  Dim lighting, very red in there.  Well I guess it is a firehouse.  Despite it \"looking\" nicer than some other campus bars (it's really just that it's newer, I'm sure), you are still going to run into some silly silly people.  Last time we were here, a drunk guy was talking to us and wouldn't leave, so we took his flip flops and hid them in the girls bathroom.  So you know, it's not a total class act of a bar, but it's pretty clean and well-maintaned compared to some of the other options.",

My only, minor complaint was the lack of bartenders making waits for drinks very long (sometimes nearing a half hour). If I come back to the Illinois campus, I'll for sure be stopping at Firehaus for a drink to start the night.",

Either that or I was starving - probably the latter. The server was a bit pushy and had an attitude. After we ate, we played a few rounds of pool. At this point I probably would've gave this place 3 stars but it's what happened at the end of the night that completely turned my night sour. As we were leaving, a staff member came and started screaming bloody murder at us. I was stunned and asked my friends what was going on. From how she was acting you would've thought someone had gotten killed. Turns out my friend forgot to pay for pool. She was out her damn mind yelling at us like she was crazy! The way this woman acted was completely rude and unprofessional. There are numerous ways she could've dealt with this situation and the way she chose was completely and utterly unacceptable. Honestly don't know how this place is still in business. Wish I could give this place 0 stars. Yeah, it's THAT bad. I will NOT be coming back!!",

We ordered the Hawaiian although we substituted BBQ sauce for regular pizza tomato sauce.There are fun pool tables and other arcade games. A jukebox for your favorite tunes can be found near the bar, i think.This place seems to be a staple of downtown champaign.",

So my main complaint about the lunch dining experience is sanitation. I ordered the burger the first time and a hot dog the second. I guess some people don't mind having a communal condiments station but I have a problem with this. The fresh produce like pickles, onions, and lettuce are not refrigerated at all at the communal condiments station. I mean at least puts some cold ice under the box of pickles, lettuce, and onions at least! The ketchup bottle and mustard container all looked like it was ready for the dump. The tips were hardened and crustified and it just looked out of date because no one bothered to keep em clean. Stickyness galore. Wash your hands if you still decide to go. Anyway, minus food but fun joint. Proceed with caution cuz after a few beers you might just make a drunk order of food and realize you got yourself into a bigger mess then you had planned.",

On more than one occasion this man acts as if we are in his way rather than welcoming us as guests. Last time we were there he was in a particularly bad mood, being nasty to his fellow workers and acting as if the patrons were in his way. I come to a bar to have a relaxed fun evening, Rich has more than once made the evening very uncomfortable.I have been in the bar when Rich wasn't working, and when he is not there the people behind the bar are relaxed, they smile, and seem to have fun, but when Rich is there everyone is on edge and grumpy. God forbid anyone does anything in his \"territory\", they get a nasty look. This man is more worried about making sure that everything behind the bar is in its place and perfect, than he is about giving good service to his customers, he will walk by an empty glass many times without asking if you need another drink, you have to flag him down.I think he has been there much too long, and has lost the knowledge that the customer comes first.",

Plus, the deals! 18 Asian dumplings for around 5-6 dollars? Delicious black bean burger for about 5 bucks? Gin and tonic (my standard drink) for less than 4 bucks? What is not to love?Add in the great service, the nice sized televisions for sporting events, pool tables that I am dying to try, and quiet music so we can actually talk to each other and hear ourselves think, and I'm still kicking myself for only checking this place out now. Plus free peanuts! I LOVE FREE PEANUTS. Now, granted, this was a rather quiet Thursday, so we'll have to see what happens if/when it gets busy. But so far, all systems go.",

One of the bartenders was my little league baseball coach, then I played on the bars soft ball team.  Even though I have not lived in Chamaign for about 10 years, I can still find people I know, and bartenders that remember me.When I was little I would order kiddy cocktails from the bar, then get change to play on the only pinball machine.  Then stomp on all the peanut shells on the floor.  I have seen expansion many times.  Originally from one bar and a few booths, to a wrap around bar, then finally to the pool hall and extra bar area that you see now.  I have met U of I basketball coaches here, there are pictures of former Cubs players kissing my Mom (wait, what).  My parents originally met here.  It is safe to say my family has a mullti generational history here.Anyway, beyond the nostalgia, it is one of the best pubs to visit in the downtown area.  Just a great place to relax and have a few drinks.  Along with the evolution of the bar, so has the menu.  Now there is a mix of pub grub like burgers, fish sandwiches, etc.  Which I don't think are that great.  Though the various pizzas are very good.  As are the wings, which I am not typically a fan of.  Though these are baked, not fried and battered like most.  The Asian Dumplings are great as well.  The service can be hit or miss.  Depending on the time you come, and where you order.  Bar service is pretty good, but the waitresses can be a bit confused when trying to find you after you place the order.  Though they work hard, and always take care of anything that might be wrong.Drinks are pretty standard.  There are a handful of good micros on tap.  Usually something from Two Brothers or Dark Horse as the main micros available on tap.  A bit more extensive selection in bottles.  The rest is typical drinks for a neighborhood bar.Overall, not perfect.  Though the goods far out way the bad.  An institution in the downtown Champaign area, and a place I will always love.",

This place is also big, so it can feel busy without being shoulder-to-shoulder like some bars. It's just an all around nice place for a chill night or a party with a big group. Probably one of my favorite bars in Champaign. Just make sure you have your ID because they WILL card you!UPDATE: The jukebox is now gone. I am not happy.",

I would not put Esquire on that list.The decor is uninteresting at best. There is no personality. It's designed to appeal to a crowd that just wants a nice bright place to hang out and drink.Not being a drinker, I can't rate the Esquire on that, but I can rate them on the food, and the food is so forgettable, I forgot to review it. Our group had a couple of burgers, some wings, and a chicken sandwich. I was told the burgers were good. The chicken must be avoided at all costs.The sandwich is one of those strange creations that takes chicken strips and puts them on a bun. I'm not entirely sure why, as this makes an awkward eating experience. The strips were nearly tasteless. Thank goodness for mayonaise. My wife had the wings. After one or two, she was trying to figure out why they didn't seem right. I was going to eat them, but I couldn't, and I LOVE wings. These things had enough salt to turn Lake Michigan into a salt lake. They were awful.  I would not go back at all. I'll eat diner food, fast food, and other kinds of food, but not Esquire Food.

What I got was scattered peanut shells all over the floor and a normal bar scene. Despite this, this place features some cool billiards. It's a great place to watch sports games and the prices are quite reasonable for the amount of food they serve. They have a condiment bar so you can put as much tomatoes, lettuce, pickles, and/or onions on your food. My burger and fried mushroom meal came out to be $8.49. And if you're feeling like a hipster, they have PBR pints for a dollar on Sunday.",

It was a Saturday night, when the bar is super crowded.  We were a group of 4, and as always finding parking spots on downtown Champaign can be a such a chore in weekends. Anyway, you order your food to the bartenders. Waiting for the bartender to notice you in a crowded bar could be ok if you want to order a beer or shot, but for food? I don't like the idea. I ordered a Greek Pizza, while the aforementioned friend ordered a garden pizza (I can't remember the name now, but it was their vegetarian pizza) . To be honest, I dodn't like either of them. The Greek one was a disaster. It had clusters of feta cheese spread over a thin crust, and almost nothing else. It was supposed to have sausage, but I couldn't taste any. The vegetarian one, although being the better one, was kind of juicy. A juicy pizza is NOT my favorite. I'm not against non-American-style thin crust pizzas. As a matter of fact, I love Jupiter's pizzas. But these ones, well, you heard me. There should be a reason these were so cheap (I guess around $7), and I now know it.",

This place is right across the street from the station. I sat by myself at the bar, but there were plenty of others riding solo as well. It was THAT kind of place - where the locals can come and drown away their sorrows. Actually, it was much more than that - this place seems to have a little bit of everything. There are pool tables in the back, so you can get that sort of crowd. There are larger tables as well, so you can see some large groups of students gabbing away. There are a good amount of TV's, so there were some people watching the evening college football games. There are decent sized booths, so I saw a couple people typing away on laptops. And there's a jukebox, so some people are silently rocking out to the classics. And perhaps best of all, there were plenty of townies around for some great people watching. At one point of the locals who had clearly had too much to drink began serenading a nearby booth with the Canadian National Anthem. Although he didn't get the words right, I gave him an A+ for effort. The bartenders called the guy a cab and made sure he got home okay. It felt like I was inside some sort of insider club where everybody is friends, and even the students are cool with the townies.The beer selection was surprisingly good. There were a lot of good import options available, although I stuck with $2.25 Bud Light drafts. Remember, I was taking the Amtrak home, so that shows you how much money I wanted to spend.... They have $1.50 PBR drafts too, which is what the locals stuck to. The food was pretty good as well. I had a simple cheeseburger and fries. Although not my favorite burger/fries combo, it was definitely worth the $4.50 I paid. The \"fixin's table\" they have is nothing more than onions, pickles, and tomatoes next to some condiments and sauces - Nothing special there. But there was something cool about being able to put that stuff on yourself, I guess.The charm of this place lies in the characters that visit, and for that alone, I am giving a 5 star rating. The cheap food and beer is an added bonus. And I almost forgot, free peanuts! If I return to Champaign any time soon, I will definitely be back to this place.",

Their fries are wonderful to chow down on when you're feeling pretty happy, and their honey mustard is ridiculously good (not sure what kind they use, but I need that in my life!). I was a little disappointed they didn't have Bulleit bourbon, but it could just be a southern thing. I got over it quickly, Makers is a good substitution in my Old Fashioneds.

I first discovered it while I was working for the city across the street and would come over for lunch quite a bit to get a steak sandwich while I was in the process of packing on the pounds.  I've since lost weight and now I eat the black bean veggie burger (absolutely delicious).  Esquire has grown and changed (a bit) over the years to accomodate the changes in downtown Champaign, but it still retains much of its original character.  I think it and the Brass Rail are the only two places left where you can really hang with the hardcore downtown alcoholics.  I mean HARDCORE!  Esquire is awesome!",

Its journeyman efforts will win friends and a few high fives, but it is not the flashy varsity letterman. Food here is just fine, and very reasonably priced. I have been disappointed with the size of their appetizers once or twice, but their entrees are a solid value, cooked dependably to be exactly what you expect in pub grub. Prices are very good for downtown Champaign, but they lack the booze selection of a Radio Maria or Blind Pig. The gross looking jar on the bar is infused vodka.Service is always friendly, and fastest at the bar. If you sit at their pretty awesome outside tables, the trade off is that you're gonna get ignored. You can order lunch ahead and pick up 15 minutes later. The free peanuts are priceless, as are the friendly patrons who are more likely than other crowds in town to strike up a convo with you. All this sounds pretty complimentary, but the fact is that this place is not stand-out awesome in any particular way. If you want to take your friends from Chicago to visit 4 places in downtown Champaign that are all different from each other, to give them an idea of what the \"new\" Champaign has to offer, you aren't going to stop at Esquire. Of course, that's just fine with me. I'll at the end of the bar eating peanuts and saying to some dude I just met holy shit the White Sox sure are Cubbing it hard this September.",

It somehow manages to straddle the line in such a way that nobody really seems to feel out of place there.  The burgers are some of the best in Champaign.  They have a good char-grilled taste to them that so many other, more pretentious, places lack.  There are a large number of sides to select from, including fried mushrooms, onion rings, french fries, potato chips (which, sadly, just come from a bag), fried broccoli, and Asian dumplings (which my friends tell me are fantastic).  I've had the polish sausage once, and it was passable, but nothing special.  The pizza is good and comes in a number of varieties.The one complaint I have is that the service can be especially hit-and-miss.  There have been times I've been served wonderfully, and there have been times I've been ignored for a half-hour just to refill my drink.Overall, Esquire is a down-to-earth place with good prices and good food.",

I'm not a huge fan of the aesthetic (my inner OCD hates the peanut shell on the floor schtick) but it's a pretty good bar.The food, on the other hand, has been consistently underwhelming. I haven't tried the pizza yet, but that's because I've been unimpressed by the other stuff I have tried. The appetizers tend to be greasy, and the chicken fingers were weak.

It's also the place I had my first legal drink, the place I arranged my first (extremely underwhelming) one-night stand, the place I had my first post-breakup talk ... the list goes on and on. In short, the Esquire is a place of firsts for me, and for that reason it holds an unimpeachable place in my heart.It's a good place, even taking none of the above into account. The prices are reasonable, the service is friendly, the drinks are stiff, the food is tasty, the jukebox kicks much ass (except on one night a few years back when some doucherocket fed about a million dollars into the machine and played Pogues records all night, but I am willing to let bygones be bygones). There's a nice array of seating options: small tables, mid-size tables, large booths, and the bar itself, which is the best place to sit if you want super-fast service and a good vantage point for eavesdropping and people-watching. There are also some tables outside, which are nice places to park your ass if you're a smoker or like keeping an eye on the goings-on along Walnut. The outdoors is heated during chilly weather, and although it doesn't too a ton of good in the dead of winter, it's lovely on brisk autumn nights.The people who frequent this place are an interesting mix. Some townies, some students, some regulars, some noobs. You're just as likely to see a gaggle of hipsters looking vaguely out of place as you are to see a group of middle-aged business types in dad jeans. Every once in a while some truly fresh and interesting personalities will be present, such as a trio of cackling cougars sipping pineapple margaritas and flirting with any male under the age of 26, or two sharply-dressed men having a snappy but ultimately friendly conversation you ache to be a part of, or a crusty old man with a walrus mustache who will pound your table with a hammy fist and yell something that sounds friendly but is completely unintelligible. Oh, and every once in a while Tim Lash of Hum fame will be hanging around, which I think we can all agree is pretty delightful. (I do not advocate drunkenly pestering him, of course, but if you do want to say hi be assured that he's about the nicest dude on earth and will receive your attention with much grace and warmth.)One of the best, most endearing things about this bar is its all-around friendliness. I often go here by myself in the evening with whatever book I'm currently reading, fold myself into a corner, and order a few beers. Not once has any patron or staff member given me grief over this, and for that I am truly grateful. Yes, the linoleum is hideous and yes, the bathrooms are a little iffy, but all the bartenders remember my name, and that's something that can't be beat.",

The people that sit out on the patio are always so friendly and the staff is quite attentive to your needs as well.

You could say I grew up throwing peanut shells on the floor and stomping on them. (For the record, I still throw the shells on the floor, but I no longer do the accompanying dance--that stopped being cute around age eight.) Before my family moved away from Champaign, this was the number one place we would take out of town relatives visiting. Even as objectively yummier, cooler places opened up around town, Aunt So-and-so and Uncle Whatshisface would always demand to be taken back to Esquire, and we were always happy to oblige. It's a comfortable, unpretentious bar, and that's what you needs sometimes.It's all about the ambiance, really. There are better burgers in town, but at Esquire it's the whole package that keeps me coming back. That and those peanuts. For real.",

She had been to Esquire before and said the burgers were good.  I really like the place.  I had the chicken tender sandwich with fries, and it was FABULOUS.  Everything a fried chicken finger sandwich could be.  At first it was delivered to the table empty, just a bun and chicken fingers.  But then I was told of the \"Fixin's Table\" where I got to add my own lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, and a sauce(s) of my choosing. I enjoyed sitting outside and watching the people walk by.  And when my other friend showed up with her dogs, they didn't mind at all.  And she loved that they had Fat Tire on tap.Overall, I would definitely recommend this place.  The only problem with sitting outside is that you do not get to throw your peanut shells on the floor- you have to bring a bowl outside for the shells... ah well...  On those cold winter nights I can throw my shells on the floor inside.",

When we got to the coffee shop, it was inexplicably closed. So as we sadly walked back to our desks, we pondered \"where can we get a black bean burger from?\" He mentioned \"doesn't guido's have them\" and I'm like \"yeah\". But we also wanted to get the fried mushrooms, and sadly, guido's doesn't have fried mushrooms. On a happy note, they have eggplant fries. So, we drive to downtown Champaign. Walk into Guidos. I  attempt to sit at the bar (as I'm bar folk) but he doesn't prefer that (he gets plumbers crack sometimes and doesn't like to sit in exposed back chairs... tmi?) So we grab a booth. Immediately a server comes to take our drink order, mountain dew for me, diet for him. Drinks arrived momentarily. She asks if we need some time to look at the menu. As we knew what we were in for, we said \"nope\". Both ordered the black bean burger, his with fries, mine a side of the eggplant fries and toppings on the side. I go to do outside things. I come inside, sit down, we chat about office things. Food arrives shortly thereafter.Black bean burger is as good as a black bean burger can be (and that's pretty good). Eggplant fries are both eggplant and fried. He tries one, as he's never heard of such a thing, he becomes a fan. She refills his diet. Food is done, she asks if we are ready to pay, we say yes. She drops the checks. She comes back a minute later when we've pulled out our cards. She runs them. She brings it back. We sign. We go.It's about as perfect a blackbean burger and eggplant fries lunch as you could ask for.  I managed to not go play the devil boxes.",

I feel like some reviews here are punishing Guido's for being what it is: a place to grab decent burgers and bar food, beers, and maybe take a chance on a mixed drink. If you have a fancy drink request or want a specialty cocktail, perhaps you shouldn't go to a sports bar in a college town.That said, I've never been here late at night, and I could completely see this as begin a place that would have a vibe I'd hate at that time (again - college town, people, know what you're getting into), but coming here on a weekend during the day or right after work is nice, especially if you want to watch some games.",

I was surprised to not have to wait for a table during the height of Saturday dinner rush. Once I sat down our waitress came by, gave me a water and took my beer order. Totally friendly and personable, she took good care of us [wish I could remember her name!]. The five of us were catching up and she seemed to have perfect timing for when to come by for drink refills/seeing how we're doing.I ended up with the Western burger and eggplant fries [thanks be to Yelp]. Totally in love with the entire meal. I'd never had an eggplant fry before and would come back just for a basket of those suckers. Definitely a cool place in an area that seems to be getting fairly hip.",

It's probably a good place to go if you've had a couple drinks already, aren't in ANY hurry and just want bar food.  It was a definite bar-feel inside and like I said, good location for sitting outdoors.  That was the appeal, but  I won't waste my time again.",

I have not come to this restaurant and sat upstairs to get real service or anything. But, there is a great space downstairs that is versatile and easily used for events. The bartenders are always very friendly and nice. Also, the bar food is fantastic but it usually is always running late coming out of the kitchen. But please, indulge in the quesadillas, tiny burgers, and chicken fingers with honey mustard :D.",

                "review": "Over the course of a week, there comes a time in a college student's life when the dining hall food is not an option and cooking a meal requires too much effort. On this particular Thursday, that is exactly what my roommate and I were going through. We typically go for our favorite restaurants (usually the ones within a short drive), however, we tasked ourselves with trying new restaurants in the Champaign-Urbana area this semester. And that is how we ended up at Guido's Bar & Grill. Menu: Big font for the name and smaller font for food description; Subtle colors of maroon, black, goldish yellow, brownI am the type of person that usually is able to find something right away no matter what the menu offers. However, this time was difficult because the menu did not have as much as I expected. I was in the mood for a sandwich and decided to get the Buffalo Chicken. This consisted chicken breasts battered and deep fried, spicy sauce, melted Swiss cheese, ranch or bleu cheese dressing (I chose bleu cheese)! I honestly only chose this option because it came with all toppings and a choice of a side item. Might as well get the most out of my money, right? For my side choice, I chose my favorite of tater tots. Restaurant: Spacious room with the bar in the center and surrounded with multiple booths with low lighting. My roommate and I decided on takeout and were surprised at the amount of people in the restaurant who were studying and networking. When we walked in, we simply walked to the bar and were asked if we ordered takeout. When we said yes, the bartender simply gave us our receipts and then our food with minimal taste. Food: This is where it gets real. Nothing is more terrifying than a hungry college student and unfortunately, Guido's did not meet the mark to satisfy my needs. The food was not as tasty as I expected and it might have been to the combination of the spice as well as the condiments. Also, on a sad note, the sandwich lacked the bleu cheese, which may have aided in the taste. For some reason, the blend of all the ingredients actually made the food quite bland. On a plus note, the tater tots were the perfect combination of crunch on the outside and softness on the inside. Overall, I do not think that I would return for any of the entrees at this restaurant. Yet, I do think that that their sides would be a great snack on a late night of studying!",

We finally got our drink order in and no one was ID'd (My friend is 21 and I am 23...we honestly should have been...), and then waited about 20 minutes for 5 beers. We luckily got our food order in at the same time and waited at least 30 minutes for that (and still, one of the dishes wasn't even ready and took extra time). Every time we wanted another drink, we had to wait 10 minutes to get the server's attention and then another 15-20 to actually get our drinks. Our server did not seem to be overly busy, wasn't at all in a rush, and never once apologized for the poor service/long wait. As a server in the area, I was very disappointed with the service my friends and I received and probably will not return here.",

If friends suggest Guido's, which they often do, because it is a vanilla compromise place, I cringe. I still go along, but my heels drag on the way there, and my feet get itchy after half a beer.There are a million places just like Guido's on the North Side of Chicago, and I think that a high proportion of the patrons here represent next year's crop of Chads and LP Trixies. Guido's isn't 100% a Campustown bar, but its on the way. Teej T.'s observation re: the crowd is 100% accurate, and unfortunately asshats like this are more the rule than the exception. Food is pretty decent, prices a little on the high side for pub grub, but a good value for lunch. The place gets pretty crowded on Thurs-Sat nites, and the service gets understandably slow then. Good, but stingily-portioned onion ring sides. I say if you're gonna upcharge me for onion rings, I want a lot of 'em.Objectively, the place is 'fine' in a ho-hum way. Subjectively, the intangible anti-culture, anti-intellectualism, anti-anything that is novel, interesting, and unique in favor of everything that is popular, faux-hawked, slutty, and top-40 brings this place down a peg.",

The teriyaki chicken sandwich was very salty and very dry.The eggplant fries stole the show.  They were delicious, with a side of grainy honey mustard for dipping.  They're probably the only thing I'd go back for.Also, if you want a cup of coffee (as my dad did) be aware that they use a Keurig, and therefore, charge by the cup.  No free refills on your joe.",

I just wanted to know what was on tap at your bar.  Give me a break.  After my drink, I left my group and had a wonderful experience at Radio Maria.",

I only ever go there during the day as the crowd at night is a bit too annoying. Tends to be frequented by young (early 20s) looking to score. Not really my scene.For the food there are better burgers & sandwiches, better nachos, and better salads at the many other places downtown. The staff is very friendly and the prices very reasonable but again I can find that at most of the places downtown.During the summer it is nice to sit outside as they have a prime people watching location.Guido's is good for large groups.",

It was lively but not crowded.They have dark red paint and cherry wood in here, which individually are quite handsome but do not match well together.  In general, though, it's an attractive place with a mellow atmosphere.  One detraction:  the bathrooms are terrible, far worse than you would expect given the rest of the establishment.  Service was friendly and attentive from our two waitresses.   The first one could not name the bar's whiskeys besides \"Jameson, Jack, Jim, Crown\" (thankfully I ended up with Woodford Reserve) but give her credit for at least knowing what \"whisk(e)y\" is (you'd be surprised).",

There is always a place to sit, the service is fast and friendly, and they have a great menu that leans slightly towards the southwest. Their southwestern quesadilla with the cajun chicken is amazing. I don't usually like things with corn, roasted or no, but the whole thing is delicious and not laden with grease. The grilled tortilla is flavorful, as is the side cup of southwestern sour cream they give you to dip each bite in. Other good eats are their onion rings, Cobb salad (and it's under $9--cheap by my book), and Buffalo chicken. Bottom line, I dig Guido's.",

Clean, fairly spacious and a cool atmosphere. We looked over the menus and started with quesadillas. The menu is pretty basic, most of your standard bar food, plus a few salads and a few other options. Nothing too crazy, but we really weren't looking for anything too different tonight so it was all good.The quesadillas were pretty tasty. The cheese was melty and the corn and other contents were tasty as well. Not 5 minutes after our quesedillas came, so did our sandwiches. I ordered the (only available on Friday) beer battered cod sandwich and she got a buffalo chicken sandwich. Mine was pretty tasty. Very messy to eat but I think anything beer-battered is pretty good. The fish was a decent portion, too. I got tater tots for my side and these were pretty standard, as most tater tots are. She said she liked her buffalo chicken sandwich, and that's all I can say for that.Our server was nice, but the entire experience seemed a little rushed. We got our sandwiches a bit too quickly after our appetizer came out. I wasn't even 75% done with my sandwich when we were asked if we wanted anything else, and when we said no she asked if we wanted the check. I'm not the fastest eater, but the whole sit down experience couldn't have been longer than 20 minutes, it was a little too rushed especially since there wasn't really anyone waiting to be seated.My other qualm was the price. Our entire meal, 2 sandwiches and 1 appetizer, without drinks, came out to nearly $28. After tip, we were at nearly $35, for bar food, with just water as our drinks. I just think this was way too expensive for what it was. At nearly $20/person there are definitely better options in the area. I also remember the one time I came here last semester, the drinks were pretty expensive too.Overall, it was expensive for what it was, I felt a little rushed, but the food wasn't bad.",

It was about 5pm, and sure, it was raining, but the lights were turned down really low, ready for the night crowd (although it seemed a little early for night time lighting).  So I thought it was a little dark, but anyway...I had the bacon cheeseburger, and it was alright.  I'd give it an average rating.  You would think paying $8 for a bacon burger, they would put more than 2 skimpy slices of bacon on it.  The fries were good though.  They were the super skinny ones, sort of like Murphy's.  I did not check out their beer selection, not because it was a business meeting, but I had serious studying to do after wards, so I can't comment on that aspect.  I can see it being a good place for groups to go.  Not sure what the night crowd is like.  It's maybe a little fancy, but not required.  Like, if you wanted to \"go out\" and \"dress up\" you could probably go here, but if you were in jeans and a t-shirt that would be okay too.  Know what I mean?The waitress was nice, it has a large, open area, I think a pool table, and booths and tables along the perimeter.  And outdoor seating.",

Their heated patio was key during the winter months, but now it's just great outdoor seating. The staff is all very friendly. Make sure to check it out, and get a bucket of beers!",

They have specials for food every day. While it's standard bar food, there are the delicious Bosco sticks--warm breadsticks filled with hot melty cheese. The beer is cheap. Most of the fun, for me, is people watching. There are lots of locals, and they are all hilarious. My favorite experience was learning video poker from three kindly gentlemen. Plus, it's close to Black Dog. Perfect place to go after you're stuffed with barbecue.",

Pork tenderloin, Italian Beef, a burger, and a steak sandwich.  There are also daily specials, like a shark or walleye sandwich on Fridays that might be the most interesting fish sandwich in Chambana.

They have six taps, and 5 have some variety of mass produced light lager with one serving guinness. They do have more variety in bottles. The past couple of weekends, they've had fat tire and sierra nevada pale ale in bottles but that's probably going to be the most variety you'll find there.",

I had the fish sandwich which is about the same as any other fish sandwich.  I was not blown away by it by any means.  But I was however blown away by their chili!!!  I have never had chili that I can honestly say is as good if not better than mine.  Since I have only been here twice I am not sure if it was better than usual for some reason but I can say it was pretty darn good chili!The chips they serve with the fish sandwich are bland and tasteless.  The cole slaw has horseradish in it.  Some people in my group loved it while others did not. Me included.  Someone tried the shark and they thought it was good.  I don't think I would go out of my way to eat here but with a group and the boss paying then heck yes I would go back.",

The one I get is called the Broadway Burger, double meat, and all I have to say is \"Swiss\", \"Cheddar\", or \"American\". It comes with a bag of chips so if you want fries you have to order them but this burger doesn't need fries, Load up the burger at the condiment rack with lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, whatever, and you have the best burger around. I know, I've eaten a burger at just about every place in all of Champaign County, and this is the best.",

The inside was nicer than I expected for a tavern, so that was a pleasant surprise. Lots of locals inside, I think we were the only students there. They have slot machines which I elected to try and lost $3.They have a decent selection of bottled beer, but only a few common ones on tap, Guinness included so I was happy to be able to get one of those.The bartender seemed nice, although I don't think he knew how to properly pour a Guinness. Not a big deal.I didn't feel that Bunny's was by any means inexpensive though, at least for me. Both of my beers were $4.50, my friends Jim Beam and coke was $3.50. The campus bars are probably cheaper though if you're really just looking to save $.Overall an A-OK experience, I'd come back again and would like to try the food.",

I would probably prefer to come for breakfast, but that wasn't in the cards today.The service was very good. Our waitress was polite, food came in a reasonable time, and drinks were refilled regularly. We were also brought our check in a speedy manner, which I always like.Food: I had a buffalo chicken wrap, my wife had a hamburger and my son had a reuben sandwich and fries. All the food was very good.The only negative is the scrum at the front door/register when you are on the waiting list or paying your bill. Of course, part of the charm of Courier is the old time feeling the place gives, and a large waiting room would probably detract from that.Next trip: breakfast!",

The couple next to us got up and left because nobody would take their order.Inexcusably bad service, inexplicably bad food. Come on, Urbana, for once, accept the fact that some businesses are meant to die. In case you don't get out much, the Courier Cafe is terrible. They are operating as if they have no competition.Suffering through a shit sandwich and bad service is a stupid way of supporting local business.

We order a turkey club sandwich and a chicken salad sandwich which took 20 mins to get. Then I waited another 10 mins for my french fries. The food was average and the price was decent.",

I don't know to describe to be Old Victorian but it is old school for sure. The seats are all wood, wooden floors, dim lighting, classic wooden benches, and there is even an old school cash register. Definitely a blast in the past to the early 20th century. Very classy and clean place that had a warm, home feeling.The food? What can I say. AMAZING. It is just simple, American, home-cooking! I have had just about everything from the awesome burgers (which come in a ton of different ways), steak sandwich, soups, deep fried shrimp, most of the pies, and the sundaes. Best of all, it's all fairly cheap!The service was also awesome! I went here with a large party of nearly 20 people and I went here with just 3. Both times the service was amazing. There is this elderly guy there with glasses and he is just very nice, funny, and personable to us every time.I have made this a regular place for me to go when I am in the Urbana-Champaign area.",

The only place I can think of that competes with it in terms of a Venue is a cafe near the old train station, but I think that closed 2 decades ago ...This is a popular late-night place to go after Contra Dancing in Crystal Lake Park, or even dancing at the Regent ballroom.

The second, unfortunate, visit I had some sort of catfish fry which again was covered in grease and was somewhat dry with no real taste of its own, I drowned it in sauce to eat it. The biggest problem, and one I notified them of, was the \" soup\" they were serving that day. The menu listed a creamy corn soup but what arrived was a watery, yet clumpy, mass of starch with bits of tasteless bacon, which I don't eat by the way,  and pieces of canned corn masquerading as soup. I was really disappointed and upset, mainly with the food but neither the, really unfriendly, waitress nor the hostess gave a damn. I'm never coming back; just because something has been around for a long time it does not mean that this thing is good, and that's the case with this cafe.",

The black bean burger while not terrible, just wasn't for me. It was really bloated and mushy which made it difficult to eat. I had to just eat it with a fork. I'm used to something a little more dense and solid like a burger would be. The salad bar was delicious. REALLY great selection and everything was fresh. My one complaint would be that I'm 5 ft 6in, which is not really that short, and it was really difficult to reach toppings and their \"sneeze guard/window\" apparatus is really awkward. But it's worth the hassle. You go up and get your salad, they weigh it and you give the ticket to the sever. I got a very large salad for about $5.  Love this place. Great ambience, great food.",

We waited a while to be seated even though many of the tables were unoccupied (possibly because the host was also the cashier ringing people up as they finished their meals).  As soon as we were seated, I quickly noticed that some of my silverware had dried food stuck and even my elbows stuck to the sticky table.  We ordered the steak and eggs, which lacked seasoning.

A few days ago, I went with my friend and our two kids (baby and a 2 year old). I got there and stood at the top of the steps for, no joke, 10 minutes before the host even acknowledged me. But they were swamped and I gave him the benefit of the doubt. I've worked in food service. When he finally asked if I \"needed something,\" I was confused. The sign clearly says, \"Please wait to be seated.\" I told him I was waiting for a table, and he said, \"Oh, there's one down there,\" and pointed towards the kitchen. My friend and I took our seats, and the host brought a high chair. Someone brought us water, and another 10 minutes later, our frazzled, odd server came to our table. She asked if we were ready to order, and we looked down and said, \"Well.... we never got any menus....\" She came back with the menus, blamed it on someone else, and we ordered our food. Every time she came to the table, she had some sort of snide comment -- maybe she was just having a bad day or that's her personality, but it was annoying. It would have helped if she would have ever brought us refills, checked to be sure we liked our food, asked if we needed anything else. At the end of the meal, she said, \"Gosh your table is so quiet,\" which we both laughed at. How would she know? She never stopped by!The food, however, was fine. I ordered a Dagwood Sandwich (after the hostess said, \"Well, that's a LOT of food,\" and I politely responded, \"OK and I'll also have a side of fries.\") I got the sandwich with just mustard, no secret sauce or mayo, and it's was pretty good (it was a tall sandwich). I shared the sandwich and fries with my 2 year old. We had a few fries left over, to give you an idea of how much food it ended up being.The bill was about $10 -- on the high end for lunch, but considering it was a large lunch, it seems pretty reasonable.Lunch was fine, but I think I will stick with breakfast at the Courier.

What I got in return was the bland little sad looking piece of fish about the size of a playing card. It was cod. It was flavorless. It was served with thin slices of lemon on top of it. It served no purposes other than to falsely suggest there would be some lemon-y taste. Also on the plate were three slices of cucumber and a slice of tomato. Not sure why. Perhaps it was there so that I could rate which item was the most bland on the plate.I have been to courier cafe a few times, and I've always ordered some sort of burger or sandwich. They always came out as expected for a sandwich. It tasted good and it was filling. This on the other hand, left me disappointed as I compared the value and price of my meal against my friend who ordered a sandwich that costed less.

Fortunately, we arrived early enough not to have to wait for a table, because this place got crowded really quickly. (For good reason!) I had a courier burger (burger with bacon) with fries and coleslaw. I really appreciate how they put the burger toppings on the side of the plate, because it lets you assemble the burger however you want to, and makes the dish more presentable. The burger came out very neat and clean; I didn't have to deal with a sauce-filled, drippy mess, like some other places. It was all very appetizing, though nothing to write home about. I would avoid the coleslaw, however, which was disastrously drenched in mayonnaise, and after a few bites, I just set it to the side untouched. I totally dig the antique-style decor in this restaurant. This is one of Urbana's landmark establishments; if you're looking for a place to enjoy a cozy meal with friends, definitely make a trip over here.",

The other reviewers have summated the greatness of this place pretty well, so I'll just add in how great the prices are. I had a rib-eye steak sandwich, iced tea, and a mocha milkshake for about $13. I could not eat another bite the rest of that Saturday Night, phenomenal. The ambiance is also great, the building feels very \"homey\" with all the wood paneling and old-school wallpaper.SO,go, eat, and drink milkshakes: for places such as the Courier are getting harder and harder to find!",

Our party of 5 was placed at a table by the front window, which was so cold, being next to the door. Not to difficult to crank up the heat to compensate!Our order consisted of 2 burgers, Broiled pork tenderloin, fish tacos, and white meat fried chicken.The courier burger was alright, but not really anything phenomenal. My mother had the broiled pork tenderloin, which I tasted and it had a good flavor to it. My wife had the fish tacos, which she liked. My sister ordered the fried chicken but she said it was nothing special and she could do better at home. The time spent waiting for our food was pretty unreasonable. More than a half hour spent waiting on food to arrive to our table, which feels much longer when you are freezing cold(we kept our coats on and were still cold).The fried chicken apparently was the item that held up our table. You would think with the amount of time they took, they would have gotten it right, but you would be wrong. It was supposed to be all white meat, but instead was a breast, thigh, and leg. The waitress said they must have mixed them up in the back. We took this as \"I grabbed the wrong plate\" but after another 5-10 minutes she hadn't come back. When she finally did come back, there was no offer to get what was ordered, but instead she offered to take a cheeseburger off our bill.So rather than make it right, we got \"go ahead and eat the thing ya didn't want, and we'll comp the cheeseburger your son ordered.\"My sister started to eat the breast and on the 2nd bite almost puked right there at the table as she had bitten into a long black hair that was laced into the batter.At that point we alerted our waitress. The manager came over and said he would make the chicken dinner free and put the cheeseburger back on our bill.\"Damn right you'll make it free, she had two bites and refuses to eat it!\"So she had essentially no dinner and was not offered anything else except a free desert. It's been about 10 years since I'd been to the Courier and I don't think I'll ever be going back again. We really should have waited in line for some of the amazing BBQ on the next street over.If ya don't mind freezing, waiting forever for your food, getting the wrong order, and then finding hair in it... Yea, go try Courier Cafe",

The only reason why we placed 2 stars is because of the food.-(Money-saving Mystery Butter blend) On numerous occasions when we dined here, we had a very hard time getting an order in. When ordering a plate, the waitress was cold and stern. We asked her to bring plain butter rather than their money-saving \"mystery butter blend\", and she was making a face and saying \"Oh I'm not sure I can do that\", despite the fact that they have pure butter at hand. She was selective about who she served and was overall rude.-(Kicking customers out the door) Then Chuck, the manager, and his waitress came up to our table well before closing hour and started moaning about how he is closing soon and was trying to kick us out in advance!-(Ignoring customers) The last time we came here, we sat outside as the waitress Nicole was serving someone else. Although we said \"hi\", *she blatantly ignored us* and we had to walk into the restaurant and talk to the manager JUST TO PLACE OUR ORDER. It was so bad. We watched the manager baby-sit the waitress as he told her \"you have customers waiting for you, Nicole.\"But she had seen us before and consciously ignored us.A few minutes after we came back out to dine outside, Nicole (the waitress) walked towards us and gave us a very phony smile. -(Insolent manager) On this other occasion, Chuck (The Manager) was chatting with us after dinner and he called my friend a \"Liar\" simply because he was trying to get him to guess where we were from. He also called us \"Disingenuous\" for the same reason.-(Summary) Overall, The Courier Cafe has great food, but due to a grumpy and harassing Manager, and rude waitresses who need to be *told* that they have tables waiting for them, we are strongly considering never dining there again.",

No hellos or how are yous..... just \"what do you want?\"  By that point, other patrons had come in and she seemed perky and friendly with them.  My food came out fairly fast, but my burger was underseasoned and overcooked.  At that point I just wanted to get out.  So I had to flag my now-chatty waitress who was paying attention to every other table and asked for my check, which she just slammed down on my table.   I didn't even bother leaving a tip nor will I ever return again.",

The inside is warm, but the bread is soft, not toasted. That was strange. The potato skins have changed, and I think this must depend on who is cooking. I didn't like these as much as the old ones. The old version was literally potato \"boats\". The new version are more like fries. I was told the quesadilla was only fair, not great. I ordered the phosphate as always, and it was a little bland.Maybe they need to up the quality of their food again. I wouldn't rush to go back as I always have.",

(you know... the stuff you usually rinse off thoroughly.)the service is generally fantastic.  a lot of their wait staff is attentive and friendly, especially in the morning.  there are some night staff that seem to forget you exist, but for the most part, it's decent service.  all in all, if your vegetarian or vegan, there are options, which is difficult to find for a sit down meal in this town and don't feel like having sushi or lo mein.  i would give it 4/5 but just because the quality of some things ... like service and salad bar... is hit or miss.",

It was a splurge for me then, though I'm sure that the prices were as low as they are today. Now, it was time to bring my niece here, the night before she registered for her classes and we took a tour of my old abode, Allen Hall, which is now her casa for the next year.  And I guess it was our lucky day: I tried the coin-op crane and scooped up a prize, she got to chew the gummy fruits of my lucky labor. I had the quesadilla, which was large and tasty. Don't expect it to have the authenticity of Mxico; I wouldn't expect it to in a place so resplendent in Americana. But the American adaptation was a treat.Near a campus that has changed from mom & pop restaurants, it's very much worth the trek to get some home-style cooking in a historic, small business.",

Sunday morning brunch after V-day with the boy seemed like a good option. It was pretty hoppin and the inside was just what I expected it to be: very cute and eclectic, smattered with antiques (but not in the Cracker Barrel way.. in the authentic way), and cozy. Because the menus on the website don't say when breakfast ends and lunch begins, we weren't sure if we would have the option of choosing from either menu. We got there at around 11:35, and the hostess gave us menus with just breakfast. The menus are large, so if you take a while to decide (especially during brunch time...) be careful. Our waitress stopped by once immediately after we were seated to get our drink orders, and once about five minutes later. We told her we needed a few minutes. She came back shortly after and snapped at us, saying that they were only serving breakfast for 5 more minutes so we needed to order then. This was at around 11:45. I understand wanting to expedite things, but if the switch was happening at 11:50 shortly after we arrived, I think we should have been told by the waitress or the hostess that lunch was about to start (after we had been seated I saw people ahead of us getting salads and soups, but no lunch option was given to us). Anyway, he got the breakfast burrito and I got the breakfast sandwich. His was very good and enormous! The salsa verde was perfect.. I didn't even know I liked salsa on eggs. I think I just misordered in my haste. The croissant was not from their bakery.. it had the \"I came out of a cellophane wrapped plastic container from Sam's\" taste, but it was large.. just not a real croissant. The eggs were another problem: they were a consistent yellow color and had rounded borders. Not real scrambled eggs.. or maybe real but reconstituted. The bacon was tasty, the hashbrowns mushy. Not worth $7. He gave me half of his burrito in exchange for half of mine. I greatly benefited from the unfair trade! I really want to like this place, so I'll try it again in the next few weeks! Hopefully I'll get a smiley waitress. FYI: prices are a little higher than those listed on the online menu (but only about 50-60 cents).",

Second time was with my fiance, and we waited over an hour for our food to arrive. After repeatedly trying and failing to make eye contact with the waitress while she generally chatted with her coworkers, I asked her to check on the kitchen. She came back with the food within less than two minutes, saying luckily the food just came out. But everything was cold, which is proof to me that she simply forgot about it. This service is unacceptable, and would warrant a 1 star rating if not for the first time. There probably won't be a third though.",

Though the waitress got our order wrong (two of us didn't want onions on our items), the food was still magnificent. Half of the Dagwood sandwich was enough to make me feel satisfied. We ordered the brownie special. Indeed, that brownie now has a special place in my heart. The brownie special can be enjoyed by two-three people. It is a brownie topped with vanilla ice cream, whip cream, and a side of chocolate syrup. I gotta say that the brownie itself inundated my senses with a resplendent sweet flavor.",

Service here is cheerful, friendly and professional, and both the hostess and waitress greeted us when we entered. We skipped the homemade pastries and muffins, as they're not on the diet right now, but they looked great. I had an omelet with spinach, mushrooms and cheddar and it was very good, with very fresh veggies. The hash browns they serve are delicious...crispy without and fluffy within. They make their own bread and I tried the cinnamon toast, which was a white bread that my baker husband says was brioche dough, and made for some great toast. He tried the oatmeal with fresh berries and walnuts, which was made with whole oats. The regular size is a very good sized serving of oats...you can get a half order if you're appetite is smaller. I asked of they use real butter...I'll order my toast dry before I'll eat margarine...and she assured me they do, which I greatly appreciate. Two thumbs way up for this delish breakfast. I'll be back for lunch.",

My wife had the 'Ham and Scram' and a side of pumpkin pancakes that were on special.  The eggs were well cooked and the ham was really tasty.  It had the right hint of smokines which I thought was particularly pleasant.  I had the Spanish omlette which, as usually happens in gringo joints, was billed as 'hot' by our waitress.  It was merely low-medium.  Generous shots of hot sauce kicked my dish up to the real heat level for me.  Delicious coffee and really nice bread that made excellent toast was also provided.  Attentive service (but the restaurant only had ten patrons when we were there - right at opening) so it may not be representative.Not worth a special trip to Champaign-Urbana, but if you are in town or even passing by, a slight detour to patronize it is worth it.",

The sandwich was well piled but not overly so.  The chosen chili soup was huge - also very creamy which is different than I make it but was excellent!  Service was friendly and fast.",

Small, local, with plenty of great options for food. Whether it's the Banker's Burger, a Red Hot News sundae, a green river phosphate, any of their vegetarian dishes, or even just the sweet potato chips, the food is delicious and perfect each time, all for a great low price and friendly service. I've never been ignored and always seem to have a full glass of water without even knowing they swung by.The one thing that keeps Courier from being a super 5-star is if you're seated at anything other than a booth, it seems like you're one inch away from being knocked about by any of the staff or other patrons. Don't come if you have more than four people, it'll be next to impossible to keep you all together. However, I think Courier's still a great cozy place to get your grub on.",

There are a lot of vegetarian options- my favorite is the pesto grilled swiss on sourdough. I also love the ham melt on a fresh croissant. For dessert I recommend sharing a headliner, a monstrously delicious sundae drenched in hot fudge.For the quality of food you get, this place is actually a bargain. I'd prefer it over most of CU's \"fine dining\" establishments any day.

No tables with empty plates or spilled food under the tables. We were seated, given menus and glasses of ice water. We ordered our usual meals, my wife had a turkey croissant sandwich with french fries and I had a dagwood sandwich on white bread. We shared an order of potato skins which they call \"Skinny Dippers Deep\" which are fried potato skins covered with cheese, bacon, sour cream, and chives. They were awesome and filling, even with two people sharing the skinny dippers, we didn't really have that much room left for our sandwiches. My wife ate half of her sandwich and took the rest of it home. I took my whole sandwich home and had it for dinner. Was looking forward to getting a peanut butter cookie from the case near the register, but they were sold out. Their peanut butter cookies are about the size of your whole hand. All in all, they had a clean restaurant, fast & friendly staff, and great food, what else can you ask for?",

The food is American: sandwiches, burgers, soups, salads, and also more serious entrees. I was going to go for the salmon, but my waitress talked me out of it, so I ended up getting the pork chops, which came with soup. The soup was black bean soup: it was actually quite tasty, and the portion was huge (I expected just a small bowl, since it was supposed to be a side). I was almost full after finishing the soup and when the pork chops arrived, and that was a good thing because I was not too impressed by them... grilled pork chops lathered in bbq sauce, really nothing too exceptional, and the little side of salad that came with it didn't even have any dressing. So... the portion were huge, it was pretty cheap (I think I ended up paying under $15 including a soda), but the food did not impress me much. The service however was pretty friendly. I tried going again for brunch on a Sunday morning, but gave up when I saw the line... I guess it gets quite crowded on the weekend, which is generally a good sign, so I'll have to give it another try for brunch.",

                "review": "The other night, my girlfriend and I went out to the Courier Cafe in downtown Urbana. Having been there before, I knew that it was a good place to go for a relatively cheap meal (which is why I capitulated rather quickly). Courier Cafe is one of the older restaurants in downtown Urbana, having been open since 1980. As such, it has outlasted many other downtown Urbana businesses, and enshrined their memory in the names of its burgers.Speaking of burgers, they are the primary reason I go to the Courier Cafe. Burgers are around $5-6, and are 1/3 of a pound. The burgers also tend to be higher quality than the standard pub fare, considering people go there for food, instead of ordering a burger as an afterthought.On this night I opted for the Darcy's burger, which is a burger with mushrooms and bleu cheese. The burger comes on a plate with all of the other assorted toppings, including onions, tomatoes, lettuce, and pickles, off to the side, so you can add them to taste. The burger comes well done unless you specify otherwise. The meat itself is relatively juicy for being a grilled burger, and the bun tastes more like it came from a genuine bakery, instead of a store-brand 8 pack of buns, which often ends up being the case in burger restaurants.Another thing Courier is known for is its old-style sweet drinks, such as its phosphates and New York egg creme drinks. These are sugary soda-type drinks with flavored syrup, with the egg creme being a phosphate with an egg cracked into it and creme added. Courier also has a variety of ice cream desserts.Courier's wine and beer menu is not very extensive, but they have had Rogue Dead Guy on draft for $4 the last few times I have gone, which is cheaper than most bars in the area. In addition, their bottled beers are relatively cheap, and the wine by the glass is inexpensive as well. Though the menu is not extensive, there is a good enough variety to please most individuals.For two people with burgers, drinks, and one order of fries, the total bill ended up being $18.84. This is much lower than one would pay for an equivalent meal anywhere else, even a place like Murphy's (which has a similar food menu, though lower quality food). Courier is a perfect spot for a cheap date, where your date won't know you're being cheap unless you let her see the check.",

The burgers are great, the breakfasts are delicious, but that's not the reason I'm here so often.The real reason is the Chocolate Egg Creams. For those of you that aren't familiar, the chocolate egg cream, originating in New York (as far as I've heard), contains milk (not cream), chocolate syrup, and seltzer. That's right, no egg. The egg creams at Courier are delicious, however, you should all know, they are NOT authentic egg creams as they contain egg whites to help the top foam up. At any rate, very few places these days have egg creams, so it's great that this place still does. (But if nowhere near you has them and you want to try, they're way easy to make. My version: Fill a glass 1/3 with milk, add syrup til liquid height is 1/2 up the class, fill the rest of the way with seltzer, stir, taste, add more syrup if you wish!)",

My honey had the vegetarian chili and she really enjoyed that. I also ordered the southern fried chicken and that was real good.I have heard from a friend that there milkshakes are made old fashion in the metal cups and they even bring you out the cup which is nice.We got a slice of chocolate cream pie which was real rich and just right.We also got some homemade cheesecake and that was very tasty and rich.This place was packed and from being out of town it must be a popular place to eat.I can totally understand how this place got great reviews and we will come again.Although the service was slow we still enjoyed are evening at the courier cafe.On 6/2012 we went here for breakfast and it was delicious & hot da spot.Its def. a local eatery that should be visited when in Urbana,il.",

I devoured almost all the food and that's pretty rare for me.  The hash browns were a particular stand out.  Crispy on the outside and almost creamy-soft within.  Yum.They bake all the bread in-house and my toast was delish.  There's a case full of bakery-style treats, not sure if those were baked in house as well.Eggs, bacon, and toast were all pretty good as well.  I was not disappointed with anything.  I've yet to try the phosphates or milkshakes.  Combining flavors for a choc/peanut butter shake has been on my mind lately, tho...My four stars are for breakfast only; the three star holds for lunch/dinner.",

He took it back to the kitchen and when he came back, told me that they were out of the bread I ordered.  Ok...so why didn't someone come out and ask me what I wanted instead, rather than just making it with something else and hoping I wouldn't notice?  Seems pretty straightforward.  I got a new sandwich and by that time my boyfriend was almost done eating.After that, our waiter never bothered even stopping by our table again to check in, other than walking by to drop off the check.Sandwich was good (...the second one, sans hair) although the \"special sauce\" appeared to just be a mustard...maybe they were out of that too.",

While yes the place is technically a diner, it's really the only one I've ever seen that could be said to offer some historical interest as well; as the back of the menu describes in detail, the place used to be the home of the Courier Newspaper. Much of the decor hanging on the walls has some historical significance, which was so cool! Perfect place to bring an out-of-towner.The food was really delicious. I ordered a Spanish omelette, which was HUGE and came with potatoes and a choice of homemade bread (I chose sourdough bread). The potatoes came diced, and were fried slightly soft--almost like very very tender McDonalds hashbrowns. Not my preferred breakfast potato style, but I'll take it!! The omelette was my favorite part--stuffed with fresh jalapenos, onions, chorizo, and Chihuaha cheese. And so cheap, too! 8-ish bucks for a very generous meal.But the best part of the meal: the truly great service (particularly in contrast to the brunch experience I had had just the day before elsewhere, in Champaign). I don't remember her name, but our waitress just beamed amiable Midwest charm, and was very competent about getting us refills and keeping us apprised of the status of our dishes when there was a bit of a wait to get our food. My friend who brought us to this place has stories of how this same waitress would bring her hot tea with lemon when she was feeling ill.I believe it. And I'd gladly come back next time.",

By the end I just felt like I was eating a mush of sugar. To counteract this sugar, I also ordered from the salad bar. I liked the layout of the Salad Bar - you pay $0.38 per oz of salad you get, so I had a filling salad to go with my sweet sandwich for only $2.50! Not a very diverse salad bar, but I was fairly pleased.The other members of my party enjoyed their meal just fine, but we didn't feel this was anything special. The decor of the restaurant is very vintage, so it ;s kind of dark and has a different feel to it. After reading the reviews, I'm bummed I didn't order a milkshake!

I am SO SURPRISED by the reviews here! Did I come on a bad night?! This place was seriously bad!I went there with a bunch of friends and it was just underwhelming. Given the lack of customers, service was pretty slow. There were only a few menus for us to look at, and the ones that we got were covered with crayon and torn-- but the waitress was nice.My friends got the gazpacho but they said that it was fermented (i.e.,  old). I tried it and thought the same, WTH? I got the Courier burger-- simple bacon cheeseburger with fries. The burger was huge but it was extremely dry like sandpaper. I hate putting ketchup and mustard on a  burger, but I had to just to get the moisture back in my mouth! The fries are NOT fries, they're potato wedges. Have you ever been to Mcdonalds? Fries should look and taste like that. Com'on.I then got The Headliner (two scoops of ice cream with fudge, peanuts, whip cream and a cherry). It was okay, but nothing spectacular-- Joe Schmo who lives out in the dumpster could've made it...probably faster too. Given that we were one of the few groups in the restaurant, it took way too long to make it. Courier Cafe is overrated.",

I asked her to investigate some places we could get brunch, and she found Courier Cafe.  She said one of her girlfriends said it was really good.So, we got there and put our name in.  The restaurant is small, but homey, lots of antiques, reminded me of being at my grandma's old house.  We waited for maybe 20 minutes for a table.When we sat, we were given lunch menus.  When I inquired as to if they were still serving breakfast, one person said \"I don't know, let me check,\" one said \"no\" and the hostess came over and explained that we would've had to have been there by 11:45 to get on the \"breakfast waiting list.\"  It would've been nice if someone explained this to us when we got there, because 2 of the 3 of us REALLY wanted breakfast, and came to find it unavailable.  I was really disappointed.  I love breakfast.  I almost cried, legitimately.I digress.  There were plenty of tasty looking things on the menu, and I liked that all of their breads are made in-house.  Everyone enjoyed what they had.  My sister had the turkey croissant, and my boyfriend had the turkey club with a cup of chili.I had the Courier burger, which came with thick sliced bacon and cheddar cheese.  I could tell right away this burger was going to be delicious.  It was cooked on a flat-top griddle, which imparts such good flavor.  The patty was perfectly seasoned, and the cheese and bacon were just right. I didn't add ANY condiments or garnishes to the burger, just ate it as is.  The bun was a perfect brioche-y, eggy delight.Lunch for three came to $33.00.  I will certainly return the next time I am in Champaign, and try to get there early enough for breakfast.",

I ignored my intuition that this place is probably only suited for breakfasts.  There were limited items on the menu that were healthy.  I ordered the soup and sandwich combo.  I had black bean soup, which was pretty tasteless, and the chicken salad sandwich, which was unremarkable and doused in too much mayo.The worst part is my dining companion got the special, a chicken fajita bowl.  Now, let's grant that you probably shouldn't expect excellent Tex Mex in a joint with antiques and an Americana vibe.  But, he took the plunge.  He sincerely regrets this, as he was rendered useless after eating the bland \"fajita bowl\", which was more like chicken salad with jarred salsa in a taco bowl.  By useless, I mean he must have gotten an extreme case of food poisoning because he spent the entire remainder of the day making multiple trips to the men's room.After an experience with the food here that left us sick, I wouldn't come back.  There are much better places to grab a bite in downtown Urbana.",

I know you have friendly and skilled servers that have been happily working there for years who ask if you want separate checks before you even order.  I know your food is delicious and eclectic with your amazing, packed salad bar and uniquely named menu items like the Monkey Stuff sandwich with bananas, peanut butter, shredded coconut and honey; or your Rancheros Rarebit, the over-stuffed breakfast burrito doused in red sauce; or even simply, the Paperboy, Courier or Morning Edition breakfasts of eggs, toast, hash browns and choices of meats and fixin's.   You carry baked goods like powdered-sugar-topped brownies, gigantic cookies and breads such as the \"Bubby Bun\" -- I know this.  I know that you can make me a super sundae loaded with nuts and fruity goodies, or a Green River Phosphate with whipped cream foaming over the side of my frosty mug.  I know that you have a different flavored coffee offered every day of the week in addition to your regular and decaf, and I know that you sell bags of each flavor so that we may enjoy them at home any time we want.I know all of these things....So, why is it that every time I think of you and your wonderful establishment (you won't be leaving us any time soon, I am sure), the one thing that comes to mind again and again......is your hand-dipped, peanut butter shake.  Sometimes I wonder if I should have malt or chocolate added to compliment the peanut butter, but I always go back to just plain peanut butter.  I don't even care if you forget the whipped cream (although, you never do).  Just give me the peanut butter blended smoothly into the vanilla ice cream, in a frosty mug or a foam to-go cup and I am elated.  I will wait and wait how ever long it takes (because I know people line up to partake of your fabulous fare) just to take that first, satisfying sipand slip into a frosty bit of heaven.  And thank you, thank you for always making a little too much so that you have to bring out the metal shaker with the extra shake bits for sharing with my friends.  Because you know it's very difficult to want to share this with anyone.There is one more thing I know.  I will always be back to visit you every time I'm in town.  Because I do.  Thank you, Courier Cafe.Love,Clarissa J.",

They need to have more waitstaff when it is lunch hour, we waited an excessive amount of time for our food and check and I was quite annoyed. If they had more people during lunch hour maybe these problems would not occur. I would not suggest this place for lunch if you have other things to do in the middle of the day. Additionally it is quite loud when it is busy, it must be the acoustics of the building. It is kind of cool that it used to be a newspaper press.",

My favorite waitress takes good care of me and took the time to get to know me and what I order.  The flavored coffee of the day is always quite good.  I tend to have the same thing each time because I like it but I have tried just about everything on the menu and it is always good.  The menu is not as large as some breakfast spots but there is enough variety for everyone to find something.  The corned beef breakfast, the cakes and eggs with buckwheats, and the Spanish omelet are particular favorites.NOTE: Courier does NOT serve breakfast all day.  Weekdays, breakfast is served until 11 AM and weekends it is served until 11:45 AM.Note: Their Web page says \"The dining area is quiet and peaceful\".  Well, I went there for dinner for the first time and my \"quiet and peaceful\" meal was, instead, a cacophony of unwelcomed concertina music.  Seriously? Who does that?  Sorry, Courier, but you struck out with that intrusion.",

I ordered two eggs, sausage, potatoes, small fruit bowl and coffee. The waitress did an excellent job, looking over me just enough without being intrusive. The eggs, over easy, were too easy. The yolk was properly runny, but unfortunately so was the white. Sausages were tasty, but not seasoned enough. The hash browns were good, but could have been crisper. The English muffin that came with the meal was toasted well, but buttered too heavily. The total bill was $11.13, so plus the tip, my breakfast cost over $13.00. Next time I'll check the prices on the menu, I just assumed that they were in line with other breakfast eateries. I would give this place two stars if the service had not been excellent.",

There was also an annoying group of high-schoolers there who reserved 30 spots...yeah....Nice atmosphere. Very antique/ vintage feel. Drinks are old-timey as well. They offer phosphates. Friend got a German chocolate cake coffee. Smelled exactly like it. Recommend this as an Urbana-must.",

Overall, we had a good experience.Pros:-Service: The cafe was fairly busy, but we were seated right away, and we all had water glasses within a couple minutes. Our waitress was friendly, attentive, and very patient. If I could rate service separately, it would be a 5-star rating.-Decor: I like it! The theme seems to be old-timey newspaper, which is pretty cool. -Milkshake. Mr. Boyfriend and I got a peanut butter to split, and our friends got butterscotch. Awesome.-The \"Skinny Dippers,\" crispy, fried potato skins covered with cheese, bacon, sour cream and chives. These will make a person anything but skinny. We got a half-order to split, and ended up with approximately a bazillion potato skins. Wow.-Food in general: pretty good! -Menu: Quaintly themed, with desserts named after newspaper stuff (\"Headliner,\" \"Misprint,\" \"Cub Reporter,\" etc...). Standard American fare, sandwiches, burgers, etc.Cons, Almost-Cons, Slight Issues:-Price: It wasn't terribly overpriced for being right in downtown Urbana. I'm willing to pay $5.75 for a BLT. I just want the BLT to be a great BLT. The BLT was a good BLT, but it was a $4 BLT. Tiny slice of tomato, lots of lettuce, some decent bacon, on basic slices of wheat bread. The skins were $4.95, and these are SO worth it to split with a group, because of how good they are and how many we received. Milkshake was $3.75, I believe. Altogether, Mr. Boyfriend spent around $30 before tip for the two of us. -Timing: We arrived at 12:10, ordered by 12:15, and were served at 12:45. I had to be back at work by 1, so I had hoped the food would come out more quickly. This isn't a terrible wait, and like I said, the restaurant was doing good business. Still, I had ten minutes to eat, but 30 to talk. I would rather have 30 minutes to savor those potato skins, and ten minutes to talk to the jerks I call friends, but you can't always get what you want.",

We made it a little before the lunch crowd and I'm glad we did because they were packed!

Asking for a side of mayo is a mistake as they will bring you a 1/4 of mayo. The sweet potato chips are delicious. They also have a salad bar that has a decent selection.But ignore all of what I said above because none of it matters. Even if Courier had the worst lunch and breakfast food on earth, I'd still go for the shakes. Oh my god the shakes. I get the shakes thinking about their shakes. Feeling like a high roller? Order the apple pie shake. Some of the waitresses will not know what you are talking about, but once you explain it to them, they will make it. Piece of apple pie + ice cream + blender = apple pie shake. They will charge you for both a slice of pie and a shake, and it is worth every penny. Great to take your date who isn't watching her figure (or is way too damn skinny and needs to bulk up a bit). Seriously, stop reading and go get an apple pie shake!",

They're delicious, and you can combine flavors.  Sometimes I leave my house to go for the 20 minute walk for a milkshake.  It brings this boy to the cafe.",

(thanks, jane!)5 of us met there. we all used to work together - 4 RN's & 1 activity therapist. had a blast reminiscing about the old Mercy Hospital where we all worked - now Provena. (progress in motion....???)whatever...the courier rocks!",

Breakfast is my favorite meal to eat out and this spot did not disappoint! The service was a little slow to start, but after our order was taken, the food was delivered quickly and perfectly prepared. I ordered scrambled eggs with cheese, bacon, and whole grain bread toast. OMG, the bread was to die for! Husband ordered basted eggs, bacon, and rye toast. We considered the hash browns -- they smelled wonderful in the kitchen -- but are trying to watch our waistlines, so passed on potatoes this trip. They were working on setting up the lunch salad bar (it was about 10:30 when we got there) and it looked fresh and delicious. I'm looking forward to being in Champaign again so we can eat at Courier Cafe for lunch.",

A big breakfast is always a good way to kick off a day.I picked up a Denver Omelette with hash browns -- as much as I wanted to try the Spanish Omelette with chorizo, something about tequila in my eggs didn't really sound quite right. It was good. The omelettes here aren't mile-high and fluffy; they're more traditional omelettes, but still made with fresh ingredients.The hash browns were pretty good. Both maybe could have used a little more seasoning, but I was satisfied with both items.Now, the almond french toast -- if you like your french toast sweet, this is the item for you. The batter was spiked with serious amount of almond extract, and once you pour maple syrup over it... watch out! Still, it was very good. What few sips I had of the New York Egg Cream were also quite good. The chocolate flavor was pretty good (perhaps not as dark as I prefer, but... I have no idea what a New York Egg Cream is supposed to taste like) and also very sweet.For a basic breakfast, I wasn't blown away, but I would definitely go back to Courier Cafe for a good breakfast the next time I visit Urbana.",

My burger reminded me of a day at the park where you buy frozen burger patties from Costco and throw em on the grill. Where's In-and-Out when I need them? They also wouldn't cook my french fries extra crispy for some reason which was also another negative. The highlight was probably the hot fudge sundae but as a reminder, unless you like eating dessert as dinner, share that sucker with someone. I'd go here again if I wanted something super casual and laid back. But since I usually travel here with a band wagon of people, I'll have to take them elsewhere.",

The rest of the group was pleased with what they ordered, two of which are vegetarian. I do believe they had gluten-free options as well!",

I had the turkey croissant, which was good but gave me a vibe of how I could have made it at home.  I do not like how fries are not automatically included with sandwiches (see picture).  However, my boyfriend seemed to really enjoy his Southern Fried Chicken.  The Skinny Dippers were to die for, literally, there's sour cream, bacon and cheese on them!The ambiance is great and classic.  They have an ample number of wooden booths and a beautiful copper ceiling.  The menu looks like it came from a printing press used to advertise the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, for which I believe they have pictures of on the walls.I would recommend Courier Caf as great place to top off a dinner date meal, take your family, or catch up with friends.

My friend got the Buenos Dias burrito and a glass of milk.We both thought our meals were delicious. I particularly liked the fresh croissant that was the bread of my sandwich. The hash browns had a good balance of dryness and wetness, which I feel can be easy to goof up and make them too dry or wet sometimes. These were done right.Our server was pleasant but really busy. My only issue was with the coffee, I feel like it took way to long to come out.

I always appreciate restaurants that offer vegan or vegetarian choices.  I was able to get \"The Courier Breakfast\" (2 eggs, bacon, ham, or sausage, served with hash browns and your choice of toast) with vegetarian sausage patties.  My eggs over easy and German Rye toast blended well with the patties, and the hash browns were perfectly browned.  Add a small grapefruit juice, and bottomless coffee and my meal was just what I wanted.  I wanted the Almond French Toast too, but had to pick only one meal.  I'm not in the area often, but I would definitely come back.  I loved their selection of kids's book (see photo) if you have a child that needs occupied at the table.

Have been on a super-awesome-diet for a bit, now, though, so instead of my usual (the bacon cheeseburger (and even _I_ can't believe I found the strength not to order that one!!)), I decided upon a healthier option-- the trout with a visit to the salad bar.Disappointment, upon disappointment for this poor meal.  The trout was cooked in what was supposed to be a lemon-like sauce.  Now, normally, if I've had trout, it's either cooked crispy in the skin, or filleted out of the skin, and cooked in the sauce.  Not for this unfortunate creature.What I got was a piece of trout cooked in the skin, but steeped in the sauce, so much so that the skin had become rubbery and chewy.  The \"lemon\" flavor was so absent, that all I was left with was an incredibly FISHY piece of fish (which is never really a plus for me), in a gelatinous, plasticy skin.  I did my best with it, but it was a disappointment.  I have to expect that Courier has cooked harder dishes (with Silvercreek in the family!!), so... I don't think it was out of the realm to imagine they'd do a good piece of fish! The rest of the table was pretty happy, though.  My trip to the salad bar was less disappointing, but wilted lettuce, and the inability to get to the items I wanted on the bar (most of the healthy options are waaaaaaay toooooo farrrrr in the back, and grossly out of reach from the average grabber) made the salad blucky, too!

Salad bars aren't as popular or common as they were 30 years ago, but I am still a fan.  I've tried other things on their menu and enjoyed them-the desserts are excellent.  I like the Victorian decor, too.",

The floors are sticky and the bathrooms gross but Campus abounds in places with Orange and Blue ambiance.But when we want a good breakfast before the game, a really good burger after the game or an ice cream rush before the drive home, this Illini family heads to Courier Cafe, with nostalgic 70's decor and honest food.  For breakfast, I prefer the Courier, for lunch any burger plus the sweet potato fries and for ice cream, definitely the Misprint Sundae.  If you want fancier, head down the street to its sister establishment, Silver Creek.  For an off campus comfort food experience, go to Courier.  Tell 'em the Chief sent you.",

I ordered the peanut butter banana milkshake and it was the perfect amount of consistency! Some places either make their milkshakes too thick or too watery, but courier cafe's milkshake is perfection in my mouth! My friends and I also ordered the dipper. It was potato skin with bacon, sour cream, cheese, and green onions. I didn't expect it to be so delicious. No doubt, when I visit again, my combo is going to be a milkshake with the dipper. YUM!",

I have been chided by yelp message -- probably from the owner or his friend -- that it is OK to call a tortilla dish \"rarebit.\"  My feeling is that if you were going for a zany take on rarebit that an insider would get, no luck. I moved here from Britain. When I saw the tortilla labeled \"rarebit\" my reaction was: This place doesn't know what they are doing. Admittedly, the item on the menu labeled \"spanish\" is far weirder.",

Oh wait, that's because Old Chicago has NOTHING to do with the city of Chicago itself.  It's based in Boulder, Colorado.  This would explain why the \"Chicago-Style Pizza\" was...not Chicago-style.  Yes, it's pizza baked in a pan, with a thickish crust, but when the sauce is not on top, it's not Chicago-style.  GET IT RIGHT OR PAY THE PRICE (to quote a favorite childhood TV show).Moving on.  I perused the website before we went, and was excited to see that on Thursday nights, they have $2.50 pina coladas and strawberry daiquiris.  I mean, $2.50??  Hell yeah!  See below:http://oldchicago.com/champaign/specialsWhen I mentioned these specials to the waitress, she looked dumbstruck.  After checking with her manager, she came back and said all they had were margaritas.  I sighed and said, sure, I'd have a margarita.  When she brought it, she informed me that she'd only charge me $2.50 for that one, but nothing else, because they didn't do specials anymore.  I responded that that was fine, but maybe they should TAKE THE SPECIALS OFF THEIR WEBSITE?  I mean, just a thought.  Oh wellz, the margarita was gross anyway.The one redeeming thing about Old Chicago is that it has a ridiculous beer selection.  Like, in the triple digits.  I have to respect that.  Otherwise, this place is pretty mediocre.",

When someone wants the chicken Alfredo without the chicken and wants veggies instead, you don't charge extra for the veggies. It's called \"special instructions\" on the POS. Granted it only cost $0.99 for the   substitution, but it's the principal of the cost of chicken vs the cost of veggies. Also, the veggies they gave were shredded carrots and broccoli with one sliver (literally one) of red pepper. There are better ways of going about substitutions.",

In this trip I tried 4 different items.Chicago 7 pizza: Good thing about this pizza is that it was loaded with toppings (Green peppers, Italian sausage, red onions,  Pepperoni, mushrooms, etc.) -- but the sauce was a bit too sour and it could have used additional cheese. The crust itself was tasteless and too hard to chew -- not really what you'd find in any of the great Chicago pizza restaurants.Classic wings -- Light and crispy but really lacking in flavor and meat juciness. The dish itself is too dependent on the sauce to have any flavor.Molten chocolate cake -- Not really a lava cake but the fudge was nice and rich and went well with the ice cream.The big cookie -- Wasn't great, wasn't bad -- the oatmeal chocolate chip cookie dough was a bit on the dry side and ice cream is almost mandatory otherwise the dish is too plain.Overall, the prices aren't bad and the portion sizes are good but the execution of the food could be improved.",

The pizza was fairly good, not too saucy, yet still flavorful, especially for sitting out on a buffet under heat lamps.  The buffet selection is very small, but they change it out frequently (every time I went up, there was a different selection).  I don't know if it matches \"Chicago style\" pizza, and frankly I don't care.  I'm not here for a particular style of pizza, I'm here for good pizza.The kid's root beer tour is a very nifty idea.  Kids get to order different root beers (nowhere did I see a menu, but the one our server recommended was pretty good), and once they've ordered enough, they get a T-shirt.Speaking of our server, he was fantastic.  Our drinks never ran out, he worked well with our kids, and he was very friendly without being bothersome.",

Overall, the food is pretty good and the atmosphere is nice when it isn't completely crowded.  It is a chain restaurant, so don't expect unique gourmet cooking.  The 'Chicago-style' pizza is more like a standard thick crust pizza as opposed to REAL Chicago-style pizza.  Try Papa Del's or Amano's if you're looking for more legit Chicago-style pizza.All that aside, Old Chicago is a nice place to go with friends and/or family.  I have usually had good service, and there is a full bar if you want a drink or two.  The prices are a little steep if you don't go on Tuesdays though.  PROS: Cheap on Tuesdays, decent food, pretty good service, family-friendly atmosphereCONS: Pricey on most days, NOT real Chicago-style pizza, loud when restaurant is crowded",

First we had the trio sampler appetizer, the cicilian pepperoni roll is quite good, and the itallian nachos taste more like crab rangoon minus the crab stick, but that two was the best one for me. The pizza, taste okay, but I didn't eat the deep dish one, so I couldn't judge on the pizza. Lastly we got the captain's catch which was also taste so so, really didn't leave much impression on me",

The service, it just sucked no other way to put it, get the really big beer because a refill may not be in your future. This place is not cheap 3 beers cost as much as the pie.

I quickly hopped into my car and jetted to this location for my lunch hour. I was surprised to find that there was plenty of seating in the restaurant. Staff was super friendly and I was off to the races to eat pizza. Now the \"Rush Street\" pizza bar is 8.49 Monday to Friday 11AM to 1:30 PM. They give you a choice of salad or the two soups (tomato bliss or chicken green chili soup). I was took the tomato bliss, very rich tomato soup. I wish they had some cheese to go with it. I proceeded to gorge on the pizza selection and the calzone. My impression is that they don't have any deep dish pizzas which is unfortunate when you think chicago style pizza the deep dish is the cornerstone. Lots of other pizza selection from meat lover to veggies to hawaian. The calzones were prepared well. The pizza is super hot so let it cool down just a little bit before diving in. Overall the pizza is comparable to other restaurant quality pizza and a bit better than the chains (papa johns and pizza hut). They are not kidding when they tell you that this is for the rush hour lunch crowd. Before I finished my soup, the check was on the table in case I had to pay and run. Service was friendly. Also and FYI you can request pizza for the buffet. So all and all the pizza is relatively good quality, but missing a deep dish would have pushed it over the top. Finally the chocolate chip cookie is a bit too small and just a odd way to end the meal. You get just a small one...Pro: AYCE lunch pizza buffet, better than papa john or pizza hut, super fast serviceCons: No deep dish pizza, if it is not busy you may have a very limited selection. There was 4 pizza types and the calzones and breadsticksHidden gem:AYCE Lunch pizza buffet. For the pizza lovers",

                "review": "While browsing for a place to find dessert in C/U, I noticed that Old Chicago had 3.5 stars.   I blurted out, \"3.5 stars?  Who is writing these reviews?\"  Seriously, that guy above me, or that girl below, who gave this place 4 stars.  They don't know what good food is.  Don't listen to them.  Sorry, but it's true.This place is a blaspheme of Chicago as a restaurant city.  The owners should write an apology and make cash reparations to the city for besmirching its reputation and as a consolation for anyone coming into this place thinking they would be getting true Chicago food.First off, you walk in, and the obligatory Chicago street sign, for Rush Street no less, is in orange.  Orange?  I grew up in Chicago.  Not once did I ever see an orange street sign.  Black on yellow or white on green.  We have orange highway hazard cones.  Hmmm, strike one.  Onto the menu.  The restaurant was started by a bunch of guys from Boulder Colorado who had never even been to Chicago.  Well, that sounds like the kind of people you want dishing up authentic Chicago food, doesn't it? The pizza combos used ingredients that no authentic Chicago pizzeria would ever be caught dead using.  Pineapple?  Chicken?  Anaheim chilis?  Oh, and then there's the lame \"Chicago Seven\" name to try and tie it all into Chicago.  Otherwise, the pizza names resemble something  you'd find at California Pizza Kitchen.  And I don't mean California Avenue, where Giordano's, a REAL Chicago pizza place, was founded.   Strike two.The pizza got to the table fast.  I do mean fast.  When pizza gets to your table in 15 minutes or less, that means one of two things:  wood burning oven, or frozen pizza warmed up in a conventional oven.  I'll leave the reader to guess which choice is correct.  Taste test time.  I've lived on the north side and the south side.  I know what the different neighborhood pizzas taste like, and what a Chicago pizza should taste like in general.This wasn't Chicago pizza.  The crust was cardboard-like.  Chicago isn't world-renown for its thin crust pizza.  But those neighborhoods pizza places that focus on thin crust do it in a cracker-style.  Not cardboard.   The mushrooms looked canned.  The tomato sauce was bleh.  Strike three.Oh, and just for good measure, the spinach artichoke chip seemed to be devoid of spinach, but not of salt.They do have a good beer selection.  I assume this is so you are tempted into drinking enough beer so that you do not notice how bad the pizza is.Avoid.  Steer clear.  There is a Rosati's in C/U as of the time of this writing, and that is representative of a Chicago-style pizza.  Ironically enough, Rosati's is based in Chicago, not Boulder Colorado.  Old Chicago would be a good place to bring a group, if you wanted to drink, watch a game on one of the 2,382 TVs they have, and don't care about the quality of the food you are about to eat.POST-SCRIPT:  about three days after getting this review, I got an email from the marketing department of the corporate parent of Old Chicago.  Basically saying that they are sorry we were dissatisifed with the experience and offering a voucher for free food.  This is the saddest part of the experience.  It was obviously just a form letter.  The folks didn't even bother to read the review to see why I was dissatisfied.  Strike 4 if that is even possible.  A restaurant that is non-responsive to their customer's concerns is the worst kind of restaurant.",

Their new \"Tavern style\" pizza is basically a less-good version of their NY-style pizza (which they no longer sell).  Both mine and my friend's pizzas were really salty.  Wasn't impressed.One of my biggest food-service pet peeves is staff who don't know what they're talking about.  I understand that just because you work somewhere doesn't mean you have all the answers--but if you don't know something, you shouldn't just LIE to the customer.  I asked our waitress if the Specialty pizzas were included in the half-off deal for Tuesday nights.  She said yes.  We got our bill--which she checked before giving to us--and I paid.  Of course, after we left I realized that our bill was about $5 too high.  Because the 50% hadn't been taken off my pizza.  Because specialty pizzas aren't included in the half off deal.  Won't be back to Old Chicago--not a fan of how they've changed their pizza, and the mistake on the bill was enough to keep me from returning.",

                "review": "I was pleasantly surprised, though my expectations were low. They were lowered further by the atmosphere/decor. This chain restaurant is indeed offensive on many levels to a person from Chicago: typical corporate chain restaurant wall flair is everywhere, and that schlock is indeed Chicago themed. There is a scoreboard that looks like Wrigley's, a sign for Rush Street, and everywhere you look are old timey pics of landmarks etc. etc. This in and of itself would not be so bad, but the fact that the chain so buttfucks the idea of Chicago deep dish pizza is irredeemable. The thing that they call deep dish likely has most of the ingredient groups of a Chicago Style pizza, but it is so unlike a Chicago Style pizza I refuse to discuss it anymore for fear I will throw my keyboard in rage. A quick look at their corporate website and you will note that this place has dozens, if not hundreds of locations, with only one in Chicagoland (Elk Grove, on the Iowa side of O'Hare).So why does this patently offensive joint get an 'A-OK'? The thin crust pizza was pretty good. It was not New York Style, but the cheese had the same saltiness and was cooked to perfection: crispy, with slightly orange cheese, and served hot as hell but not yet burnt. I had it with basil and roasted garlic, which were chopped up and added under the cheese and complimented the pizza very well. Their Cheesy Garlic bread is absolutely divine; I have to get that again next time. They also have beer. Basically every mainstream domestic and popular import you have ever heard of. About 30 on tap. Not as many obscure micros and craft beers as you will find at the Pig and Crane Alley or even at Radio Maria, Boltini and Seven Saints, but it is a great selection for a chain restaurant. Kinda disappointing in that regard, but understandable as this is obviously a company that buys thousands, if not millions of barrels yearly and is not interested in getting a cask here and there.I went on Tuesday night, when they have 1/2 price pizzas and $2.99 Two Brothers' Beers. This made the meal much more palatable. My 14\" thin crust pizza full price would have been about $15-16 with 2 toppings, which is a little much for a pizza that feeds two (they say 2-3, but dont do that to yourself). Service was great. Jacob (Jake) was attentive, efficient, and accurate. He was courteous and intuited our needs. We were playing trivia there via the NTN boxes, so of course he always seemed to come by when a question was being asked, but that is just how life seems to work.They have a ton of TVs, most of which are flatscreen HD. They also have a bunch of very high quality video games including new golden tee and new safari hunter as well as a few others. This would be an excellent place to watch a game.So, the experience was pretty darn good, even if it was in an obnoxious corporate atmosphere. Prices would have been a little higher than is reasonable for Chambana, but I went on a night with a deal (check their website for that). Had a talented server, and that made all the difference.",

The location since changed to a different restaurant per property owners choice, which upset a lot of guests and staff. Now that I'm in Champaign for business over the next 6 weeks, I jumped at the chance to go in for a few of my favorites! Of course, since the last time I had Old Chicago food, the menu has changed... But for the BETTER! I went in thinking I knew exactly what I would order, but I found myself reading the entire menu trying to choose from the new, or sticking with my old favorites. I ended up choosing a favorite, the Chi-Town Trio (formerly, Signature Trio) which consists of small portions of the Italian Nachos, Cheesy Garlic Bread and the Pepperoni Rolls. I also took the Chopped Salad to-go for lunch for the next day. Aside from the menu choices, I had an excellent dining experience. Upon walking in I was greeted by the hostess who honored my request to sit at a comfy booth. I told her I used to work at an OC and she engaged in polite conversation about when and where. Awesome. Then my server Bradley was just so polite and courteous. Dining alone and totally beat from a long day at work as a restaurant manager, it was refreshing to have such great service. He perfectly timed out my dine in order with my take out order and presented my check just as I was about to ask for it. He even anticipated my thoughts and brought me a fresh side of marinara to take home with me for the last Pepperoni Roll and Cheesy Garlic Bread slice I had left. Needless to say, I'll be back over the course of my business trip. I can't wait to try some of the new entrees and snack on my old favorites. Well done, OC-Champaign!",

This time I actually did get a calzone, but it had the one ingredient I could not eat...the dreaded peppers. The bartender got her manager who informed me it was my fault because I wouldn't eat peppers...I kindly explained to her through clenched teeth, that I ordered the sausage and spinach calzone NOT one with peppers. I declined any further offers for corrections and left hungry in fear if a lugee being launched in my food. That was only my meal.My boyfriend ordered fish and chips (at a pizza place, I have no idea why). His one request was for coleslaw as a side, he never got it....even after multiple requests....big surprise. He was also looking forward to the savory vinegar described on the menu that would coat his fries...that was not present either, even after he asked again for it. To the managers credit, she did comp our meals (even though I never got one) and gave us a gift certificate for a future visit.We decided to give it another try tonight and ran into the same issues...slow service, wrong orders and being blamed when the wrong stuff is brought out.

The wait staff is well trained and actually competent; the bad news is that they can only serve what the kitchen prepares.Our orders:Appetizer for 2 - artichoke & spinach dip. Served in a round smallish soup type bowl, this awful tasting, white looking glop that looked to have been slopped in the bowl with a large kitchen spoon should have been a clue as to what was to follow. We didn't eat any of it nor we're we offered a refund on this unbelievably bad dish.Main course - \"Tuscan\" pizza, deep dish (what the hell. It's supposed to be a \"Chicago\" place, no?) We were lead to believe that, among other things, the pizza would be served with sauted spinach and chicken breast. What was delivered arrived with approx 5 to 6 leaves if spinach in the center and some rock hard \"chicken\" bites that I'd bet dollars to donuts was what's known as \"chunked and formed.\"Later that night I had, shall we say, terrible gastric distress.SO NOT VISIT THIS PLACE!!",

They had a Mexican thick crust which was interesting. I also tried the Stromboli and I really liked it. A soup or salad is included with the pizza bar. The server will bring you the salad. They make their own ranch dressing and that's a plus in my book. You get a chocolate chip cookie with your ticket. And it is really good. This is NOT Chicago style pizza. I'm not sure why they chose that name. Unless there is something I am not aware of. When I go to Chicago I have Chicago style pizza like Gino's. Now that's a Chicago style pizza!",

The lunch pizza buffet comes with soup/salad, the buffet which has breadsticks, some kind of stramboni things, and various mix of pizzas. they give you a choc-chip cookie for dessert. The pizza is good, but I wouldn't say it's the best in town, or \"chicago\" style pizza. The buffet sometimes doens't have any \"normal\" pizza up there. Ususally you can ask the waitress to request they make a certain pizza though. But sometimes they have some very weird stuff up there like cheeseburger pizza, pinapple and ham, or whatever they feel like on any given day. Also it seems they always want to put me on the farthest side away from the buffet as possible on lunch even when there are a ton of open tables around the lunch buffet (which most people get during lunch hours). I hate having to walk aroudn the entire bar to get to the buffet. I realize I could just ask to sit closer, but when I  tell the hostess 2 for the bufet, I almost want to see where they will sit me, and they always sit me the farthest booth away from the buffet as possible.",

A few days ago we stopped there for the 2nd time while in Champaign, and I thought the pizza was so good the first time that I ordered it again this time. My husband also ordered the same thing! I got an individual size thin crust cheese pizza with extra cheese and it's a great pizza. Hubby got the double mushroom swiss burger again. This thing is huge. My child got the pepperoni rolls and gives them a \"9\" on a scale of 1-10. The first time we were there our server was Josh, and he was fantastic. I used to be a waitress, so I always appreciate and tip good wait staff. I asked him questions about different things on the menu, and he was able to answer confidently. He refilled our drinks without being asked to. Checked on us multiple times. Just great service. Our waitress the second time wasn't so hot, but we will for sure be eating here again.",

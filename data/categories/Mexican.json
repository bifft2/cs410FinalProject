The combo meals are a great value- you can get a relatively authentic meal of two tacos, rice, and beans for $7 out the door, or a bigger platter (my choice was the burrito, enchilada, and tamale) for just a little bit more.Sure, the value and authenticity are great, but the one thing that will keep me coming back is the chorizo.  The really smoky flavor is among the best that I have had.  The chips and salsa (possibly made on-site?) are also really solid.",

Never before have I gotten so much food for so little. Not to mention, the food is amazing. Now granted, I have a very, very favorable disposition to Mexican food. But there's just something so wonderful about getting a massive burrito covered in queso in a flimsy to go box, accompanied with a small, greasy brown bag of complimentary chips and salsa (delivery). Overall, 5/5. This place is a hidden gem in my opinion.",

I ordered a Carne Milanese but was informed that they were out of that. I opted instead for the carne asada entre.Waiting for my order I noticed a couple things. First, that the inside of the place is dirty, old and not somewhere I'd want to sit down and eat at. Second, that Burrito King and Tortica's Grill are synonymous. The menu said Burrito King but the outside sign says Tortica's. My entre came with a whole bunch of stuff including the carne asada, rice, beans, 3 tortillas, pico de gallo with lettuce and guacamole and also chips and salsa.Unfortunately, I didn't think any of this stuff was very good. The beans were just OK and the rice, guacamole, chips and salsa were all sub-par. The carne asada was pretty awful. It was two very thin pieces of tough, flavorless meat that I was seriously questioning if it was actually steak. I had to put my own hot sauce on to make it bearable.I paid $11 for all this and was not satisfied with what I got. The portion size is good, but who wants a large amount of crappy food?Not this guy, 1/5.",

If you grew up eating Taco Bell, sometimes the craving comes back.On this location:The side door area kind of smells like urine but it is right next to the bathroom.  I've never used the drive through so I can't comment.Going in the middle of the day on the weekend I have never had a problem.  The food is Taco Bell - you know what you are getting.  I am partial to the beefy crunch burrito right now.  It's a burrito!  With spicy Fritos on it!  There are days when that's what you want.One time I had a very disorganized order, and the lady working the register organized it into value meals to save me some money.  I really appreciated that.I usually get my food to go.  Last time they forgot one of the tacos, but when I mentioned it they immediately made it up for me.  Then I took 12 Fire sauce packets as usual and left to enjoy it.",

As any TB frequenter knows, there are some of those visits during off peak hours where they have their JV folders on duty and the result is your food is just not put together well.  This location seems to only hire JV folders.  Another thing that is upsetting about this location is that their rate of getting orders correct is at best 1 in 4.  They constantly put beef on my bean burritos and put onions on the 7 layers.  If you enjoy interaction with crack heads, then this place is for you.  I have gotten harassed by other patrons who just yelled random comments at us, and this was during the day.  Also, one of the workers was definitely under the influence during one visit.  Just drive the extra 3 minutes and go to another location.",

They often forget to give me my drink or Doritos, but fix it without any hassle when asked.  The food itself I've never had an issue with; always pretty good.  Location is pretty convenient, even more so now that the 22 Illini bus stops right out front. Up until about a week ago, they had a bunch of \"out of order tables\" (broken tables), but recently they installed new menus, removed broken tables, and removed the railing for the wait line, so it's looking a little better, but the restaurant still isn't in that great of condition.All-in-all, for being cheap and reliably good food, i'll give it 3 stars.",

What I got was eggs that resembled real eggs in both taste and texture and cheese that also resembled real cheese in both taste and texture! What a surprise! The biscuit was soft and pillowy.

I stopped by here on the weekend for lunch after work and was surprised there was no line. The cashier was quick to take my order after I figured out what I wanted and the food came out as I ordered without any issue. This is what pulls up the rating to 3 stars as the food has sharply declined from taco bell and is now a lot more expensive. Crunchy tacos are no longer 0.79 cents but 1.29 now. A lot of the other items have doritos, fritos, etc which is interesting, but it does not carry over to tasting good. All and all as fast food I think I will pass from eating at Taco bell now with the higher prices and subpar food items. The parking lot is also very small which is another issue. Pro: Large selection of fast mexican food, quick service, friendly cashiersCons: Subpar food, very small parking lotHidden gem:Happier hour 2 - 5 PM 1 dollar regular freeze or medium drink. Value menu, although a lot of items are no longer one dollar.",

Never order here. Worst service ever.I've eaten at Tortica's more often than I would like to admit, so, this isn't my first time ordering from them. And usually I never have any complaints on them. Last night, I ordered a Milaneza Torta, they didn't have it, which was totally fine! They called me and I ordered a steak quesadilla instead. around 1 hour later, I finally got my food. Again, I've ordered here many times so I was expecting around an hour for them to deliver. When I opened up the container, it was a cheese quesadilla. So they got the wrong order, I'm fine with it, again, 'cause I'm easy going. No problem, I will just call them and get my right order in. Multiple calls over the course of an hour. Nothing. No answer at all. I checked the time and I know they are still open. I thought maybe they were too busy to pick up calls, even though it was only 12:30am. So! I thought, hey I will just call tomorrow about the mix up and maybe get a refund or exchange. Next day I called and they finally picked up. A lady answered, as I was explaining my situation, suddenly she went \"I can't hear you, sorry, bye, sorry\" and then hung up on me. I was like what the fu... maybe bad connection. I am wayy more forgiving than I should be. I tried calling back after that and from then on, no more answers. They either keep ringing to voice mail, or cuts short and goes to voice mail. So I think it's obvious they are avoiding my calls. Learning from this I will just pretend I lost $10 to the wind. Will never order from them again.",

The queso dreams are made of. The queso that makes the world go round. The queso that Burrito King smothers on everything...I love this place. Fantastic staff, good chips and salsa, big portion sizes, veggie options. And did I mention the queso? Whether it's 2 pm or 2 am, this is the place to be. And if it happens to be sometime in between 2 and 2, they have a bunch of different flavors of margaritas, but they are a little pricey. Tip for the wise (or drunk, or reaaaaally hungry): if it's one of those nights that everybody has the same great idea as you and the restaurant is packed, order your food to-go! They'll even let you snack on chips while you wait - the best.Another thing to note: The Burrito King truck only accepts cash. Don't get mad, don't cry about it, the restaurant is literally a block away. Seriously, don't cry about. Seriously.Five stars 'cause I'm in love.",

My friend and went there for dinner, walked in the door at 6pm on a Saturday night and the place was completely empty (first warning sign).  The staff is ambivalent at best. our waitress took our order for a Fiesta Burrito and a Fajita quesadilla.  And against our better judgment we decided to order a pitcher of margaritas (since it was only $15).  We had one question for our waitress, how big  the pitcher (like in how many ounces)?  Her response?  \"Look in here, it should say\" while she hands me back the menu.  To which I responded to her that the menu did not in fact list the size of the pitcher.  Her next response was that it was \"normal\" size and walked away. Our food came out 5 minutes after we ordered it, getting to the point of being \"too fast\" in my book (making me wonder how it was prepared, microwave?)  As the food was set down our waitress mentioned that the \"plates were hot\" (mind you she is wearing huge silver oven gloves).  I will tell you this, she wasn't lying, these plates were scorching hot, as in I could not even touch it to move it on the table. The food was at best mediocre.  My burrito was filled with greasy pork and covered in bland rachero sauce.  My friends fajita quesadilla was passable (though quite small).Finally the pitcher of Margaritas showed up.  I will say I typically do not have very high expectations for \"house\" margaritas, I'm expecting inexpensive tequila, but these margaritas didn't even meet those low standards.  They were neon green and tasted of pure sweet and sour mix, not a whiff of tequila was detectable in smell or taste.  My friend and I finished half a glass each of the concoction before we decided we could stomach no more. Our waitress took 20 minutes to come back and check on us . Upon learning that we were not satisfied with the margaritas she responded that she would half to speak to the manager.  She returned a few minutes later and said that she was sorry but that we would have to speak to the manager our selves when we went to pay (which you do up front).  Fine, so we go up to pay.  We get to the front cash register and there is no one there.  We wait 3 or 4 minutes, still no one there. We finally decide to look in the bar area and find the host sitting a table watching TV.  We point out to him that we want to pay, so he gets up to go man the cash register.  When we explained that we were not happy with that margaritas, he says he'll go get the manager.  Finally the manger comes out, we explain (in an extremely polite way) that we were simply not happy with the margaritas.  He thinks for a minute and tells us that he will give us half off the pitcher (mind you, we consumed less than 1 glass total from the pitcher).  At that point I was beyond arguing and just wanted to get out of the restaurant, so we paid and left.   A word of advice, take your money elsewhere.",

I was pleasantly surprised.The salsa and chips are consistently good (where some Mexican restaurants have bland salsa about 50% of the time).  My husband and I have ordered a variety of items off the menu and overall enjoyed everything we have ordered.  The fajitas have been nicely caramelized; the rice is the best we have had in town.  They are flexible with ordering.  I don't care for re-fried beans and they have been happy to let me substitute for rice or in the case of bean enchiladas, for a cheese enchiladas.  Other reviewers have said they thought the food was microwaved and I have never thought that.  Perhaps the quality has gone up since they were reviewed 6 months ago?I only get the flavored margaritas (peach, strawberry, mango) and have felt they had a sufficient amount of tequila in them.  Tuesdays and Thursdays are half price margaritas; any size and flavor.  Well worth the value!I have only two reasons for giving 4 stars instead of 5; relaxed service and dessert.  This is not a place to go if you are in a rush; the service is designed that way I believe.  While they get your food to you quickly, they do not rush you to finish by rushing the check.  I suppose you could ask them to go quickly; I personally never have.  In regards to dessert, we have tried to order the fried banana dessert three times and only been able to get it one time.  Once they were out of bananas; the other time they were out of ice cream.  The one time we did get it, it was fantastic however.My husband and I have switched from going to El Toro now primarily to Fiesta Ranchera.  Our only complaints are certainly minor in comparison!",

It is a big restaurant and we were here on a Friday night of Moms' weekend and we got seated right away. Yay!The chips and salsa were good and we ordered an additional appetizer.  The cheese quesadilla was on tortilla folded over some cheese.  It tasted like it had been heated in the microwave.  No sour cream, no lettuce or tomato garnish, no guacamole on the side.  Boo!  Who serves an appetizer like this?My daughter and I both had the Carne asada which was pretty much icky.  Thin, dry and over cooked  even though I had ordered it medium rare.   This piece of meat zoomed past medium rare ten minutes before they took it off the grill.   I thought if I could put it in the tortilla with some other goodies, it might be a bit more edible.   It took forever to get anyone's attention to fill our salsa bowl.  We were both bummed and had coffee and split a fried ice cream to cheer ourselves up.  Didn't really do the trick.  :(I won't come again, Champaign has other options that are better -  now I understand how we got a table so quickly.",

By the time my wife and I got there (a little late due to rain), the others were already seated and had ordered some appetizers -- chips & salsa and traditional guacamole -- which were quite good. We had a smattering of margaritas, tequila flights, beer and the Ladies Best Friend, which my wife really enjoyed. The drinks were outstanding.We were initially seated inside, but chose to switch to outside once the rain had completely passed and the tables and chairs were wiped dry. Five people had some sort of taco meal and I had steak Mesquite Fajitas. Everyone seemed to enjoy the tacos. The fajitas were not sizzling as one would normally expect. They were just okay.Service at Wedge was exceptional! Although the interior was already crowded, our waitress was attentive inside and remained so once we moved outside.I had not been particularly tempted to go to Wedge since tequila has traditionally upset my stomach. However, I did try some habanero tequila, which was very good -- with no bad effects!We were celebrating a birthday and the birthday girl got a free tequila shot after dinner. Not bad.All in all, we had a delightful evening and will surely return -- perhaps to try one of the many different dinner specials that Wedge has throughout the week.",

Music was quiet and more classical than I expected. The place is dimly lit, but it looks great.Not sure whether to consider it a bar with food or a restaurant with excellent drinks.",

The pickled vegetables I think I liked the idea more than the executable. Rice was bland. My dinner companion said his salad was just OK and didn't even bother to finish his margarita. The potato wedge appetizer was good and the aioli was nicely spicy.All in all, it was just ok. I'd probably go back, but I'm not in any rush.",

A U shaped bar, with a few high top tables, and a bit more private booths.  No TV's at the bar, which is saying something in this town.  I really like the vibe here.  Relaxed and cozy during off hours.  Though this small spot gets packed during the weekend.  Though the bartenders and waitresses do their best, and the food always seems to come out quick.My family and I found a seat in one of the booths.  A smaller menu, with a few aps, tacos, and a few entrees.  You can mix and match 5 tacos for $15.  I love the Pastor, and Chorizo tacos.  The Pastor has a great mix of fruity sweetness and heat.  The Chorizo has a really good kick.  Fresh as can be guacamole, and the black beans are so flavorful.  Certainly not your typical mushy flavorless mass of beans at most mediocre Tex-Mex places.The bar is well stocked.  I am not a Tequila guy at all, but the Margaritas here are top notch.  They make some really good cocktails with the several house infused Tequilas and a huge selection to choose from.Tasty food that is more than the typical Tex-Mex joint, good bar, good service, and an all around fun place for a meal and a few drinks in this wonderful, but small downtown.",

Now when we go they have too many servers that take your order and you never see them again or just don't come back to the table until it's bill time. I had the lomo tortas with a tequila Moscow mule. Don't order this at the wedge at the crossing. Sandwich is too thick and potato gets are never done all the way. The beverage was strong but all I tasted was tequila and lime. But if you see my pic I guess they couldn't fit the ginger beer because of the huge ice cube in my glass. It's gone down hill since it first opened. Of course. I'm sick of dining out.",

Unfortunately, things were even more disorganized than the last time. The host was very friendly and attentive, letting us know he would be able to seat us soon and that we can hang out at the bar until the table was ready. The fact that we were greeted by a host was a great improvement for me because last time, I felt the confusion with seating and lack of a seating host/hostess was a major problem. When we approached the bar, the bartender brought one of us a drink right away while the rest of us needed some time to look at the drink menu. This is when the chaos ensued. A bunch of servers needed drinks for their tables and pretty soon, the lone bartender was caught up mixing margarita after margarita which all must be made to order. Then, large groups of people decided to also hang out at the bar while they waited for seating. At this point, a kind bus boy took pity on us and decided to put our drink orders in but he was unable to use the register, leading to a long line of customers who received drinks but hadn't paid. Our table actually became ready before we could pay for our drinks! We had to wait to pay before being seated. I was glad, once being seated to be out of the chaos of the bar. However, our server was just as disorganized when he forgot to bring us water after my boyfriend asked for it on 3 occasions. We didn't get water until we were almost done with our entrees! After all that, the food was pretty good. I had a chili relleno taco which was crazy! and surprisingly delicious! But unfortunately a lot of it was a little bland. Maybe the disorganized service put a bad taste in my mouth.",

It is cozy and the atmosphere is lively. Servers were attentive and didn't mind our party being laid back about ordering. I tried a delicious aejo, the guacamole, and a pastor taco. The drinks are reasonably priced for the location and atmosphere, and the bartenders/waitstaff are educated about the drink menu. The guacamole comes in a very small portion but it was quite good (I found the chips to be greasy though). The tacos were tasty.. perhaps not as authentic as el charro or maize but decently priced at $3 for what you get (quite a filling portion and the taco was piled with lots of extras, including roasted pineapple and chile de arbol salsa--yum!). I'm not sure that I will be back immediately but it's a worthwhile spot to check out if you want something a little different for the area.",

The cocktails were expensive, weak and heavily watered down with soggy ice. Sangria was barely a few sips of wine in a huge glass full of watery ice. Menus were dirty and table was sticky. No free chips and salsa so don't come here expecting any, and the $6 order of chips and guacamole is not large enough to be shared. The patio was busy but the inside of the restaurant was about 1/3 capacity and service was very slow. Everyone seemed concerned with what was going on outside and not inside. The food was lukewarm when it arrived. The rice was swollen and overcooked. Small spoonful of black refried beans. Flavor of everything was okay but nothing special.The carnitas were shredded pork fried on an oily flat top and not large cubes of tender fried pork like every other Mexican restaurant. Portions were smaller and less tasty than prices would indicate. My dates fried egg chorizo tacos were also delivered without eggs and then we were over billed, causing us to hang around even longer an be late to our show. Total disaster of a dinner. We had heard bad things from friends but decided to try Wedge for ourselves and we regretted the mistake immediately. Our table of 4 spent ~$100 and felt ripped off.",

The bar tenders are cute and friendly with their own edgy styles. The wait staff, young and professional with good knowledge of menu items. I decided to give this place a try after reading reviews on it. It was a grey cloudy day and it had just finished raining, as cute as it looked, outside seating was out of the question. But just to let you know, it is available. It is a seat yourself place, So I plopped at the bar, quickly greeted and met with a drink menu. By the by, all cocktails are only $6 on hump day..  I love me some margaritas. The spicy pineapple margarita was my choice tonight and I had that to enjoy while looking over the menu. Finally decided to have the steak torta, carnitas taco, chips and ranchero guacamole. There was no stagnant wait time to place my order as the bartender was very attentive despite the semi crowded bar. It was about give minutes later, boom, my chips come out. The chips are a crunchy kind of good. There are three kinds of guacamole in which I ordered the chunky spicy kind. It was a perfect accompaniment with my drink and anticipation for my meal. Before I can get halfway down my drink and just as I got over the chips, tada... Here comes my food. The timing couldn't be any more spot on. The steak torta was very tasty. It was seasoned and moist with the toasted bread just crisp. The sandwich was pretty darn good. On the plate were also potato wedges that came with aioli dip. Without the dip, the wedges were.. meh. It's all about that dip. Done with my first drink, I gave the bar tender a nod and boom another one came. Completed my steak, on to my taco. The carnitas or pork, was a bit dry and it was just ok. Following the steak, it wasn't great. Finished it anyway, dipped it in the guac and poured salsa on it. That did the trick. Munched on the chips some more as I wrote this review. The environment is clean, friendly and inviting. The wait staff is awesome. The food is great. And the prices are reasonable. The music is trendy and relatively current. I would come back here again for sure. The restroom , sit or squat.   I give it a sit!",

I am so sorry I will have the GM call you back.\" I did not think anything of it at the time because I understand it could be anything.)I called, with no mean intentions, to inform them that I, as well as the doctor I went to see at Carle Clinic, were 95% positive that Wedge was the source of this foodborne illness, and the doctor assured me it was NOT the flu.  Wedge did not return my 3 calls until 3 days later, and the GM's response was that \"I'm pretty confident we are not the source. There is a bad flu going around.\" Thanks for the call. By the way, unless your steak always tastes that dry, then there probably was something wrong with it. Will not return again.GROSS!",

Our server was very friendly and attentive; she provided recommendations for drinks and food and she didn't rush us out after finishing our meal which I really appreciated, especially with it being such a pleasant summer night to sit outside.  We both went with the taco dinner-I chose 1 fish taco and 1 of their calabacitas (zucchini blossoms, yum!) tacos, while my friend went with 2 chicken tacos.  We also both got one of their lime margaritas.  The dinner came with refried beans, rice, and some pickled veggies too!  All in all, we were both pleased with our food!  The calabacitas taco was my favorite hands-down, but the fish taco was pretty yummy too.  I would definitely recommend Wedge as a great spot to sit outside, catch up with friends, and enjoy some Mexican food in downtown Champaign for a fairly reasonable price.",

I have been wanting to try it after hearing about all the different drinks and tequilas they had, but all that waiting was in vain. First off, I made a reservation, but was placed under a tent in  a parking lot on a 45 degree evening. It was warm when we first walked in, but were placed in the back where there were no heater lamps and the temperature was unbearable. We asked to be moved to a table closer to the one functioning heater lamp and were accommodated by the staff (although, in hindsight I wish we wouldn't have been so we would have gotten out then). After being comfortable for about ten minutes the lamp was moved to the back so we were freezing again, but by that point we were ready to leave. We ordered apps to start and got salsa and the ranchero guac. The salsa was good, but the guac was TERRIBLE. it was as cold as the wind blowing under the tent and despite the menu listing it as guacamole with pico de gallo and queso, there was no cheese visible or to taste and as many chunks of tomato and onion as corn (which coincidentally is not supposed to be in this version of guacamole). This led us to believe that they just made one large batch that they could serve as any of the three sub par renditions and stored it in a freezer all day. My drink (the diablo) was satisfactory. My boyfriend ordered the traditional margarita that included patron, patron citronage, orange liqueur and agave nectar. It tasted awful and they upcharged 50 cents for his request of Don Julio Blanco, which is acceptable, but then he was randomly charge $3 for Grand Marnier out of the blue. At that point it wasn't even worth dealing with so we paid and left. Their menu looks pretty good until you start tasting the food, but an individual taco is $3 and a platter of 5 tacos is $15...not a mathematician but that's not really a deal...actually it's not a deal at all. BOTTOM LINE: just don't do it. The food is wanna be upscale but is a flat out miss. The drinks are interesting, but seem to be a crapshoot depending on the specific cocktail.",

I was a huge fan of the tequila flights (I sprung for a Reposado flight my first time there) and they've got a bar full of bottles you can't get anywhere else. I've found it annoying that I can't get a plain old margarita in the past, and then I remember that I can get a glass of Riazul for $6 and I shut right up. If you're looking to do tequila shots with the limes and the salt and the children in Campustown, this isn't going to do much for you. But if you're looking for a nice place to sit back and enjoy tasting a spirit that people normally don't sip, it's awesome.",

Was this worth a \"date night\" with my husband ? Not really. When you have to pay for a baby-sitter a date night better be worth it! Wedge was more miss than hit for us, and while it wasn't terrible, it just isn't worth a repeat for us, especially since we can't really come here with our son - too bar-like b/c most of the tables have high bar stools. There are better (casual and pricy) places for a date in C-U. Pros:The server was great! Mixed up a fancy N/A juice for me since I'm pregnant. The fish tacos- very good- loved the sauce especially. But go easy on the cabbage!The steak tacos w/ poblano - good.Beer prices were reasonable.Meh: Tacos al Pastor - decent, but not worth a repeat visit, IMO. Guacamole - decent flavor- a bit too acidic, not enough salt.Cons: Chips and salsa are NOT free - it's $3 for an order!Beans - fresh out of a.... Can. So easy to make good beans, no excuses here.Guacamole price was high compared to other places around town (and yes, I know the cost of an avocado $0.90-1.79/each- esp owning the El Toros in town, I'm sure the owners get them cheaper than we can at Meijer. Price was $6 for a small portion that was *maybe*a single avocado. Seated right by the door - kept getting interrupted so servers could get liquor out, new patrons walking in - it was freezing! Forget a  nice date - we were cold and felt *very* rushed. If you want to get drinks and linger, or dessert, sit in the back. If you want a Jimmy Johns \"Freaky Fast\" experience, sit in the front. Carnitas taco - absolutely disgusting. It tasted like the meat was rotten. The nuts were whole and just didn't work  - would be better chopped up, but they dont' really add to the taco. This actually made me feel sick. My husband agreed.",

A group of friends and I chose to sit inside because outside was super crowded. Our server came to us, and asked us our drink order. She would not let my friend order a virgin drink, because \"sweetheart it tastes bad.\" My friend even said I do it all the time ( and we have done it before at wedge), and she still just shook her head no. Ok fine, so we stuck to water. Then it came time to put in our food order and all six of us ordered, and I ordered nachos. Ten minutes later our food comes, and one friend gets soup and I get tacos. I practically have to chase her down to tell her that no one ordered soup and I ordered nachos. She snatches away the tacos and soup and tells me \"sweetheart it will be a few minutes.\" I tell my friends to start eating, and 15 minutes later she comes back with ice cold nachos. Plops that down and walks away. It took you 25 minutes to get me nachos, but why were they cold?! On numerous occasions our server was just standing at the bar area, not doing her job! There were maybe 3 tables inside that needed service and she was exclusively an indoor server! Our water glasses were empty for almost 15 minutes before my friend kindly asked for a refill, and she looked at us silently, walked away, came back with a water carafe slammed that onto the table and walked away. Sweetheart, you don't go into the customer service business if you do not know how to provide even adequate customer service. Our server was just very rude, inattentive, and gave us major attitude for absolutely no reason. Another example of her incompetency, one friend asked for no sour cream with her quesadilla, our server answered with major attitude: \"you know it comes in the middle right.\" Meaning the middle of the plate, and so you can't just write no sour cream on your note pad?! My friend said I know, but the server just stared at her so when the time came there was sour cream on her plate. The best part of this whole experience was at the end our server was suddenly sappy sweet and told what a pleasure it was to serve us--ummm no you sucked.

The main dishes are tacos and there are some entree options as well as a nice selection of appetizers. I had one chicken (pollo, for your Spanish speakers) taco and one vegetarian of some kind. They were both pretty good. I would be interested in trying other items on another visit. Parking was easy. The best part of the meal was the margerita.",

The tacos where all very tasty and fresh and I even ate the black beans, which I usually stay away from, but decided to try them and was glad I did. The only bad part of the meal was the rice. Very bland and almost remained me of converted rice, oh well.The service was excellent and very cute, I might add. I will defiantly be going back next time I am in town.",

Our server, no doubt, was fabulous, but the food was completely subpar, especially when you have places like Maize, El Toro, or even Q'doba who seem to have gotten it right. Our guacamole left much to be desired. I make guacamole all the time, but this had a taste that it had been left in the fridge for a day or two, and was not a bright green color that would have indicated freshness. It was extremely acidic, but perhaps that was so you didn't realize the avocado was not fresh? The chips that supplied the guac were extremely flimsy, and not designed to be any kind of dipping chip, especially not with something as heavy as the guac. We did not ask for seconds.The drinks were strong but it felt and tasted like cheap tequila. It didn't settle well with my friend and I. The names are cute and they sure entice you, but I'm pretty sure the chef/bartender/owner has had no real experience with amazing drinks.The menu is surprisingly small, and they do tacos as basically their center focus, although there are some other things on the menu. I wasn't in a taco mood so I ordered the carne asada, and my friend the pork dish. The pork was good, the carne asada had a decent flavor, and the food came out fast. However, these plates were not worth $13. This same meal at El Toro or even at Maize would be cheaper and fresher. In summary, we were disappointed that we started our evening there, and even more disappointed when we left and went to Big Grove Tavern because for $13, they were serving roasted chicken and vegetables, something you know was high quality based on where they get their ingredients and the overall knowledge that their chef knows what they are doing. We give Wedge a year before it closes. Unless of course someone is brought in to give the menu and the chef a revamp so that people want to come back.",

I was so disappointed you had to pay for chips and salsa :( For the size I think it's a little bit overpriced - although it is understandable due to the location. The drinks? For a tequila bar I think the drink menu is underwhelming. I've tried the sparkling pomegranate and perfect patron margaritas - they're ok. I've had better and cheaper margaritas before.The nice thing is they have outside seating in the summer!",

Their fajitas, though, seemed old (not even sizzling when brought out, although still hot-ish). The meat was about 3/4 fat, instead of meat, so eating the fajita tacos was more of a task than enjoying a meal since I had to pull out the fat. I think if I go back, I'll definitely stick to the tacos. Tried the pineapple and mango jalapeno margaritas...the mango is definitely more spicy than the pineapple. Both were decent, though.---the Monday margarita flight is amazing!! Also, the Monday taco special is great. I'd definitely recommend getting tacos when you come here, but steer clear of the steak! The blood orange margarita is now a favorite.",

I have had only tortas and burritos but their meat is very quality; the chicken burrito I had today was pretty perfect, just the right balance of juicy chicken to avocado, rice, sour cream, and beans. The chorizo isn't amazing and I really wish they had carnitas; Fiesta Cafe is like the only place in Chambana that has it.The only problem with this place is that it's sort of expensive, relative to how much food you get (the burritos are maybe 30% smaller than La Bamba's, say) and the room itself is crowded and uncomfortable. The last couple times I've been there it seems like their air conditioning is broken. I would either order pick up or just get food to go.",

Amigos is pretty chill.  I had a delicious Torta Milanesa (Pollo), with just the right amount of cheese, avocado, and chicken.  The staff was quite friendly, and the while the service was slow, my torta DID come with a free Coke.  And my standards are occasionally low, so that garnered its fourth star.  I'll probably have to reassess after a second and third visit, but so far I haven't been let down.",

Positives: (1) The hot salsa our waiter brought us was to die for. Wonderful! (N.B. We had to ask for it--the mild salsa they give you when you arrive is bland and unappetizing).(2) There are televisions EVERYWHERE (but aren't TVs a sine qua non of Mexican restaurants?), which in itself is annoying--but the good thing about them is that they keep the sound either way down or off, the net result being that the restaurant is relatively quiet. And we like quiet.Negatives: (1) The chips were OK, but not even in the same league as those at Don Juan's (disclaimer: Don Juan's has made major changes to their operation, and we haven't returned since they did that, so any comparisons I make are to the old version of Don Juan's, which was for many years Mas Amigos). And El Toro offers only the one hot salsa, not two (plus pico de gallo) as Don Juan's used to provide.(2) The enchiladas were pretty poor tasting. I had cheese enchiladas, and they consisted of nothing but melted white cheese inside a tortilla (no onions), covered by a watery, translucent pink sauce that tasted (I do not exaggerate!) sort of like something from a Boyardee can. Neither my wife nor I could finish our enchiladas, and neither of us wanted to take home what was left.(3) My wife had something whose name I have forgotten, but it was flat like a chalupa and had guacamole on it. She said the guacamole was pretty tasteless. She couldn't bring herself to eat more than about a third of this item--and again, had no desire to take it home.(4) They offer only two kinds of taco filling--ground beef and chicken. My beef taco was acceptable, but not exciting, and nothing I would ever order again.(5) My chalupa was quite mediocre. I couldn't finish it, and had no desire to take the remainder home.(6) The menu does NOT show prices for drinks, whether soft drinks or beer or margaritas or anything else. You have to ask about every individual drink or brand to learn its cost.(7) Our waiter pretty much disappeared on us. We waited a long time for our check--he finally brought it only after we stood up and put on our coats.(8) The management wouldn't let us use the gift certificate to pay the tip. We've eaten at much classier restaurants using gift certificates--Biaggi's, Big Grove, Silver Creek (as well as at Mas Amigos when it existed)--and they all permitted us to pay the tip (and I like to leave large tips) out of what's left on the gift certificate. But not at this restaurant.We will never go to El Toro again. Our hypothesis to explain why we've heard good things about this restaurant is that our friends simply don't know what good Mexican food is supposed to taste like (FWIW, I'm from Texas and grew up on the stuff).",

The quality was decent, but overall the food left something to be desired--I find places like Maize and El Charro to be a better option if you're ok with not having a sit-down atmosphere.  Service was quite slow, especially given that it was the end of the night--it took at least 20 minutes for them to take our cash/cards after we were given checks.",

But, if you order carnitas tacos, you won't be disappointed.  Toro Loco is worth a trip, but only for these tacos.  The salsa lacks flavor, and if you ask for anything hotter, a warm, unappetizing bowl of hotter salsa comes out.  Margaritas are 1.99 on Mondays, and beer is reasonably priced too.The service is always friendly and reliable.  I wouldn't go out of the way to eat here, but seeing as I'm in the neighborhood, I'm glad Toro Loco is in town.  And I hope they never run out of carnitas tacos.",

Plenty of staff were manning the counters during a recent visit with my boyfriend, so our food was prepared in a timely fashion.  However, 2 different employees made our burritos, and I'd say that there was some inconsistency in technique: his was flat and floppy, mine was stout and compact.  I see the same differences at other made-to-order places (like Subway), so that might not be a fair criticism.In terms of complaints from other Yelpers about time and efficiency, I admit that Chipotle edges out Panchero's, but the additional minute or two required to put together a burrito didn't seem unreasonable.  The time delay might be more problematic during meal crunch times; not sure that Chipotle is much better considering their lines of 20+ students when school is in session.I can't complain about food quality, especially for fast food.  Tortillas are pressed and cooked at the time of your order, which is kind of fun to watch.  I think their rice differs from the lime-cilantro recipe, but I couldn't discern any specific flavor, either.  The grilled meats and veggies are tasty, and you are offered your choice of standard toppings: pico de gallo, corn salsa, tomato salsa, sour cream, guacamole, etc.  When I requested a little more rice or salsa, employees loaded up my burrito without complaint or extra charges.   Before wrapping up your burrito, they use small spatulas to mix together ingredients so that each bite is a \"perfect\" mix of everything.For local folk who don't have the patience for the student crowds in campustown, Panchero's is a fine alternative to Chipotle.  Prices, food quality, and environment are comparable.  Their fresh-made tortillas are a nice touch, but I'm not sure they make much of a difference in terms of flavor.",

This is reason enough to go here over the chains that give you a pre-pressed tortilla out of a plastic bag. 2) The taste is great, the food is usually very fresh. 3) The price is a bit cheaper than Chipotle. 4) You don't have to worry about the massive lines at Chipotle.Cons: The employees are awful. They clearly hate their jobs and are generally grumpy when you interact with them.I highly recommend Panchero's. The employees are pretty terrible, but the food is outstanding, especially the fresh tortillas, which makes all the difference.",

Not a fan of the \"tender\" steak or chicken. Veggies are good, it's a shame they cost extra if you want them included. I think in order to make this food taste good, you have to go heavy on the toppings and make it messy. I consider cilantro a food group all on it's own. It blows my mind that they do not have cilantro here for me to yell \"MORE!\" at them when making my burrito.",

It's a new restaurant that a lot of people want to try it so it's naturally going to be busier. Also, if patrons aren't familiar with the menu it's going to take them longer to make their decisions.

But in a world with so many burrito choices, I won't be going back to Pancheros.  The service was kind of slow but they did just open so we'll give them a pass.  They didn't have enough food prepared which forced us to wait while they made small quantities that they were bound to run out of again soon.  They said \"that's what happens when you cook fresh\".  I dunno, maybe I'm in the minority here but I don't really mind if my cooked veggies sit in a warming pan for a few hours.  Another thing about the food-they are VERY skimpy on the scoops!  I've never noticed this at Chipotle or Q'doba, both of those places ladle it on like they're fattening you up for market.  But this place was seriously measuring out very scant scoops of rice, beans, cheese, everything.  I got a burrito bowl and it was...maybe half full.  And yet I paid the same price as my husband who got a burrito which has a tortilla that the bowl doesn't include.  What's up with that?The parking here pretty much sucks if the place is at all busy and you enter through the Jimmy Johns drive-up lane so have fun maneuvering around the cars waiting in line.  The shared building with Jimmy Johns is just odd,  the signs for entering and exiting the parking lot only say Jimmy Johns, so it makes it seem like this place is a little tacked on.  Nope, won't be back.",

I don't think the portion size is as large as chipotle, and I also think the meat quality isn't as good either, but it was hard to tell as my burrito had a lot of rice. I did like how they mixed everything up before rolling, I feel that sometimes the ingredients are too segregated. Veggies are also extra whereas at Chipotle I do not believe they are. Panchero's might have a better quesadilla than chipotle, though. It was interesting to see how they quickly they heat it up like that!I was also a fan of the salsa verde, as well as the free sauce they have on the condiment table, surprisingly spicy and good.Overall I liked it but still think Chipotle might be better. I didn't know this was a chain until I looked it up, but it is. I was also given a punch card where when I buy 10 entrees I can get a free one. This might be useful if it was in a better location, at least for students!3/5 just OK but still way better than most fast/junk food garbage.",

The downside to that, is that there is always a line, but the staff is usually very efficient and courteous. It's hard to find a combination that is bad, but I definitely suggest more people try the fajita vegetables. It's a completely different flavor than a standard beans, much sweeter, but definitely delicious. Watch out for the Guac though; it's good but they charge you for it.",

The best thing that can be said about the food is, (a) Its not expensive for the amount you get, (b) It's unlikely to cause indigestion, and (c) If you've never tried mexican before, this won't turn you away forever.Otherwise, compared to many other mexican fast-food restaurants, this one is highly forgettable.  Example : L.S. (CA West Coast), much better, a 5-star fast-food mexican restaurant.  Example : R. (National), much better, a little pricier than the one above and salsas not as good, a 4-star fast-food mexican restaurant, and a publically traded company.  Example : T.B. (National).  Ok, it's not really mexican, but I enjoy their \"imaginary\" mexican creations, such as the 7-layer burrito and their chalupas, 3 stars.",

It is truly Food With Integrity, like their ads claim. And anyone who goes to Qdoba (greasy barf) is out of their mind.",

Frankly I'd take a tasty inauthentic chain restaurant burrito over some of the local flavorless grease bombs any day. I think the success of Chipotle is down to their very focused menu. They only serve burritos, salads and chips. They have chosen a narrow scope and do it well.Like most chain restaurants, it usually tastes better the when they are busier. I have gone at off-times and had less-than fresh ingredients served to me. Frankly though if they start scraping the bottom of the container of meat I imagine you could politely ask to wait for a fresh batch.I'm not a fan of grease and I enjoy the fact that the meat seems lean but juicy. That way grease isn't squirting all over your plate as you attempt to eat the burrito. Their chips are generally very fresh tasting and warm. They have just the right amount of salt. I'd recommend the guacamole as it's certainly better than I ever imagined it could be.There are better sit-down restaurants to eat Mexican in town. But if you need something quick to eat and are near campus this is a great choice over somewhere like Taco Bell.",

Why still four stars? Because it's delicious!

Burritos run about $6.50-$7, plus you can go for the upsell with guac, chips, and a drink and end up with a ~$12 bill, which is a little much for a meal in a fast casual restaurant.  The burritos are pretty big, but I can't say that I'm completely full after them, however with the calorie count, I really shouldn't complain.  Biggest downside to this location is that it's almost always busy; you can expect a 10-30 minute wait during lunch and dinner periods, and sometimes just randomly throughout the day.  Also, they aren't open all that late, so you can't satisfy those late night munchies with a Chipotle burrito :-(",

I only got the sofritas to avoid the meat options, not because I had an independent motivation to get them. Now, I can confidently say that sofritas are good in themselves. Whatever they're putting on these, it's ace.I tire of Chipotle, but that's only because this is one of the very few places that you can reliably eat vegan on Green St. It's also really convenient that they serve beans because you can up your protein intake.The lines get insanely long, so you should order on the app. You can set your pickup time to 45 minutes or more, so prepare to order ahead.",

Niman Ranch pork is ten times more juicy and delectable than the factory farmed version. It's also much more humanely raised and ecologically friendly. Chipotle braises the pork with pepper and other mild spices and the tender and flavorful result is what keeps me coming back all the time. There are lots of other options ranging from chicken to vegetarian, but in my opinion the pork is really the best. This location sometimes will give you a discount if you order just meat/cheese/rice and sometimes not...it's rather bizarre, but I think it depends on if the manager is around or not. I keep my receipts as a rather amusing record of how many times I have gotten the \"Ilini secret special.\"It's quite expensive as \"fast food\" goes and it gets crowded. I usually take mine to go, since every Chipotle I've visited has had a harried atmosphere that makes dining in unpleasant...but even if it upscale fast food, it's still fast food, so that's what I expect.",

My weapon of choice is a chicken burrito, but the tortillas are a little too thin. Maybe my add-ons are just too much, but the thin tortilla never makes it to the end in one piece.

I've been to them in Champaign/Chicago/etc.  They're great and deserve five stars.The problem with this Chipotle in particular- THE LINE.  Holy hell.  Everytime I would think to myself, \"I want Chipotle\" I'd look in and see a line wrapping around the building.  Of course I waited in it, but it took forever.  This isn't a one time occuring thing either- there is always a LINE.  I think it's because of the online orders, backing everything up. Either way, the food and everything is still excellent, it's just a long wait.",

I generally avoid campus eateries when students are here, but since it was much less crowded on campus a friend of mine and I decided to take advantage.I wanted to get a chicken burrito (as did my friend), but we were told it would be at least an additional 5 minute wait, so my friend chose steak and I decided to try the carnitas.  I was expecting something very flavorful, but I felt it was rather bland. I chose black beans, medium salsa (wish I had gone with hot now, because medium had no heat or taste at all), and cheese.  Perhaps it would have been better with chicken, but I would have taken a steak queso burrito from Qdoba any day.  I will probably give it another chance if I have the urge to go on campus, but the hype I had heard before going outweighed my actual experience.  Extremely loud, but you kinda expect that on campus.",

However, with the recent price increase for steak, I switched to chicken, and have been having Celiac-related issues ever since. I suspect that the chicken breast used in the chicken has broth injected to keep it moist, which may or may not contain gluten. I write this so that people sensitive to gluten can be on their guard, and so that Chipotle can re-evaluate their choice of supplier.",

I love that you can order Mexico style with cilantro and onion or American style with lettuce and tomatoes.  The quesadillas are overstuffed and toasted perfectly.  One quesadilla could definitely feed two, especially if you throw 1 or 2 tacos in the mix.  I've also tried the steak taco, American style and the chicken quesadilla.  The food is so fresh tasting and the meat tastes like real, high quality product. Another huge perk... The workers!  They are so friendly.  During our first visit, we were given some homemade pickled jalapenos to try.  They were amazing.  They aren't on the menu, so I'm not sure what to ask for next time I want them!  You have to try this place!  It's cash only and they will wrap your food to go if you prefer to not eat at the picnic table.",

There is an easy menu of flavorful basics: tacos, flour or corn, American and Mexican, tortas, burritos, and guacamole. Everything runs from $2 (tacos) to $8 for a massive burrito. But the star of this place is the elote.  Being from Chicago, elotes are a part of summertime. It's easy to make: cheese, corn on the cob, and chil but the flavors have to be just right to be authentic. And luckily for us poor central Illinoisians, Motorizado figured it out. For $2.50 you can enjoy this wonderful treat. They do go fast but if you come by at lunch, they usually have it. The service is quick. Just grab two sauces and a Jarritto from the shop next door and you're living the life. Heads up that there is no place to sit except one picnic table that might snap if you sit too long. It's definitely a part of the charm,  lol.",

I cannot speak of the burritos or the quesadillas because I've never had them. I stick to my tacos. I've tried all their tacos. My favorite are the steak and chicken tacos with a side of guacamole & chips.For Maize fans:This spot has better sauces, and is more affordable. If you want the maize taste just ask them to add cheese. You end up eating just as good if not better for a reasonable price.",

It was loaded with steak, veggies, and cheese. It was messy and fantastic. Easily the best torta I've had. The steak was in small bits and was great; some Mexican restaurants have chewy steak in their food, this was the opposite.I'm nervous putting this review up in fear the lines will stretch from the parking lot to the intersection of Prospect and Bradley, but I really want this place to stay open.See CT's review here ... http://champaign-taste.blogspot.com/",

The only problem our group had was when we found some dead mosquitoes in the bottom of the chips basket. But, after we ordered another helping 'easy on the bugs' that seemed to take care of that problem.  Would have probably grossed out some people, but were in college, and were broke, and it's free, so what can ya do? The food was good and cheap with a pretty generous serving and the staff was friendly and attentive. Bottom line: Good Mexican food if you don't want to make the trip out to Dos Reales on Prospect, but if you have a car, that trip is worth it every time.",

I don't like Mexican food to begin with, but I usually can be decently happy with meals elsewhere at the other Mexican joints like El Toro or Dos Reales.Pros:- cheap- open to 3AM- large menu- great chips and salsaCons:- workers didn't understand english well at all.  Had really difficult time ordering- Food came out wrong, for all of our entrees.  I had ordered a chicken entree.  I hate cheese on my dishes and the entree's description did not list cheese, yet it came out smothered in cheese.  To be honest, the cheese was what ruined my meal.  It was extremely salty and i hated the taste of it.  I also asked for no beans, but I got them too.  The other entrees had similar issues.- Way to salty.  Mostly the cheese sauce they use.  Disgustingly salty. - really tiny inside, only 10 or so tables.  Huge line in store of people waiting to sit down.  We originally were going to eat in, but had to order to go.... but a table opened up while we were waiting after about 15 minutes.All and all, I felt the meal could have been really good, but really this place gets the low rating because of the bad service.  Had our entrees come out right, this could have been a totally different review.  They didn't though, they came out very wrong, and I felt asking the workers to replace the error would have not gotten correctly communicated anyway due to their lack of English. I probably just hit it on a really bad day, but I won't be going again.",

Spicy food seemed like it'd be good for congestion, and I hadn't tried Torticas.  Well, Torticas was closed, so I continued down Green Street to Burrito King.  I remembered how the reviews were kind of mixed here on Yelp - either really high or really low - and decided to check it out.The good: The server was quick and polite, and I had horchata right away.  And a basket of chips, which were the best part of the meal.  The prices are pretty much in line with a campus place, maybe a bit cheaper than some..The rest: I tried to order a torta but I guess they didn't have any.  I ordered the fajita burrito instead, because it's in the name and since I didn't see anything about cheese sauce in the description.Comes out with cheese sauce.  Smells kinda strange - almost like plastic?  The veggies just taste weird and are not crisp at all.  The meat is chewy and also has that weird taste that reminds me of plastic or chemicals.  Cheese sauce is really no good - salty but not much else in terms of flavor.  I ate about a third of it, trying to make sure I didn't just get a bad bite or something, but it tasted strange and unappealing.  Other than the weird flavor, it was pretty bland - and no hot sauce on the table at all, which is weird for a Mexican restaurant.I like Taco Bell (sometimes) so the food smelling like chemicals isn't always even a deal-breaker.  However, I also like Mas Amigos and Taco Loco for their cilantro and onion tacos and spicy flavors - and would definitely recommend them, or even Taco Bell, over Burrito King.  If you like food like Mas Amigos and do not want the most midwesternized Mexican I've had, then don't go here.",

I would think they would check these things before they gave it out, but they didn't. The prices are okay and comparable to other places such as Chipotle or Maize. I will be back again.",

The menu at Burrito King is very similar to Dos Reales, and they have same drill of greeting you, taking your order, and throwing some chips and salsa at your face... lovely. I thought the place wasn't too bad. It was a little cramp but hey, it's Green Street. I thought the mexican rice was flavorful... I didn't really touch the beans but my chicken chimichangas were pretty tasty. Maybe it's because it's a deep fried burrito. I mean,  anything soaked in fat is tasty. Anyways, I wouldn't mind going to Burrito King again. Plus it's a nice walk from campus.",

Fantastic staff, good chips and salsa, big portion sizes, veggie options. And did I mention the queso? Whether it's 2 pm or 2 am, this is the place to be. And if it happens to be sometime in between 2 and 2, they have a bunch of different flavors of margaritas, but they are a little pricey. Tip for the wise (or drunk, or reaaaaally hungry): if it's one of those nights that everybody has the same great idea as you and the restaurant is packed, order your food to-go! They'll even let you snack on chips while you wait - the best.Another thing to note: The Burrito King truck only accepts cash. Don't get mad, don't cry about it, the restaurant is literally a block away. Seriously, don't cry about. Seriously.Five stars 'cause I'm in love.",

I order from them a lot and my experiences have been a little mixed but for the most part yum-yum-yum satisfaction.Pros:- Most of the food I've ordered from them has been super delicious. Can't speak to authenticity but I sure can speak to how much I enjoy putting it in my mouth. Especially like the chile relleno, the tamales, the salsa*, and anything involving the cheese or ranchero sauces.- Good beverage options. Love the horchata.- Really reasonable prices. For most menu items, the portion sizes are quite large.- Service is really friendly, which matters to me, even if they aren't always perfect.- Open late.Cons:- Sometimes the tortillas on my enchiladas are not very good, kind of stiff and dry. Not sure if they are stale as another reviewer suggested, or overcooked, or if it is something to do with sitting around in the to-go container for too long. The shredded beef and chicken are also not quite up to par with the rest of their food.- Have had occasional issues with service -- communication difficulties, missing complimentary salsa, a weird Campusfood.com-related snafu, trouble finding my easy-to-locate apartment door. All pretty minor and rare though.A note on delivery: all delivery orders come with complimentary chips and salsa, but you get a ton of chips and only a little bit of salsa. You can order extra salsa as a side, though, as well as the cheese sauce. Those two mixed together = heaven.* It's very cilantro-heavy, which I LOVE but I know there are some genetic mutants out there who taste cilantro differently. If you are one, this isn't for you.",

My enchiladas were o.k. but I wasn't expecting them to be anything spectacular. A lot of Mexican restaurants here don't use real cheese and thats a big pet peeve of mine. They were like Dos Reales enchiladas. So now that the Dos Reales on University is closed (the new place is still good, but a little more expensive, and they charge you for extra tortillas, and they only give you two, wtf!!!!),give Burrito King a try, they're good, cheap, close to campus and they deliver!",

Fast forward 15 years or so to Champaign. College student me, with no car, had hankerings for Mexican food during the day or late night. Options? La Bamba's \"burritos as big as your head and later on Chipotle (yea I know, another bastardization, but still crazy delicious).Oh, let me just make a point of it to say, I don't care how drunk you are, La Bamba's is one of those terrible life choices you can ACTUALLY regret -- my friend ate an entire burrito, walked outside, and threw up a burrito as big as his head.On to Burrito King. As the name implies, the ethnic owners clearly were not wearing their creativity caps, and were also misinformed on the lameness of copying the name of some big American fast food chain like so many other restaurants have done, e.g. Pho King, Egg Roll King, Gyro King, etc. etc.But the food? Absolutely fan-fcking-tastic. To start off with, I came in around 4 p.m. on a weekend so nobody was dining. The wait staff promptly set me up with a heaping pile of homemade nachos and salsaI had the pork tamales covered in a creamy white cheese sauce and chorizo all over. They came with a side of rice and beans, delicious. Please PLEASE try the homemade habanero hot sauce. I only wish they would sell me some, although they did get a to-go sauce cup for me to sip on later ;]The menu has scores of authentic Mexican dishes, including some run-of-the-mill options, but you'll find it all incredibly fresh and well made.Prices are cheap enough to make any future stop in La Bamba seem like heresy now.I wish Burrito King had come sooner when I was actually at UIUC, but learn from my mistakes and go check it out!",

Plus, the burrito was HUGE and came \"wet.\" The chips were light and fluffy and obviously homemade, and the salsas were delicious. I have been stuffed since lunch today and don't think I have room for dinner. Honestly, I can't imagine how large the Burrito King is, you would have to be a very large person to eat it I think (and I have a BIG appetite!). I really want to try the other dishes on the menu because they have a lot more than just burritos. They also deliver it turns out, so I will likely be eating a lot of food from this restaurant.",

I love everything I've had on the menu and I love the rice so much I wish I could get the recipe...I don't think I'll ever eat a Mexi rice I love more.   Good sized portions - note, if multiple people want a side of rice, just order one....it's massive (did I mention I love the rice?)I've said this about my love for Monical's pizza and same goes for El Toro...I live in ChiCity and have yet to find a (non-fancy or specialty) Mexi place here I like better.  I'm sure some would say I'm crazy...I don't care!  YUM!Their service is the FASTEST I've ever seen.  Which I know could be a good or bad thing depending on what kind of experience you're looking for (again, the 4-star thing) - but if you are HONGARY this is the place.  Chips and salsa on the table as you sit down.  Someone ready to take your order/answer questions immediately.  Water glass never goes empty.And last but not least, so very reasonably priced (I shouldn't say this but it's cheap actually!).  3 of us can eat there for less than $20 and that includes my $3 big margarita!I wouldn't come here as an 'experience' outside of the great food and quick service...meaning you might want to go somewhere else on a first date or with friends if you're looking for atmosphere.Only other thing, is that they can be heavy handed on the salt....",

I also participated in drinking a margorona while there with my friends. They're pretty darn big!! And are as tasty as the ones down in Mexico I will probably visit this restaurant again.

Lots of flavors (though the original lime is the best) and STRONG.  They really load these drinks with the tequila, and I like it.  I honestly would go here just to grab a margarita. As for the rest of the deal, the restaurant is huge inside, clean, and nicely designed/decorated.  The service was good.  The food though was very bland.  I only went once so maybe it was just a bad night, but my parties and my entrees all looked delicious, but tasted very bland.  Even the salsa, chips, and other dips were all really bland.  I never knew that food that looked so good could be so bland.   I probably would not go back again for the food.Definitely check this place out though for the margaritas, you won't be disappointed.",

(Disclaimer: I grew up in the midwest, but I have traveled and had Mexican and Southwestern food, and I've enjoyed trying the many Mexican themed restaurants in town.)  Chips were okay - crispy and pretty tasty.  Salsa was okay.  Chips and salsa were, probably, the best part of the meal.  So, +1 star for chips and decent service.My girlfriend wasn't feeling well, and wanted something lighter and got the guacamole salad.  What she received was a plate of iceberg lettuce, shredded white cheese, and very salty guacamole.  The guacamole tasted like it came out of a jar.  The combination was exactly as appetizing as it sounds.I got a burrito plate.  The burrito was not wrapped up.  It just had some filling dumped into it and had been shoved into an oven, so the edges of the tortilla had become hard and browned.  It was impossible to pick up and broke into pieces when I tried.  The filling itself consisted of stewed, mushy beef with stewed, mushy tomatoes and onions.  The sides were forgettable.   I really hate to throw away leftovers, especially if I think they can be jazzed up somehow, but that's what I ended up doing with the rest of the burrito.You do get a lot of food on your plate, but if it's bland Mexican that's very, very reminiscent of what you can get out of a box at the supermarket, why bother?  If you'd like better Mexican, try Huaraches Moroleon or Mas Amigos.  Or Taco Loco.  Cocina Real and Dos Reales aren't my favorites, but they're still better than here.  (I haven't been to Maize and can't comment on it.)  If you wish there was a Burrito King off campus, this is pretty much it.  Except they do, at least, leave off the salty white cheese sauce here.  Overall, I would avoid this place and go to one of many places that is cheaper, more charming, and more authentic.",

A few notes:The place is fairly big, but the parking lot isn't, so if you pull up and can't find a spot in the lot, you can find some parking on-street parking and will still be able to get a table once you go in...don't quote me though!For the most part the waitstaff's 1st language is Spanglish, so be prepared to talk slow and point to what you want.....I don't think I ever had an issue with lack of communication. Additionally  they may be a server short at all times as they are always running around trying to serve and do not fully spend as much time at the table to ensure accuracy of orders (especially special orders, etc.). My last experience the food was just alright....maybe a tad bland and lackluster. I usually get the Alambres dish...but strayed this go round....I'd highly suggest trying the Alambres dish to anyone and will probably stick to that. I usually get the mix of steak, chicken, bacon, peppers, and cheese with the usual sides...comes out like fajitas....sizzling and ensuring it'll be nice and hot.The drinks are alright, but I think are a little too expensive for the alcohol content.I think they would benefit from an aggressive happy hour special with extended hours everyday...something to help them stand apart from all of the other competition in town which may have a slight edge in the flavor/authenticity department..Nonetheless, El toro is a solid place to go.",

Maize tends to steal the spotlight, but if you're looking for a great restaurant that actually fits more then 5 people within its premises, I recommend El Toro.I went with two friends, and experienced friendly and quick service, superb cuisine, and fantastic sangria. The atmosphere is what you would expect from a family owned Mexican restaurant. It's my new go-to sit-down Mexican place. The only problems - I do not recommend ordering for pickup. The quality was compromised, but this is nothing new for any restaurant. Also, the other location of El Toro is not even half as impressive as this one. Perhaps the quality gap was due to the fact that I went to the other location with a party of 8, and the restaurant was very crowded, but I would rather order taco bell than go back to the other location. PS - if you can find yourself a DD, I highly recommend getting one of the Grande margaritas - they're literally as big as your head.",

                "review": "So we decided to try out the new El Toro since I had a coupon, and they were open decently late on a Saturday (11 pm).  The first thing a little odd about the place is that their are 2 entrances, but only 1 is really an entrance; the other you have to walk through the bar area to get to the other entrance to be seated (why not just have 1 entrance then?). The ambiance of the place is pretty nice.  It's not your stereotypical mexican restaurant, the decor is a lot nicer/classier. Unfortunately, they weren't playing mexican tunes, and instead we got the likes of Miley Cyrus's Party in the USA and Justin Bieber's (OMG!!!) Baby; not really what I'd expect/want to hear in a mexican restaurant. The menu is typical mexican fare; the only thing that annoyed me here was lack of pricing on the drink menu.  The margaritas are fresh blended, which can be a little annoying sitting close to the bar, and margaritas prepared this way tend to be a lot more liquid than frozen.  The medium size was on sale for a still expensive ~7 dollars.  The strength was about average, nothing too impressive.  So my biggest complaint is the waitress. We were seated right by 2 other tables that she also had, so she walked by us every couple of minutes, but seemed completely oblivious to us.  We had all ordered water at the start, and we were all out of water well before the time our margaritas came. She didn't notice.  Not even when she brought our margaritas did she care to ask if we wanted refills.  Finally, when she did another pass, I asked for a water refill; she only grabbed my glass and refilled it (even though everybody else at the table was also empty).  So, when she came back, another person at our table asked for a refill. Not getting the hint, she then just grabbed his glass and didn't think to ask anybody else if they wanted refills, luckily the other person at the table spoke up asking for a refill (as a waitress you really should be checking these things).  Same thing happened with Chips and Salsa; we were empty for the longest time, and only once we asked did we receive some more... unfortunately it must've been the bottom of the bag/basket since they were pretty much all crushed.  On the plus side, their salsa is definitely the best we've had in the C-U area... the chips weren't quite as good.  And if this wasn't enough, we also had an issue with our food order.  One of the guys at our table ordered 3 enchiladas a la carte.  When our order arrived, he only had 1 enchilada.  We asked the waitress about it, and she claimed that she thought he had only ordered 1 enchilada.  But, when she brings us the check, she clearly wrote (and tried to charge us) for the 3 enchiladas.  Surely, you would check something like this before delivering the bill (or when sending the food order to the kitchen).  Also, despite the fact that we were clearly 3 unrelated people, there was no offer to split the check.  I guess I'm giving it 2 stars simply because the food was decent, and this one waitress is hopefully not a reflection of the rest of the wait staff.",

I ordered two enchiladas with rice and beans. The dish did not come with sour cream or a little bit of guac or salad. Just enchiladas, beans, and rice. The tortilla used for the enchiladas was too fragile and broke apart with a light touch of the fork. Sauce wasn't that great either. Spanish rice was disappointing as well - too salty and therefore could not consume. Their horchata is a 2/5 since it did not taste like any that I've tried at other Mexican restaurants. Won't be coming here again unless forced by group consensus.",

Any other states Mexican food is like a fancy Taco Bell(except this awesome place in Queens). It just doesn't compare. With that being said, I'd say I liked this place. Not loved. Liked. I was seated quickly and was immediately brought chips and salsa. After a few minutes, I met my server and he took my drink order. The menu was large. I wasn't too hungry but needed to eat to avoid a headache later. It was hard to pick since all the items sounded huge. Which is great seeing how good the prices were. I was honestly amazed at their queso. Any time I go to an out of state Mexican place, they either 1. Don't have queso and loom at you like you're crazy when you order it or 2. It's from a can or the same stuff they put on your nachos at ball games. But this stuff was great. I ordered the flauta plate. Like someone else said, it arrived in 5 minutes. Strange since this was a sit down place. I would expect flautas to take at least 15 minutes to arrive. So this makes me think they were made earlier and were kept in a batch under a heat lamp. Even the family of four next time got their food in less than 10 minutes. Hmmm. But regardless, they tasted good. I brought home half of them and the rest of my rice, beans and queso. And for $10 before tip, that's pretty good to have that much leftovers. I'm giving it a 3 just because it was better than I expected and it was quick. But the servers were emotionless and socialized a lot. They were nice but didn't really smile or ask anyone how their food was or check on them. It seemed like they didn't want to be there.",

I have eaten at the various incarnations of El Toro for ten years, some pretty good, some not so much, but this was my first visit to the new Neil St. store, and it is really very nice.Service started fine, party of one, not busy, several Hispanic male servers on the floor, but I got the girl.  Burrito arrived promptly, but the beans and sour cream in the menu description were missing.  The girl thought the beans might be in the burrito, and brought SC immediately.  If beans were in burrito, they were well hidden.  Conference between girl and waiter yielded a \"side\" of refritos on a 12 inch oval platter, easily a serving for four.  Spent rest of lunch wondering how much I would be charged for beans that were supposed to come with meal.  It was only $1.75, so no drama.  Original girl had gone missing, so not sure who I would have complained to in any event.  Ten minutes is a long time with dirty dishes and a credit card on the table to get permission to leave.    Incidentally, the meat in the burrito was round steak, lean, tough, dry, tasteless.  I often buy skirt steak at the Mexican grocery, and make my own carne asada.  This was beef and peppers, in a tortilla.  Not terrible, but not great either.  Back to Taco Loco for my burritos from now on.",

The food was pretty standard (I got the cheese quesadilla and asked to get vegetables added and our waitress was able to accommodate my request with no problem!) and the prices were very reasonable (I paid $13 for my quesadilla and a good-sized margarita, tip included).  In regards to their drinks, the servings are VERY generous! Our party enjoyed a range of their margarita selection, spanning from lime margaritas on the rocks to mango-strawberry frozen margaritas and everyone was happy with their drink of choice.  We all went with the Jumbo (or was it Grande?) size (the equivalent of a medium) and it was definitely bigger than expected, but great nevertheless!Not the best Mexican food I've had, but it was a great place to meet up with a group.  I have a feeling that I haven't seen the last of El Toro!",

The lobby does still have a new paint smell that was off-putting, and that odor did occaisionaly drift into the dining area, but it did not affect my enjoyment. Despite what other reviewers have noted, I found their menu to be pretty expansive, going far beyond the 'typical Mexican restaurant' fare. The one thing I wanted that they didn't have was a Mole sauce, but most places don't so no big. They had a strong selection of liquor and tequilla, and pretty good drink specials. I enjoyed my enchiladas del mar, and everybody else liked what they got, too. The tamales entree was a hit. They give you warm chips and salsa that is good but pretty mild. I knocked ours up a bit with the Cholula and Tapatio they put on the tables and was sweating gleefully in no time.I wanted to try their Margarona, which is a margarita with a corona stuck into it. I know, it sounds gross to mix beer with liquor, but if it is done right, it can be surprisingly delightful. Holding me back from ordering this frankencocktail was the $8.50 pricetag, but If it were on special, I'd definitely take a Margarona behind the bleachers and deny it later.",

The margaritas are awesome and the service is great; I can always ask any of the guys for help and they are there right away. Also, I should point out that if you have NOT had real Mexican food, you will end up ordering the typical American disgusting version and will be dissatisfied.

Where are the tomatoes?  The chips taste similarly store-bought.- The guacamole had no personality... maybe they couldn't get fresh avocados?- The cheese inside the quasadilla tasted really off.  Were they using American cheese or something?- The tacos from head-to-toe were just not great, from the shell to the meat.THE GOOD:- I did like the horchata.  :)- Despite the ickiness, I left pretty full, so large portion sizes with reasonable prices.- It had the ambiance of a taqueria, but was cleaner.- Service was fast and efficient.",

Sitting on their patio getting schnockered on margaritas is a fabulous way to spend a summer day, and, oh yeah, the food is awesome.  When they mentioned they were moving, I was understandably nervous.I shouldn't have worried.  Their new building, freshly renovated, is gorgeous--and only two blocks from my house.  (Can you say 'stumbling-distance'?)  The bar area has less seating, but over all, the seating seems to have expanded.  The dcor is much more understated and less kitschy, which makes the whole place seem classier.  The outdoor seating area hasn't opened yet, but it looks fabulous, with several glass doors separating it from the inside, so even if you prefer to eat indoors, you can still enjoy the summer sun with your margarita.The food is consistently good and very fast, and the margaritas are strong.  It's no longer on the menu (the owner told me they are redoing the daily specials), but the Paisa Burritos are delish.  You can't really go wrong with chorizo-stuffed tortillas slathered in cheese sauce!  I also tried something new: a Margarona.  It's a frozen margarita with a bottle of Corona up-ended into it.  Trust me, it tastes better than it sounds, and it looks really bad-ass.Two small nitpicks: a distinct lack of parking during lunch--after 5 you can park across Williams Street at Bacon & Van Buskirk--and during the busy times (Saturday nights, for example) the food and service is much slower than at their old location.  I hope this is just them working out a few kinks in the kitchen and they'll return to their speedy service in time for me setting up camp on the patio this summer!",

Neil (right next door to Kamakura), the restaurant has 6 options for seating (or at least they WILL once the outdoor seating is in place), large, spacious rooms, and good decor. The drinks are strong and generous, the food is fresh and i think MUCH better than the old Neil St Location, quick service, sporting a mixed and interesting crowd of students, yuppies, sport fans at the bar and families.GREAT location, well-designed and reliable, cheap excellent food.",

When our meals arrived via a different waiter the food was all lukewarm. My chile relleno was so small and unrecognizable I thought they forgot it. It consisted of small flat piece of pepper covered with a tasteless sauce and some sort of cheese. The tamale was cold, filled with unseasoned ground beef and quite tasteless itself.  We never received our check until we stood up to leave. Then our waiter magically materialized, for the first time since taking our order over an hour earlier. Try any other Mexican restaurant, even Taco Bell, before going here.",

I was happy to hear that this opened up as it is closer than Chipotle on Prospect. Someone should be fired for the design and layout for the restaurant. I placed my order through the app which was quite easy to use, however when I wanted to place a second order for my wife, my credit card was rejected due to similar transactions so I decided to drive out to the location and order it in person. First the parking lot before Brixx pizza opened was a disaster. Super tight parking spaces, one way for traffic to go. It was a nightmare trying to park my car. Next you go in and order your burrito like Chipotle. For one of the orders I did not want cheese and the both of the other burritos did not need lettuce. Somehow I ended up with cheese on the one I didn't want and lettuce in both. One person trying to get the order for two burritos should not be difficult. Staff was not friendly at all and said why did you not tell me earlier. I got to the end of the line and paid. I also picked up my online order. There was a big box that was sitting in the middle of the table without any heat lamp. If you order too early, your burrito maybe stone cold when you come to pick it up. I did get a ridiculous amount of tortilla chips enough to feed 6 people. The salsa station is great as there is quite a variety and the spicy ones have quite a kick. The final straw was when I brought the food home, my wife and sister in law had burritos that had probably 3-4 oz of meat only. When you looked at the burrito after a bite all you could see was the tortilla skin, small amounts of rice, lettuce, and a sliver of chicken running down the middle. I wish I would have paid attention to how they made the burritos, but they were quite disappointed. All and all this is a big bust!Pros: online ordering app, Monday' 5.95 all burrito special, free tortilla chips and salsaCons: crazy small parking lot, apathetic staff, small amount of protein portions, no heat lamp for online ordersHidden deals: 1. Free chips/salsa2. 5.95 any burrito special on Monday only3. Sign up for e-club to get free queso for your chipsHealth code rating: A, appears clean and new. No health reports online at this time.",

You get free chips and salsa with any order, you can get discounts depending on the day of the week, and I love their queso.  They also have several items on the menu more in the style of Taco Bell crunchwraps and things, but with better quality ingredients.Like any burrito place, you have to try the different proteins and figure out what you like.  At Chipotle, I love the chicken or the sofritas.  At Moe's it's the steak or the pork.  But they also have some options you can't get at other burrito places like fish and ground beef.Moe's is definitely worthwhile.  It's not more amazing than any other burrito place, but the chips and salsa is a GREAT touch.  It's enough to make it my go-to.",

I was truly upset because I used to love going to the Moe's in BloNo. But I figured it was literally their second day open I will come back in a few weeks and give them a second chance.2nd time around, service was a lot better, and the food quality has improved. If you don't know what Moe's is, it's basically chipotle. As an admit hater of chipotle i actually prefer the Americanized Moe's. Because let's be real chipotle is not real Mexican food it just pretends to be. If you like burritos and don't want to shit yourself for a week come here over chipotle. But don't expect beautiful scenery or super cheap prices. Yeah it's probably going to cost you 10-12 dollars for your meal, do you think you can swing that? I like Moe's maybe with time the employees and the service will get better. My advice is come here at an off time or else you might get stuck waiting for a very long time",

One of the more prominent ones, specifically in relation to the central-Illinois locale, is that there is no good Mexican food here. You may recieve recommendations and you may choose to believe them, but remember this: it's all relative.During my 3 year stay in this small midwestern town, I was duped into trying the fare at a variety of Mexican eateries. Always hoping to replicate my Pilsen, Clark Street or the lady that sells tamales out of a cooler experience I never turned down an invite. On a recent trip back in search of gainful employment (in the form of a university sponsored job fair) I was implored to try Fiesta Cafe. It was the straw that broke the camel's back.Quantity over quality appears to be the motto here, as it is at many C-U establishments. I ordered tamales and was greeted with rubbery and unpleasant masa wrapped around a minimal amount of chicken. The sour cream did indeed come in a school lunch single serving container as mentioned in another review, and the rice and beans were sorely lacking in positive qualities. I gave two stars, however, because the service was good and they carried tamarind Jarritos. Tamarindo! The food was edible, but it just wasn't quite what I'd expected.",

The Flank steak was just strips of greasy meat they probably put in the tacos.  The rice was drenched in grease.  It even smelled bad as the waiter put it in front of me.  I actually gasped.  Let me tell you I LOVE, LOVE mexican food, and I truly got better mexican food off a truck stop (which was amazing, I might add) in Los Angeles.  I mean wow they have great service, a great atmosphere, and I didn't have a margarita (which I love) but the list was extensive.  I bet they are good.   Now, on to the first indication that the food would be bad, the CHIPS! omg out out a bag, just horrible.  The salsas were good.  The contrast of all these good things with very bad ones made me give the place the 2 stars.  I promise you I will not be going back.  Too mad for them because, as I said, I love mexican food!  I could pay a servicer's  tips in a year with the amount of times I've hit Maize and Mas Amigos",

I reallly wanted to like it, it's close to home, has awesome architecture, great outside seating and good atmosphere.  Howerver that's when the good times stopped.  The chips showed up and were so stale they had to have been out of the bag since early last week.  The salsa was not tasty at all and the sour cream came in cafeteria packets or \"in baked potato packets from Golden Corrall\" as Jessie says.When the food showed up it was just as bland as the chips.  Jessie will eat just about any Mexican food on the planet but this was TERRIBLE.  I haven't a clue what other people enjoyed, maybe we managed t order the two things on the menu that are awful.To top it all off there weren't any entertaining people in the whole place to pay attention to.  Just unacceptable.  Needless to say we will not be visiting the Fiesta Cafe again, unless there is a Fiesta with lots of free booze.",

FC was so crowded that ye olde boy friend and I  held out hope for a Mexican experience that would put the culinary and GI horror that was El Toro out of mind.  We're still waiting for the GI results, but at this point I think we're ready to call it:  unless you want to be depressed and wallow in milquetoast mexican food, don't go here.  The ambience was fine.  It was bright and kitschy in ways I find endearing.  Getting the order wrong and forgetting a side?  Forgivable.  Ruining tequila with a syrupy excuse of a marguerita? bad news.  Swapping the meats on my BFs platter? worse news.  Unflavorful and rubbery fish tacos smothered in soggy slaw and served on a plate where everything was white:  death.  A soggy fry job on a cimichanga: death warmed over.  I feel like mexican food is easy to get right:  it is my go-to for home meals when I have nothing on hand.  With beans, cheese, lime juice, salt, something in the pepper family, a tomato and a tortilla -- it is easy to be great.  If you start there and possible add cumin then there is nothing you can do wrong.  I'd be happy to assist FC if they would like to develop this concept.  Until then, I'll just be over here soaking some beans and making my delicious oyster mushroom fajitas.",

I also am not a fan of refried beans, so I love that Fiesta has the option of black beans for all their dishes.

The chicken tasted like it was canned. The chips are good and the salsa isn't too bad either. They're generous with the chips and keep them coming, good thing too since that's what I ate for dinner since my tacos stunk. Good place to go if you're just looking for 'ritas and chips.",

So I decided to check it out: I didn't actually eat there, only got food to go, but the restaurant seems pleasant enough that I will probably go back soon. I ordered the chicken mole, and it turned out to be quite good... in fact, surprisingly good and quite better than most Mexican food I had while I was in NYC. It's also very reasonably priced, and the service was very friendly. Nice place!",

The burritos don't have rice, which is weird and makes them messy, but I actually enjoy the result; more beans and meat is not a bad thing. They give you free chips with two salsas, one spicy and one mild. All the meat I've had there has been top quality and the beef isn't stringy like at so many other places. Also the margarita menu is intense, they have like 20 types of tequila, which I appreciate though it's not really my style.",

She was very nice and patient to all of us, continually making sure we were refilled with horchata (free refills on horchata whaaaat), salsa, or chips. I got the Alex Tacos and asked for no spicy salsa on them, and when I got my food she brought the salsa in a bowl on the side for me to try, and I ended up loving it! The tacos were also loaded up and overflowing and every plate was very hot to the touch, so no one got cold food or left hungry. The cebollitos on the tacos were so amazing!

I also wanted them with scrambled eggs, which seemed odd and self-indulgent, but they did it PERFECTLY.  And I was delighted.  The food was great, and i was pleasantly surprised as I thought it'd suck or be midwesternly bland.Finally, as I left the patio, full and happy, i stopped and looked about.  There are a plethora of flags, American, Mexican, Peace, LGBT Rainbow, a whole plethora of flagtasticness.

Over the yearsI learned to not just look for cheese covered meats with runny beans and \"orange rice\", I wanted basic simple Mexican. I  became a bit of a Mexican restaurant snob.  I moved away, had many many amazing Mexican dishes during my travels. Moved back to CU a couple years ago. Kinda went to Fiesta expecting to not dig it, based on memory that is. Well... i love this spot. It's a long standing tradition of downtown Champaign. I'm a fan of the enchiladas, chicken/mole to be exact. But my real deal it the \"mexican tacos\", three of those and some great guacamole. boom! Done! Good!

Nachos we shared were good, and the small order was more than enough for two of us.My husband had the mixed fajitas, and enjoyed them.  Portion was huge, and we brought about half of it home. I had the pozole and Alex taco.  Both were flavorful.  Pozole had a nice amount of spice.  We'll return.",

The pork tacos were made sweet with some sort of pineapple concoction, and the tortillas were store-bought. I much prefer tortillas that restaurants make themselves.On the plus side, this is one of the Mexican restaurants that tends to offer coupons via the mail. When I dined on a Monday night, Fiesta Cafe had a lot of older couples taking advantage of the discount.",

It doesn't close at 7:30 pm, like every other place in town, so I think it gets a lot of business because it can cater to the crowd that doesn't eat dinner at 5 and then get all tuckered out around 8.I considered writing a long review, but it really boils down to this: this place will stuff you with food, mostly chips and salsa if you're at my table, and they won't stop refilling everything until you tell them you can't eat any more.  Which you will do in a kind of thick, goopy voice because you're actually so full of food your body is storing it in your chest and throat.  I secretly think that the staff likes the spectacle of gluttony, but I don't care. When I go there, it's because I want to get fat and happy and that's what happens.",

A lot of times I've gone here after class for lunch and the line has been pretty long, but I never find myself waiting for longer than 5 minutes because the staff is so quick and efficient. In addition, their queso dip is phenomenal!! They have a few different kinds, although I always just get their three cheese queso as it's delicious and my favorite burrito bowl topping. Their guacamole is pretty good too and the nice plus is that they don't charge a ridiculous $2 fee like Chipotle does for theirs. This place is definitely one of my favorite places to get lunch after or before class.",

However, for whatever it's worth, I do want to share that their beefsteak tacos with cilantro and onion with a hint of lime is absolutely as authentic as it gets from Mexico. I always ordered the tacos with rice and beans. If not ordering take-out and dining-in, I do agree with everyone's love for the never ending chips and salsa. I almost got full for over eating the chips one time. Despite the apparent decline in service from other reviews, I am purely making my high marks for their authentic Mexican tacos and bottomless chips and salsa. I am a creature of habit...when I find something I love and taste, I stick to it and don't order other things on the menu. I only went their to eat my beefsteak tacos. Uno mas!",

(yep.  that ought to do it.  i'm sure he will be supremely less pissed now.)my husband comes in the door 20 minutes later with no food.  he tells me that he was charged for our food again at the restaurant because the woman at the counter (who ironically was reading \"things fall apart\") didn't know that there was any order for pick up.  she re-rung the entire order and charged him for it.  she then received a call from the delivery guy explaining what had happened.  she said she couldn't void the transaction, and that the manager would do it when he came in the next day.  guess what?  he didn't, and it took me two days of calling him to get it done.  guess what?  my food was cold when i got it and it was so not worth paying for it once.  guess what?  i'll never eat at mas amigos again.  their customer service was crap.  their website information was wrong -- the address, the pick up vs. delivery information, even their phone number was incorrect.the employees seemed to not even know what was going on or what the policies were.  the manager was unapologetic and they didn't handle this situation very well at all.  if their food is good, i have no idea, and i probably won't know because i won't order from them again.",

We  used to frequent Cocina Real, in the same location, and since the staff and management are the same we assumed the quality would be as well. Right off the bat we realized how sub-par the food actually was- the tortilla chips were completely disgusting. They were so oily (the wax paper lining the chip basket was completely soaked) and a horribly flaky texture. We wondered if the chef has fried the tortillas at the wrong temperature or for too long. When we received our food, we were horrified at the greasiness of our food. It went beyond the typical unhealthiness of mexican food- the food was literally inedible from the amount of oil it was covered in. The size of our orders was so small for the price we paid for them. We were terrified to order dessert for fear that our flan would come drenched in oil as well. When we received the check, the prices we were charged did not match those on the menu (we were charged additional). We will not be returning to this restaurant.",

Unfortunately today they did not care about providing even the most fundamental elements of customer service. Our server clearly did not want to be there which was evident by his blatant lack of attentiveness.  After he finally brought us menus, we quickly decided on what to order. Unfortunately, in the amount of time it took our server to return to the table, we could have read the menus front-to-back, two times over. We figured hey maybe the kitchen is very busy at this hour. Then I realized that our server was sitting in a booth rolling silverware. Not just him, three others as well! I've been a server before. I get it. You have to roll silverware, but to do that in lieu of tending to (well-tipping) patrons is a sign of carelessness. What was most annoying was that I made eye contact with them and was ignored. Eventually, I was able to wave down our server and we ordered. I guess he grew tired of us and recruited a coworker to take over. The new server was better. Although he did take my drink and disappear without refilling it for a while. At least he cracked a smile and showed some sign of life. The worst part of this experience was watching everyone else get service...except us. I'm not likely to return to a restaurant when I'm left feeling unwelcome.",

When the shrimp cocktail arrived I noticed the sauce had a sour/bitter taste that it's not supposed to have... It seemed almost fermented like it was expired. The shrimp had a funny skin on it that I've never seen on shrimp before. May have been the result of freezer burn but it also tasted funny. Against my better judgment I ate my shrimp cocktail ... but my worst fears were confirmed later in the evening when I developed food poisoning! Avoid!!",

This is by far a significant drop from Maize which is just around the corner. Based on the reviews I was excited to try this as an alternative because there was actually seats and I could eat the food fresh from the kitchen. When you walk in you will notice that this place is sort of a hole in the wall place. I had to even ask if they accepted credit cards, yes they do! Everything in the restaurant was sticky from the menu to table to the floor. Usually that may mean good traditional food. Unfortunately this was not the case. I ordered a carne asada and enjoyed my mexican coke eating complimentary chips with salsa. The chips are straight from a bag and the salsa was quite bland. I was hungry so I enjoyed my chips still and ate the whole basket. When my carne asada came it was not what I expected. The meat was hidden in a pile of chopped up onion, peppers, and large chunks of green onion stems. Why would you put giant pieces of green onion in with the carne asada. These were not pleasant and bitter tasting. The carne asada is usually very tender the way it was prepared. This was again not the case. Very thinly sliced meat that was very chewy. The problem is that it was thinly sliced so it was quite over cooked. The refried beans was a soupy mess, but the mexican rice was passable. All and all this does not come even close to maize in the term of quality and flavor. Did I mention that there was so much oil in the dish... Finally when I paid I did not get an itemized receipt but as I saw him adding the price of the entree I believe I was overcharged as the menu list 8.99 for the carne asada, but I was charged 9.50. Seriously...Pro: None....Cons: The restaurant is not clean, the quality of the meat is poor, bland salsa, very greasy carne asadaHidden gem:1 dollar tacos on Wednesday",

Treat him right and he'll take really good care of you.The guac was the best I've ever had.  Even better than my own.  His ingredients are much fresher than what I can get...no fair.  Tons of yummy cilantro.Best place on campus hands down.I miss this place so much; one of the few things about school I miss.",

As much as I like it, Chipotle doesn't count. I have eaten lots of somewhat authentic Mexican food in my life time, but I honestly never expected to find a place like this!It's a pretty easy place to miss. It's a tiny brick building that says \"Mexican Grocery Store\", and the interior is certainly isn't going to win any awards for cleanliness. But I wasn't fooled, I could tell right away that this place was going to serve me true authentic mexican cuisine.The menu above the counter might be hard to read, but they had a very nice selection of meats to choose from for their tacos. I tried Carnitas, Shredded Beef, and Chorizo tacos. All of them were quite delicious!But the food wasn't the only impressive part about this establishment. When my friends and I went, it was manned by just one person, and he was extremely friendly to boot. He really deserves a medal for the effort.",

Salsa and chips are really good.. on the spicy side. 4/5 3. $1 taco Wednesdays 4. Sauces that come with the tacos. 5. Reminds me of King Taco in Los Angeles. Cons: 1. The ground beef tasted a bit off last time I was here. 2. Chicken was dry and adding salsa did not help. 3. Service can be slow. First time my friend and I went, we were the only ones there and was still slow. Takes some time getting things such as water, straw, fork, etc. Or maybe I'm just a needy customer.  4. Ambiance/music - an ant was crawling on me while eating. Mexican music can get loud.",

Then I ordered steak, chorizo and chicken tacos and what I found was fresh ingredients and some really authentic, tasty Mexican food.  The meat is always cooked to order, and the lettuce is always green, tomatoes fresh and corn tortillas are delicious.  All the tacos come with a slice of lime and adds a lot to the flavor.  Sometimes if its not busy, they'll add in some fried green onions.The guy that is always working there taking orders is always friendly and recognizes me from coming in before and even offered some free nachos and homemade salsa my second time coming in since I had been there the day before.I've only tried the assorted tacos there, but their 1 dollar taco deal every Wednesday makes it worth checking it out.  Plus, if you are a HUGE fan of Valentina hot sauce as I am (check it out!) a similar bottle from one at Schnucks selling at about 3-4 dollars, sells here for 99 cents.  There's some generic grocery items on the shelves, and a huge fridge that has Coke bottled in Mexico (has real sugar and tastes better), assorted Jarritos and other drinks.My only gripe about the place was the overall dirty feel of where people eat.  I gave it a 3/5 because the tables are dirty, garbage was almost full and haven't been cleaned.  They're pretty understaffed, so there is a wait time for wanting to pay, and probably why the tables look like they're never cleaned.  However, the cooking area and food storage is easily visible when you come in, and you can tell that, thankfully, it is sanitary and clean.",

There were flies all over the place. The produce looked so sad and wilted. The canned goods should be the same as anywhere else, but it doesn't seem like it's much better stocked than the Meijer or World Harvest for what I typically buy. I'd prefer to go to Chicago for canned goods, tortillas, masa, etc. (Tortillas and masa keep very well in the freezer) or if in a pinch, buy some from a restaurant that gets its goods from Chicago.Bottom line- the food isn't anything remarkable and the lack of cleanliness is disconcerting.",

Not only was the chorizo perfectly cooked with the eggs, but it came with delicious beans, rice and a very generous helping of tortillas to eat it with.  I also bought some candy and a strawberry Boing! drink and the total was only $7.50.  Very reasonably priced and worth every bite!  Breakfast this great tasting would cost a lot more anywhere else.  Everything tasted delicious, and I am excited to try their pozole (a hominy soup) and tamales, which the (really nice) guy working said was all homemade in the shop.BOYCOTT CHIPOTLE AND QDOBA!  Go to El Charro and eat real Mexican food.",

I thought that was how tamales were, factory made tubes of really yellow corn meal with consistently round tubes of ground beef in the middle. The tamales at El Charro are the definitely handmade variety, and could not be more authentic or better. Shredded chicken or shredded beef perfectly seasoned.Go in and order a dozen for pickup in a couple of days, or maybe some will be available right then. Steam them up for a couple of hours and you will be very happy.",

The employees are definitely juggling a lot of tasks at once, which makes them not be able to provide the best customer service. This business had grown a lot in the past three years but because of that, they resort to skimping out on food in tacos. The food is really good and based off of the taste of food I would recommend coming here but don't expect the three tables to be clean. I would also recommend coming here during the weekends because their specialty food is good. If you want a authentic food this is definitely the place to try.",

It's located only down the street from my place so it was a quick walk there and back.I ordered a steak burrito and it was ready in a little less than 10 minutes, the guy at the counter was nice.The burrito was kind of sloppily rolled and seemed to be pretty loose and not quite filled up all the way. This made it a little difficult to eat because the insides kept falling out. The steak was like finely chopped up and at times resembled ground beef. The burrito had like a pico de gallo and lettuce and cheese but not much else, I found myself constantly putting the included green salsa on. It was also quite greasy.The French fries actually didn't look like I expected, these were dark and actually looked pretty good. Unfortunately though, they were dripping with grease, tasted a little old, and were very soggy. Overall everything was pretty greasy and kind of your stereotypical low-cost Mexican fare, similar to Burrito King down the street. I don't think half as good as Chipotle or even Maize, which halfway through my food, I kind of wished I would have gotten instead, even though they're more expensive.",

Steak Chipotle Burrito was big; but, like most places they are made in such a way that you just get large pockets of one thing in each bite.  Panchero's at least mixes theirs a bit.  The steak was gray with a  non-discript flavor; but at least was chopped small enough that it didn't seem chewy.  My spicy salsa was not apparent in the meal.  The jalapeos were all lumped together in one of those aforementioned pockets.Chips were okay, tad greasy but good salt level. Guac tasted like it was the prepackaged stuff you can buy in plastic bags in the produce section of the grocery store - it had that weird citric acid aftertaste that you don't get with fresh made guac.  Did I still eat it?  Yes, I was hungry and I paid for it!  Was I disappointed? Yes, I had heard good things about the place... Live and Yelp, I mean learn!",

Luckily, I can count on Cactus Grill when I want a fast lunch that is less corporate than a McBurger.The quality of the food is near mediocre; some ingredients really shine, but others somehow always disappoint.  Many of the meats (chicken, steak) are chewy and dry, though they're left to soak in their juices before service (doesn't help, unfortunately).  For my meat option, I usually stick with the fish, which is deep-fried in a panko-like batter.  The fish dishes also usually come with a drizzle of creamy chipotle sauce, yum.Recently I bought a burrito with cilantro-lime rice and black beans.  The rice is an unmistakable (but poor) imitation of the rice from Chipotle, with cilantro that is never mixed in evenly.  When I bit into the beans, I realized they were still...undercooked?  I was pretty surprised by this discovery as most places use pre-made, canned beans rather than beans cooked in-store...so compliments to homemade beans, but disappointment at undercooked beans.Despite my criticisms, I still return to Cactus Grill every other week to pick up food.  It's not luxury, but I don't expect too much from lunch on a weekday.",

A couple notes-The special is not just lunch but all day.Also the burrito wrap can be substituted for a bowl which they fill with your choice of  types of beans, rices, salsa and guac ( I presume they would put guac on it if you asked) tomatoes and onions sour cream.I recommend going in to pick your favs before trying delivery, that being said I was there at 7:30 pm and they have two drivers so there is an attempt to make the delivery service better.This is point where I have to say the steak bowl was very good! I chose Spanish rice, black beans and the standard veggies with cheese and sour cream, the portion was plenty and the ratios of components was well done, I recommend going in for your first time to see the options first hand, for me giving it a second chance was worth while.",

Other places have peppers, saut onions, etc. and salsa and jalapeos are included in the price elsewhere. If you don't order ahead for pick up, be prepared for sub-par service. Also, make sure you tip or they become incredibly nasty!! I'll stick with chipotle, qdoba, and pancheros.",

I just moved here from south Texas, was really craving Mexican food, and felt too lazy to go sit in a restaurant, so delivery it was. I ordered a cheese quesadilla (with onion and tomato for a sad attempt at pico de gallo), and chips and salsa.The quesadilla was incredibly greasy, the tomato chunks were quite large, and the onion was far too overpowering for my taste. The chips and salsa were another matter. The chips were edible, but they weren't my favorite. And warning with the salsa, if you order the spicy salsa, expect green salsa. I'm used to red, so the possibility of green didn't even cross my mind. I'm not a fan of green salsa, so my dislike is likely an artifact of my dislike of green salsa in general, not this specific salsa.Plus side? The food was delivered about half an hour earlier than estimated.Looking at the rest of the reviews, it doesn't appear that Cactus Grill is ALWAYS bad, so maybe mine was just a bad experience, but still...TL;DR: greasy quesadilla, hard chips, green salsa, searching for another Mexican restaurant",

Chips and guac is a must you get a monster guac thing so you don't run out I hate when I run out of guac. There fish burrito is good too load up on the special fishy sauce I like it. The tacos are good too. Man everything is good and you should just check this spot out. I don't really mess with the delivery cause it takes like 30 minutes and you can be in and out in 5. You can win a free burrito at the gumball machine but I'm currently 0 for like 100 so not likely.

The guy on the other end says he'd get in touch with the delivery driver and see what was going on; this after telling me it should be 33 minutes because his driver was on my side of town.  I hung up expecting that he'd call and give me a new more accurate time to expect my food but 1:10 comes without a call and at this point I'm ready to cancel my order unless they're willing to take off some of the price for the long wait.  As I'm on the phone with him the second time my food finally came.   I shouldn't have tipped the driver but I did after he said that he'd gotten lost.  On to the food itself.  The flavor was good when I tasted it.  Very unevenly distributed throughout my lukewarm meal in what  should have been a satisfyingly large burrito.  The rice was very bland in many parts and the sauce was a far cry from what I consider spicy.  To be fair I grew up in Texas so they may have been catering to Midwestern spicy which isn't nearly spicy enough for a south/southwest pallet.  For the $12 I paid after the tip, I should have gotten much better for my money.  Oh and how they justify a $2 charge for delivery (which I found out after the driver was long gone) is beyond me.  It's too bad because I really wanted to like this place.  Maybe I'll have a better experience dining in but I might not have the stomach or wallet to give them a second chance.  A free or largely discounted meal would go a long way in chalking this up to a fluke.",

Wednesday's special is  Steak Burrito for $4.99, so I went with that, even though everyone who DOES like this place says that the Honey Grilled Chicken is the way to go.   Since I was getting the special, I decided to get a side of chips and salsa, thinking that just in case the burrito was terrible, at least I could snack on the chips.To their credit, the burrito was much better fare than my previous experience with the tacos.  I got the cilantro rice and black beans, but the steak just does not have that much flavor.   I got the spicy green salsa, and this salsa does carry some heat with it when you have quite a bit of it at once.  It had very little shredded cheese on it, which could have at least been a saving grace if there had been more -- they should think about going with a cheese sauce (ala Qdoba's Steak Queso burrito).  Overall, it was food and probably a decent deal for the $5 special, but I wasn't impressed on taste.So...the chips.   These were not even close to the life preserver for which I was hoping.  The chips were cold, HARD, and downright inedible.  They were only barely salted, and honestly, I was afraid I might chip a tooth.  I ate about 4, and that's all I could bear.  I got the hot salsa with those as well, and even tried soaking them a bit, but I ended up throwing most of them away.I'm sorry to those who do enjoy Cactus Grill and can't understand why I'm down on them.  Like I said before, I would like to see them succeed.  There is a severe lack of variety for lunch on south Neil near my work, and this would be a nice location if the food was more up to par.  I will give it one more shot with the chicken, just because i like burritos but refuse to fight the campus parking/traffic.  If it improves significantly, I will post an update.",

                "review": "Ordered delivery on a Saturday night and wanted to try something different.I ordered a chicken burrito bowl with guacamole and a fish taco. The bowl was on special for $5.25.I ordered through grubhub and delivery was kind of slow, a little over 1 hour and 10 minutes, which I guess is to be expected on a busy Saturday night. The ordering itself though was very easy and convenient on grub hub.The fish taco was surprisingly good. The fish tasted fresh, and it was a fairly large size with all the toppings. I really liked the fish and the sauce it came with. My burrito bowl was also quite tasty. The honey grilled chicken was flavorful and appeared to be of good quality. There was no shortage of toppings, especially the guacamole I paid a ~$1.30 extra for, this was fresh and delicious. The portion was large enough to save half for later, too!Overall for ~$15 delivered this was a pretty good deal. I'm not quite sure if it was better than Chipotle, but it was definitely cheaper for a comparable product. I would get Cactus Grill again for sure.",

I asked if they were open, which compelled him to just turn his head and yell to the other guy in the back to come take his place.When the other guy came up to the window I asked him why nobody answered the order speaker when I tried to order.  High as a kite, he looked me straight in the eye and said, \"Ohh, dats cuz I shut off my headset fo awhile.\"He gave me a large water when I asked for one, which was great, but he didn't put the lid on all the way and I immediately spilled 10 ounces onto my crotch right before the big presentation.This place needs to by mystery shopped.Where's the oversight?  Whoever owns this joint is paying good money for the help to shut all the lights, untuck their shirts and smoke weed out back all night.

After not receiving part of my order, I called to inform that I wanted to come back later to get it. I also informed that when I was there it seemed very frenetic and hurried which was very unusual. It was then that I was told they lost their store manager, several associates and other various workers because of some 'controversy issue'. Sounds like they have some pretty serious issues, the first being competent help!The manager I spoke to flat out said it would be several weeks before they got back up and running they way they should as they are trying to get people trained. Question - Why stay open? Why not close your doors for a week and get your shit together? Won't you do more damage to the business by serving only half our orders or making them incorrectly or even making us wait for an unreasonable amount of time to even give you our order in the first place?Perhaps this summer they can work their way back to the friendly, fast service they used to have; although I'm not holding my breath. In the meantime, I suggest going to the store and getting items for homemade tacos.",

Kudos to T bell for hiring this lady. She was quick clear and even friendly. So often are we forced to deal with surely food service employees and this lady made my midnight taco run just a great experience. It's a Taco Bell man, I'm not really going to review the food.",

Two of our 4 meals had MINOR adjustments (add cheese, no onion) that weren't made. When I ask them to fix it, the response is, \"you're gonna have to wait a few minutes.\" When my meal comes back, it doesn't have onion, or two other ingredients that were supposed to be on it. Chip basket went empty the whole meal. Never did get the bill--finally just went to the register, where I also had to ask for the carryout boxes. Service matters to us, and they're going to have to do better on an almost $50 meal if they want us to keep coming back.",

The sweetness of pineapple in this fried concoction added a really nice touch. Some places place too much meat on the food, others have too many toppings, or use too much oil. The huarache was a bit on the greasy side, but overall it was balanced. The sauces they provided, too, tasted homemade, and I didn't remember how unique they were until I saw some of the other reviews here. I was quite pleased with the meal, and would definitely stop by again.",

The staff there is delightful and attentive when it's not busy. The food is good. I would go even if it were for the complimentary chips & salsas alone! The selection of salsas is like a choose-your-own-adventure. But onto the entrees... I like all of the huaraches I've tried. Lengua tacos and lengua ranchera are my favorites. Carnitas and barbacoa are excellent choices too. The desserts are not bad either. And they have horchata! Reasonable prices, large portions, and great food make this place a winner.",

Great drink selection, and their margaritas aren't too sweet or too sour - just right.  Their fish taco's are freakin' amazing. The only thing I have against this place is that all their salsas are spicy (and I'm a weakling when it comes to spice). But! They are redeemed by their queso dip - top of it's class. You'll see me here all the time - moreso once they put out their patio seating!",

They had my favorite fried fish in town..But I decided to make the best of it and try the new place.  I've now been twice, very pleased each time.  My girlfriend and I have tried the carnitas huarache, a torta alpastor special, the tongue tacos, and the carnitas burrito.  They've all been great.  Fresh vegetables and flavorful, tender meat.The huarache came with a grilled pineapple to put on it.  I was a little skeptical but it was delicious.  Everything comes with cilantro and onion, and most come with lettuce and tomato.  Our take-out meals came with a bag of fresh fried chips and three little plastic containers of sauce - one salsa verde, one fruity salsa, and one more spicy orange salsa.  They were all excellent.  (The second time we went, the chips were a little more greasy, but they had definitely been recently fried.)They're fast on take-out, and if they stay this good, it may be hard to eat in at one of the tables.My only complaint is that they do not have horchata at the moment.My two favorite places for Mexican in town now are Mas Amigos and this place - and both are excellent.  The prices on most entrees is around $6-7 - which is actually comparable to what it costs to get enough fast food to fill us up.  Between Chipotle, Taco Bell, or here, the choice is clear.",

I was the only one there.... They had a few specials on the board and I saw fish tacos (3) for $5.99.  I ordered those and a mexican coke.  I sat down at one of the nice booths (restaurant easily seats 30+) and the nice waitress brought out a generous portion of chips and four salsas.  There was a mild, spicy, green and another medium/mild.  The chips were warm and crunchy.  Almost finished the basket!  The fish tacos came out soon after and they were great!  The fish was lightly breaded and fried.... I wish they were grilled, but I didn't ask.... There was a generous mound of onions, cilantro, cabbage and a mayonaise based drizzle on top!  They were great!  I also got a mexican coke.... It came out warm, but drinking warm coke reminds me of my grandparents...they used to serve us warm coke so it was nostalgic for me.... I bet it would bother a lot of other people.... But anyways, the bill came out to about $8.60.   Not bad!   I would say that this place would give Maize a run for its money.... They have a lot more seating and the food is just as good if not better.  Too bad it's waaay out in Urbana...They're also open for breakfast....  I will definitely be back to try some other things!!  I hope they don't fall suit to the prior restaurants at this location....that would be a terrible loss.",

The place is very small 5 or 6 tables. Our feeling about this place is if your doing dinner get it to go if for no other reason then the terrible lack of a margarita, they do not have a liquor license may not want the liabilities that come with that, but for a quick lunch sit and have a taco or two. One thing that needs a lot of help is the menu, english would be a good place to start and there are no appetizers or sides on the menu we had to ask if they had guacamole. They do and its very good, you think you might want that on the menu? So as four stars says yay I'm a fan, it just needs a little work the food is great the price is right and they are fast. So the feel of the place is fast food joint think Taco Bell with great food.",

Probably because it came from a warm blender, but the warm plastic glass they served it in didn't help. I ordered a nopales huarache and I'm pretty sure the nopales were canned because they were incredibly salty. Other than being too salty, the huarache was delicious!

Dips and tortilla chips were just lovely. I love how they come in such huge \"bottles\" and you can pour yourselves as much as you need. Food was delicious. I had a burrito with mole sauce. Honestly, the mole sauce was not enough. I'd love to have more of it flooding my burrito and not just trickles of it. It could be a little sweeter but I believe that's just my preference. As price and portion go, I would say they are average. Not too expensive, just the right amount with an average price ($$). But quality and taste were on point for Champaign.",

This is definitely one of the top mexican restaurants in the Champaign-Urbana area, along with Maize.

I can confirm this because I've eaten here multiple times. There is only one waiter who serves for an entire restaurant that's always packed, so be prepared to wait just as long as you did to get a seat to wait for your receipt. Dinner lengths here are double what they would be anywhere else simply because of this understaffing issue.",

I got three different kinds, all of which tasted like burnt, old meat, topped with slimy cilantro and onion-- no tomato, lettuce, cheese, or sour cream-- which was confusing to me, since my friend had ordered hard tacos and had gotten the listed toppings. Her hard shells tasted stale! I filled up on tons of guacamole and chips and salsa, but I feel like their food quality has gone down since opening.",

I usually feel like I can accurately judge how good a Mexican restaurant is based on the quality of the sauces. SO I appreciate that this place has some freshly made salsas. The chipotle one is not good, however, the other 3 sauces are fine.This place is small though so in the evenings you may have to wait a bit for a table.

Served with 4 salsas and chips.  Spanish speaking customers seem to get a fifth salsa that is orange, just like a habanero.  The Mexican guy across the aisle from me definitely broke a sweat during lunch - don't know if it was the orange mystery salsa, but guessing it was.  I'll be back but note the booths are a tight fit and there's only 20 - 30 seats, so carry out might be a consideration.",

The dining area is smaller than my living room which means there is no excuse for not keeping it clean.  The ceiling fans were caked with dust and grit as were many of the surfaces.  The floor was filthy.  Come on, guys, that place could be cleaned daily in less than 15 minutes. If the public area is that way, one can imagine what is in the kitchen.  I took my food home, opened the box, was craving Mexican food, but could not get myself to eat any of it, thinking of the general filth of the dining area and its implications for the kitchen.  I like seeing little places like this succeed, so I hope that someone decides to start cleaning this place on a regular basis.  No one likes clumps of dust dropping into their food from a neglected ceiling fan or wondering what the hygiene is in the kitchen.",

Since we've moved I haven't had occasion to drive by very frequently, but I was pleased to see a new place here that finally looked like it might have a chance to stay. I've been eyeing it for a while, and finally happened to be by today at lunch and stopped in. I am so glad I did, and I'll be finding a reason to head over that direction again soon.The carnitas huarache was fantastic. Really flavorful carnitas:  juicy and tender with a great char outside. The huarache itself was tasty, and the cheese was great too - not that plastic stuff you get most places. It came with a little bag of perfectly fried, thin and crispy chips and 3 salsas that ranged from fruity to spicy. I wasn't a huge fan of any of the salsas in all honesty, but the huarache more than made up for it.There are 3 tables that seat 4 and a couple of tables for 2, plus some counter seating. I don't think that building has ever been so sparkling and clean, even way back when it was Sweet Betsy's years ago. They obviously did a lot of work in there. The service was quick and friendly too.",

I have been here several times now and each time am very happy with the quality and service. The salsas are all great, each their own unique flavor. The chips are always fresh and crispy. Most recently I got the traditional steak tacos. The steak was flavorful and tender, and I love whatever corn tortillas they use (maybe they make in house?). There are so many items to choose from and a pretty good vegetarian selection as well. You can't beat it for cheap eats. I love that it has more of an authentic vibe than the other Tex Mex joints in town.",

I was not really expecting anything too great when I walked in because of the small size of the restaurant. I was seated quickly and given tortilla chips with a variety of sauces. The chips were way better than the cheap packaged stuff you find at grocery stores. I liked the dark red spicy sauce. I ordered the Fajita Loca with ham, steak and bacon. I was pleasantly surprised by the ample portion and fresh meats and rice offered. The steak was flavorful and not too chewy unlike cheap \"mock meats\". Although I don't really like bell peppers, they were pretty good, and I finished all of them on my dish. The service is great with friendly and prompt staff, My order was taken quickly and I did not have to wait a long time to be served. One minor thing is that you don't get a spoon with your standard fork and knife. I did not really mind this, but you can probably ask to get a spoon if you really wanted one. Although some people say the place is too hot, I did not find it a problem when I went on July 3rd 2015(76 degrees F) Would definitely go again- 5 stars for the great food and reasonable prices.Here is a pdf of their menu because I could not find it anywhere online: bit.ly/Huaraches-Moroleon-Menu (Hit the x button when Dropbox tells you to sign up)",

The highlight of Huaraches Moreleon (and what keeps us coming back more than anything else) is definitely their homemade chips and the three sauces they bring out with them. Molto bene! I mean, muy bueno! Whatever. They're pretty good.The best entree they make is the Aver Si Puede (\"See if You Can\"), which is basically a gigantic plate of meat with some rice and beans thrown in the middle in case you were in need of inferior sources of protein to feel like you're eating Mexican food. It feeds two large people or a small family of small people. Their basic enchilada sauce is not much more than watered-down tomato sauce. The mole sauce is ok. The chipotle sauce on the Enchiladas Suizas is probably the best I've had thus far. Still, even the worst enchiladas are pretty decent.I like the breakfast skillets. Don't order soup.I have not had good experiences with their more \"exotic\" offerings such as tripas or lengua tacos. Either the chef does not know how to make them, or the ingredients are poor. Superior tripas tacos can be found on literally any taco truck operating in the area between Santa Monica and Houston, TX. Go to Huaraches, but avoid these menu items.Oh, the prices are reasonable, and the service is typically fast unless you order the more \"exotic\" offerings I mentioned.The food is great for the area, but it still doesn't hold a candle to most Mexican food in the Southwest. For that I have to give it four out of five stars. But you should still go. This is a small, fledgling place, and it deserves your custom.",

I typically frequent Maize for Mexican food just because it's within a few minutes from my work, but I've been looking to try different places occasionally.I got 3 different tacos to go (steak, chorizo, chicken).  The tacos were good, but the chorizo was not very flavorful.   Having read other reviews, people say that the chips and salsa are the big draw.  I wasn't offered any with my order to go, so I can't say anything about that.It's a small place, but has a fair number of seats in it for the space.  That's one big advantage over the obvious comparison to Maize, which has minimal seating.Overall, the food was not spectacular enough to warrant another 15-20 minutes of extra driving for lunch, but I'd be willing to go back for a sit-down meal to try out the chips and salsa with their other entree selections.   Recommend that you start offering chips/salsa to people (like me) who make to-go orders!",

I've been to lots of Mexican restaurants and have never seen that. It has some delicious unique options like CACTUS fajitas and a nice fresh salad with pineapple chunks, cactus, veggies, pico de gallo, and beans-I always skip the cheese and sour cream to make stuff VEGAN and let me tell you, with all of the fresh flavors, I don't miss the dairy at all!-The sauces! Oh my, they bring out 3 bottles of house-made sauces to the table with the chips, and those sauces.....the green is my favorite and the smoky red comes in a close second!!!-The guacamole is fresh and just as yummy as guac can be-Also it's always an awesome value-Did I mention they have a full breakfast menu too??!-I could go on and on but I will stop now.

It was a must-try for the carry out I typically get once a week down here at school.No website or menu so I made the drive over to the south-ish side of Urbana and walked inside the restaurant, which is very small, yet authentic and charming. I asked for a menu to order take out and let the indecisiveness get the better of me. The menu is fairly extensive, lots of your typical burrito and fajita entrees, but also many other not-so-common items like fish tacos, lengua (beef tongue) and chicarron (fried pork rinds/belly) among other things you won't find on campus at Maize or Burrito King. I ended up getting the steak ranchero with a pastor taco and a chicarron taco. After about 10 minutes my order was handed to me and I anxiously drove home waiting to see if the hype was real. I ate the tacos first, which are small to standard sized, on corn tortillas and were pretty tasty. The chicarron was something new to me, it had an interesting fried flavor and had a very spicy sauce on it, but tasty nonetheless. I've had pastor before and this pastor was definitely on point, the meat was tender and had lots of flavor. The tacos were awesome! I only ate half of the steak ranchero and saved the rest for a hungover Saturday lunch. This also was quite good. It was served fajita style with 3 flour tortillas, the steak itself in ranchero sauce and came with some tasty grilled onions and peppers, along with pinto beans, rice, and a dollop of lettuce/guac/pico mix. The meat itself was of better than average quality, the beans were tasty, rice unique due to the veggies mixed in, and the guac seemed alright but I really didn't get too much on my trey and it kind of mixed with the beans. Overall it was a decent sized portion for ~$9.99. My only qualms would be that everything kind of blended together in the trey, it would have been better if the trey/take out thing had dividers in it to separate the rice from the beans from the meat from the everything else. I must also mention that like most Mexican places, Huaraches throws in a small bag of tortilla chips and 2 salsas with take out orders. The chips were pretty good, the red/orange salsa was incredibly spicy but had a very interesting taste, I have not had anything quite like it before. The other green salsa wasn't bad either.Overall a solid take out experience. I will definitely have to come back and eat inside the restaurant.",

I spent the majority of my 20's in Southern Cali so I've definitely done my research when it comes to tacos. The tortillas are made fresh in the kitchen, the meat is well seasoned and the toppings are perfect! I love the Lomo Mexica (not on the menu) which is basically the grilled cheese rib-eye taco. Yasss honey! The steak, fish, pork and chicken are great too (in that order) I have also tried their sopes which are totally yummy, but the tacos are definitely the main event! Stop by when you have time and patience to deal with the lines and limited seating. If I had to state one downside it would be the chips which are nothing to rave about but hey this place is A1!",

They have paper menus as you walk in.I ordered the Steak Burrito while my Fiance ordered the Chicken burrito, we got a bottle of water and a bottle of Coke, before we were fully seated the waitress had chips and salsa waiting for us. a few seconds later the burritos showed up, SUPER FAST! the chips were very good. the Salsa's were good too! The Burrito's were just the right size, and tasted great, they also serve the bottle of Cokes with real Sugar which is awesome. the workers are nice and everything was clean, i'd love to come back if i find myself in this part of Illinois.",

This very small, hole-in-the-wall restaurant is truly a hidden gem! The tastefully decorated building is very small and has limited seating, which honestly suits the quiet intimate atmosphere perfectly! (if parking or seating is a problem, you may want to show up during \"off hours\", such as after 1pm or before noon, perhaps? We visited during break when campus was empty and had no issues). The owner was very friendly, chatting with customers and explaining the different items to us and offering his recommendations.The portions are very inexpensive ($2-4 on average!) and on the small size, so that you may mix-and-match different items. My fiance and I each ordered 2 chicken tacos and then shared 2 quesadillas: one filled with pumpkin blossom and one with huitlacoche. We had never had either filling, and they were AMAZING! The corn tortillas are all homemade, a little thicker than usual and really good. We were also offered free tortilla chips (which were also thicker than normal, perhaps made in-house? Very good!) with two delicious homemade salsas and lime. A delicious and filling meal for two for just over $10, not bad at all!In short, this place offered some of the best Mexican food I've ever tried/ It is extremely authentic, and much lighter than the more stereotypical heavy refried beans/sour cream/cheddar cheese/oil-drenched Americanized \"Mexican\" fare. We will be returning next week to bring a large order home to my fiance's family in town :)",

Only fine. I felt three quarters of it was lettuce. It was good sized and I took the rest of it home. I smothered it with cheese and extra salsa and sour cream after reheating and it was much better the second time around. I probably won't be returning any time soon.",

I've had Maize bookmarked for quite some time, but I never managed to make my way that far down Green Street to check it out. My brother graduated from UIUC last weekend and I knew it was my last chance to try it! It was about a half mile walk to Maize from Alma Mater. We took one look at those long graduation day lines and decided we would much rather enjoy some Mexican food. There was a crowd of people waiting outside when we arrived and at first I thought that was because all of these people were waiting in line to order. Once I stepped inside, I saw it was because the place was so tiny and there wasn't any room for people to stand around waiting. The actual line to wait for ordering was quite short. Luckily, it seems like a lot of people choose to order carry-out and with good reason. The whole place probably doesn't seat more than 12 and the seating is just countertop. We originally also chose carry-out, but then we were lucky enough to snag some seats, so we decided to dine in. I ordered the biggest guacamole, which was $7. I also ordered a Vulcane, which was less than $3. Say what? I know the general idea is to eat 2-3 of these little tortillas for a full meal, but I was planning on loading up on chips and guac. The guac = OMG. There was so much! I shared with our group of three and there was still enough leftover to enjoy later in the day. The Vulcane was my favorite, though. It has amazing cheese melted with a toasty crunch to it so you can't fold it up to eat. There was also Spanish rice, onion, shredded lettuce, and avocado. I totally inhaled it. I was tempted to give Maize four stars because of the cramped space, but I just can't do that. Maize is more about the amazing food than having a relaxing sit-down meal. I strongly recommend you try Maize if you're in the area!",

I'll admit the first time I went I was skeptical. It's way too small, and the chips and salsa leave something to be desired (but, seriously, who cares?). Once the food came I was absolutely convinced by the hype. The al pastor buritto was incredible. The flavors were authentic, the meat was moist and delicious, and everything about that burrito told me that this place was a winner. Every time I have been back since the food has been just as good. Tortas, tacos, burritos, flautas, sopes, you name it; this place has it all and it's all fantastic. I have yet to try something that didn't leave me full, satisfied, and waiting to be hungry again so I could come back.This place is sensational. The prices are low and the food is first rate. Just, do yourself a favor and order to go. The place simply isn't big enough to house all the hungry maize addicts trying to get their fix.",

I got some sticker shock (after being told how cheap it was), paying almost $10 for a fish taco and a very small tostada, both of which were good for Champaign, but a bit bland. I'm hoping other menu items will be more fulfilling, and at the very least filling.I'd also assumed that, since they apparently offer free chips and salsa at the restaurant, I would get some with my takeaway order. I was disappointed to find out, upon arriving home with my order, that is not the case, so it felt like an even worse deal than I originally thought. I will definitely give it a second shot now that I know what to expect, but I wish they had their prices listed on the website and that they made it clear you only get chips and salsa with dine-in service. Service was friendly and fast. Parking is horrendous (only a few parking spots, and very limited street parking nearby), but that is no fault of the restaurant; just be aware you might have to circle the block a few times before a spot opens up.",

The veggie huaraches has cheese, avocado, beans, lettuce, sour cream and yet was still somehow not very flavorful. A squeeze of lime wedge did help some. Same with the fish taco, bland and heavily reliant on the lime wedge. The horchata was less flavorful than I've had before as well. My dining partner had a pastor burrito with just beans and cheese and he said the same: good, fresh, kinda bland. Overall nothing was \"bad\", but nothing was crave inducing. And considering the price leaned to the \"tad over-priced for what you're getting\" side I'm not sure it'll be on the list of go-to Champaign restaurants. But because everything was so fresh we'll definitely give it another chance before we totally rule it out.",

I ordered for take-out, knowing that it would probably be packed and when I got there it was indeed filled with people. I ordered a handful of items for me and my roommate.  I got a rib-eye taco, a chorizotaco, and a pastor taco.  The rib-eye was thinly sliced and was of good quality.  The grilling gave it a little bit of char and was tasty.  I did feel that it was a bit underseasoned and could have used a touch more salt.  The chorizo taco had your standard ground chorizo, but was delicious.  The pastor taco was the best of the three, great flavor and a touch of heat.  As others have mentioned the tortillas are handmade and they're fantastic.  A bit chewier than your typical store bought tortilla and adds an element of texture to their dishes.  My roommate got a fish taco, a carne asada taco, and a grilled chicken quesadilla.  He seemed to enjoy everything as well, but don't have much commentary beyond that.   Definitely a place worth visiting regularly, seeing that their prices are low and the food is great.",

I heard rave reviews about here, and have tried them a couple of times, but they are just good in my opinion. So, this is a local 4 (I'd rather have Huaraches) and if I'm judging it against legit Mexican in other areas of the country, it's probably a 3.",

What I would recommend is the Tacos Mexica which are like regular tacos except there's some grilled brown cheese on there. The cheese adds a bit of saltiness, the browned part adds some crunch and the melty part underneath adds a nice creamy texture to the party. The carne asada is salty and has some nice savory bits from the char of the grill while the pastor is spicy and crunchy.This place is as good as the stuff you'd get at little taquerias on the southside of Chicago so I very highly recommend you stop in.",

Everything on the menu is great, but my absolute favorite is the fried tlacoyo with pastor.

Glad I found them because I had a killer lunch there and it only took about 15 minutes from start to finish.I walked in for a late lunch but the place was still swamped.  I didn't see a menu board but I did see a sign that instructed me to order at the register before finding a seat.  I asked the guy what was popular and he pointed me towards the Tacos Mexica.  I ordered those and he pointed me towards a nearby seat.  I noticed that the next few people in line behind me ordered in Spanish and took that as a good sign.Canned soda which translates to no refills but the chips and salsa assortment made up for that.  Their salsas are served in small ramekins, each with a little spoon.  They range from medium to hot and pack a lot of flavor. The Tacos Mexica are small \"street taco\" style tacos with a twist: they melt cheese on the corn tortillas before adding your choice of meat.  I went for carne asada, chorizo and al pastor.  I knew that I wouldn't make it through all three and the chorizo was the one that I decided to leave after a bite or two as a little chorizo goes a long way.  Of the three, the al pastor was the one that really stood out.  The pork was succulent and just a little bit spicy while the pineapple brought a delicious sweetness to each bite.  The onions added crunch while the fresh cilantro brought everything together.",

The only down side I can possibly think of is the fact that it's good is too good, and there will always be a line to place your order for food. But do not let that turn you away! You can always place your order early through phone and pick up your food when you arrive! That's what i do when I am tight on schedule. I honestly cannot recommend any specific dishes because they are all very good! I usually just ask the cashier what they are in the mood for, and I will take that recommendation. The restaurant itself is small so there is very little chance that you can actually sit down to eat on site. But if you do, definitely have their chips and salsa. They are worth every second of wait! They also provide some authentic Latino drinks that you do not usually see everywhere else!The price for the restaurant is definitely reasonable. It may be a little out of students way, but definitely worth the effort, especially if the weather is getting better!",

So you either are lucky to get a seat, or take it to go.  Service is friendly and knowledgeable with recommendations.  Food comes out piping hot before you know it.  Huge burritos, tortas, tostadas, flautas, etc, with some tacos and other various Mex offerings.  A torta is more of a pressed sandwich.  The chorizo is great, and the spicy torta is amazeballs.  Swimming in spicy pan drippings.  An excellent spot for anybody, but especially as a lunch spot for students during the school year.  So while the U of I is in session, this place is always packed.  Luckily I am usually up this way during the Christmas break and it is really chill.  One of the better spots in Chambana for a great lunch.",

There are exceptions to all good things, and your decision to serve a sandwich as a soggy concoction floating in broth makes your taqueria is one of them.",

I've been meaning to come here for several months, but based on the reviews, I decided to wait when school was out and campustown would be empty.   The parking lot is SMALL.   I mean like, 6 parking spots maybe.... so either get their early or park on the street somewhere and walk on over.   The restaurant is a little hole in the wall ex-diner/donut shop.... seating is super-limited.... again, maybe like 10 seats.... so your best bet is to probably eat in your car or on the curb.   The prices are very reasonable.... you'll fill yourself up easily for $10.   I got three tacos -- al pastor, fish and a rib eye.   They were authentic -- cilantro and onions... corn tortillas.   I could've eaten about 6 of them easily.  The rib eye was good, the al pastor was better and the fish was outstanding!   I got complimentary chips and salsas while I waited. They were good.... but not sure how fresh they were since they were already warming under the heat lamps when I sat down.   This is a GREAT Mexican restaurant.... but not sure if it's really worth venturing into campustown to MAYBE get a seat AND a parking spot.   You definitely don't want to be lugging around a baby in a baby carrier because they'll just wind up sitting next to you on the floor (limited space) --- I mean, like stretch your arms out to your side and that's probably the size of the dining space width-wise.    Don't even think about bringing a toddler here because again, they won't be able to sit still on the chairs for very long.   But if you're by yourself or with a small party, go for it!Other than that, there are other alternatives in town that are just as good (ok, no other place has fish tacos like these, but for other mexican fare, there are good alternatives) such as Taco Loco, the taco trucks (the Mas Amigos at Prospect and Bloomington, and whateveritscalled Taco Truck in the Springfield and County Fair Dr  area).",

(The chalupas especially... maybe I should fly back to Champaign for the weekend...) The people working were friendly and the service was prompt. Maize is, food-wise, one of the best places to eat in Champaign-Urbana.The only downside of this place is its tininess. There's room inside for about a dozen people sitting elbow to elbow. I always got takeout, and even standing around waiting for my order I always felt like I was in someone's way. The parking lot is proportionately small too, with only four or five spots, so you may not even be able to park at Maize to get takeout. (Fortunately it's within easy walking distance of campus, and the Green bus line goes right by so you might not have to drive.)

My favorite 1-2 punch is getting a burrito and quesadilla and eating the quesadilla late at night.Dining in can be kind of a chore as the place seriously fits about twelve people (not comfortably) but their takeout is fast and if you are a lazy repeat customer (like me), phone ordering takes less than a minute.  Add in the politeness of the staff and now you know why I eat here at least once a week...",

Sorry previous reviewer, this food is not anywhere near the level of Rick Bayless, and it's barely up to par with most solid taquerias in Chicago (and it's more expensive).Have you had the burrito? It's 75% lettuce, 20% sour creme, and a tiny sprinkling of salsa and meat. It's also fairly small, so you only end up with two or three bites of meat in the end. Such a letdown given how good their pastor and asada are - so get a taco where you can enjoy the flavor of the meat a bit more. The chorizo is greasy as all get out, which I know is somewhat a function of chorizo, but its not even all that delicious. The chicken is shredded and usually pretty good, but I've had it a few times where it's completely bland and over cooked. The chips are amazing and the guac is good - but again they cut it with lettuce! You get a decent portion, but it's scooped onto a giant pile of green lies that gives you bites of crispy watery blandness.I don't mind the small space, but I'm looking forward to their bigger restaurant next year. Yes, I'll keep coming here, but please stop watering down your food with lettuce.",

                "review": "First, Maize is very good in the authentic Mexican taqueria tradition. They have a number of grilled or fried items from which to choose, as well as  a couple of good sides like guacamole. On each item, you can choose from the following meats: carne asada, chicken, chorizo, or pastor. My favorite is the flavorful pastor (marinated roast pork). Common co-toppings include a wonderful fresh, salty cheese, salsa fresca, sour cream, and cilantro. A variety of salsa comes with, and each bite of every item is delicious, with or without the salsa, which is very good. Tacos, burritos, tostadas, tortas, tlacoyos, challupas, quesadillas, gorditas, flautas, and huarches are all available. Honestly, they are variations on a theme, rather than distinctively different. Choose your texture. I'm an especially big fan of the tlacoyos (stuff served on top of a piece of grilled chewy flat bread -- you can get the bread fried, but grilled is better). Some of the items do offer interesting add-ons. For example, you can add pumpkin flowers or or mushrooms to the quesadillas.Maize is located in a small converted space, with just a few seats around the main counter and a counter that runs immediately behind along the back wall. Seats are counter stools. At busy times, customers who are waiting for food get packed in too, or wait outside. The parking lot is equally small. We prefer to get our food to go, and it is always well worth the trip. Prices are inexpensive for the quality -- an excellent value.",

This isn't a fancy 5 star restaurant but that's not what the stars mean on Yelp- as we all (should) know!We moved here from Southern California in August, so it's safe to say we've had our share of excellent traditional Mexican food.  Since our first trip to Maize we go there at least once a week- it's so good.BE PREPARED: Parking can be a problem and it's almost always packed.  People frequently come in and order for takeout. In our experience, by the time we order a seat almost always clears up.  We have never taken it to go.  If you eat there, you get free (freshly made!) chips and salsa while you wait for your food.  Since it's just the two of us, we have always been lucky.  If you have a big group, I'd suggest ordering it to go and eating at home or having a picnic.  You can call your order in too, which is nice.The food is always ready super fast, so even if you order to go, you won't wait long.  The staff is extremely kind and happy to answer questions if you're not sure what something is.  I've tried many things on the menu but keep coming back to the tacos- chicken or fish are my fav- because of the RIDICULOUSLY amazing corn tortillas.  So. Good.Word on the street is that they'll be opening a larger location near the Amtrak in Champaign soon.",

When I leave Illinois in the near future, this will be the only thing I miss.  I actually cried the other day thinking about losing it.",

It was so busy 30 minutes into opening that we had to take our food to go. There is a wide selection of authentic mexican dishes. I ended up with a selection of tacos (steak, pork, and carnitas). Although they were soggy by the time I got home, the ingredients were so fresh and the flavor was perfect. Not too salty and rich in flavor. The prices are perfect a lot cheaper than Rick Bayless Xoco. I just wish it was easier to find parking or even space to eat in. You get chips and 2 types of salsa for free as well even if you are getting carry out. I was surprised I only got 1 bag even with four entrees. I will have to make sure I ask for more next time. Overall this is probably the best mexican restaurant I have ever been toPro: delicious mexican authentic and fresh Cons: very small parking lot and equally small dining areaHidden gem:Free salsa and chips",

                "review": "Mexican food that tastes authentic is hard to find. Maize is a place that is able to achieve this Mexican taste which is not drowned in cheeses or sauces which can ruin Mexican food. The menu is small and not complicated with straight forward Mexican food options. The food is also relatively cheap, for about eight dollars you can get a filling authentic meal. Best of all they make their own masa base, While waiting to order i saw a Mexican lady kneading a huge amount of masa dough for the tortillas, and even saw a man hand making the flautas. With fresh masa as a base of the dishes, it was hard to not order the whole menu to see the different applications of the masa doughI ordered three items from Maize. The first item I tried was the carne asade burrito. The first thing that I tasted was the juicy steak, it was seasoned well and very juicy. it was not dry and burned as if it had been sitting in a tray just waiting to be reheated multiple times.  The beans, lettuce and the queso fresco help to bring a balance of creaminess, saltiness and crunch to the burrito. The burrito is also a great value at five dollars, it is quite hefty with plenty of juicy steak in it which is always key. I next had the Tlacoyo with chorizo on it. The chorizo was a great highlight. It was not dry and very flavorful. Many places when cooking chorizo overcook so it gets burned. The chorizo also was not overly greasy. The Tlacoyo was stuffed with beans fried and topped with sourcream and a blend of cilantro and onions and chorizo. The Tlacoyo looked like a tostada but with Masa that is fried. he saltiness of the chorizo blended well with the sourcream and onions which made me wish I had ordered more. When you bite into it, you first get a crunchy bite with  the Masa and then chorizo, sourcream and onions melding with it to give you a perfect crunchy bite. For three dollars, it it quite satisfying. The last item I ordered was a chicken huaraches. The huaraches are similar but are not studded with beans. This item was also quite good, the chicken moist and tender. The vegetables on it tasted fresh as the tomatoes were still firm when eating the huaraches. i got the huaraches grilled instead of fried and it made the masa more moist and chewy, almost like a pita. Having the huarache grilled, was a palate cleaner as it had certain freshness of summer food in the winter time. i think even Anthony  Bourdain would love eating at this place. The food this laces produces looks similar to the food he eats on his shows.  This Mexican places is a small restraint with barely any room to sit, but its simple Mexican flavors will have me coming back to eat.",

My first thought was \"Wow, they weren't kidding when they said that it's small.\" It seems like a perfect place to get food to-go and seating is very limited.I ordered a burrito with pastor and my friend ordered torte with pastor. The food was really well priced and arrived at the speed of light! We had a seat at the counter and ate our meals there. The staff quickly served up our Jarritos (before we sat down even) and chips together with a delicious spicy habanero (I think) sauce. We were both satisfied with the burrito and the torte and enjoyed our dinner at Maize. Highly recommended if you're looking for a quick, delicious, affordable meal!",

Once I came before the dinner rush so it was easy to get seats, and the second time was during the lunch rush so we had to wait around for people to leave. Love the chips and salsa they give you when you dine in, and the guacamole is bomb. From my two visits, I've decided the tacos are the most authentic I've ever had. So simple, corn tortilla topped with meat, onions, and cilantro, but so, so delicious. The first time, I had a ribeye, fish, and chicken taco. I still remember my first bite of a Maize taco and thinking holy mother this is good! The chicken was blackened and crispy and rich and oh so delicious. I was surprised how much I enjoyed the chicken taco, thinking it'd be the simplest of the three, but it ended up being so flavorful. The ribeye taco was also excellent. I love fish tacos in general, but my gripe with Maize's was that the texture was a tad on the mushy side and it was a little boring compared to the others. Probably will stick the meaty tacos from here on out. The second time, I ordered a ribeye and carne asada taco and a chicken tostada. Both tacos were excellent as expected, and I thoroughly enjoyed the carne asada. Tender and flavorful. I decided to give the tostada a try, and I'm glad I did. Crispy tortilla topped with beans, chicken, salsa, lettuce, and cheese. The chicken was different the second time, not as more like a pulled chicken, which was still delicious, but not the crispy blackened chicken I remember. The tostada was good, however, there was a little too much going on so I plan to stick to tacos in the future. Overall, I am so glad to have Maize on campus. It is cheap, authentic, and delicious.

Great value (burrito and chips are under $6) when weighting portions, price, and quality. And you get fresh, warm, homemade chips and their own unique salsa free with every burrito order. Their service is quick and their staff is friendly. Townies know to call ahead and order your food if you are going to do takeout. Then when you get there you can just walk right in, pay, and leave! If your in Chambana and havent tried this place you are missing out!",

The menu is extremely simple to navigate, and the ladies who work the register are very kind and helpful. On most days, I eat the veggie burrito here, and I'm always elated to eat it. It's cheaper than Chipotle, and that much tastier!Do note that the restaurant is extremely small, so seating may be tough to find at peak hours, but it is 100% always worth the wait.I made it a point to go to this restaurant weekly instead of attending one of my lectures. That was one of the best decisions of my life.",

I have to assume I'm missing something for this place to be getting such rave reviews. I am a taco fiend and wasn't impressed, especially with the fantastic El Charro being right down the street. I ordered two of their \"Taco Mexica\" with chicken, because I'd heard good things about their \"grilled cheese taco.\" The chicken was shredded and barely had any taste to it, which docks major points in my book. There was basically no seasoning in the meat at all, which is why El Charro wins the chicken taco contest by a landslide. The grilled cheese taco thing was interesting, but I honestly couldn't taste the cheese much, and I covet my cheese, so again, I didn't love it.  The traditional cilantro and onions topping gave it props in my book, but without tasty meat, what's the point? Maybe their beef is the way to go. They include free chips and salsa with your order, and here again I was disappointed. (I'm such a jerk judging free food, aren't I?) The salsa just wasn't my style. I'm basically obsessed with the tomatoey, cilantro-filled stuff El Toro will dole out for free, and I just can't get into spicy traditional salsa. That's a personal preference, though. The guacamole looked really good, but it was mighty expensive. It's $5.95 served with chips, and you get a giant saucer of it, but El Toro serves up some great guac at only $3.50. (And of course you get free chips and salsa at El Toro.)I might go back only to try out their fish tacos and guac, just to give the place one more shot. Good fish tacos is the only thing C-U is missing as far as Mexican food goes.",

Disappointed in two of my favorite restaurants, we shuffled off to try Maize. First of all, for such cramped quarters, service was really great. The waitress was prompt and friendly -- even though my standards may have been a bit lowered by circumstance, it was still more than I would expect from a hole-in-the-wall place like this.

Tasty, authentic and very friendly. My only complaint is that there is so little seating we can't take our kids there to eat - we'll have to do takeout.",

First off, they messed up my order as the taco wasn't carne asada.  Then when I sent it back and it returned, the meat was carne asada, but was covered in onions.  By this point, I was over it, so I didn't bother to send it back a third time- just didn't eat it.  I was expecting more from this place because of all of the rave reviews.  To be honest, my quesadilla was really oily (on the outside!) and extremely bland. It was missing heat, spice, anything to liven up the taste.  Overall, I wasn't too impressed and doubt I'll be back. It just wasn't all that.",

It's everything you'd want from a Mexican place, provided you're not looking for a full service sit-down restaurant. My chorizo burrito was excellent (the tortilla alone was incredible!) and I also tried the fried mushroom quesadilla, which was positively dreamy. It's greasy street food, but that's exactly what you want sometimes, and the flavors are authentic. As for service, it's speedy and accommodating -- the place was packed when I realized I'd forgotten to ask for my receipt. I'd placed my order a half hour earlier, yet the employee cheerfully created a new receipt for me... accurately, from memory no less, in the midst of a huge back-up at the counter. From now on, I'll never miss an opportunity to eat here whenever I come to the area. What a gem!",

The place is small, so we tend to call in our order and show up to pick it up. When we've ordered on site, there was usually a line, but the wait was never too long and the food was always worth it. Our favorite item there is the fish tacos, but we also enjoy the chips and salsa. This is definitely the top Mexican place in my opinion and it is super affordable and tasty.",

Some different menu items than your typical champaign el toro/terero/etc.THE BAD:I truly believe this place chose such a small venue to give the illusion of a busy restaurant to generate buzz about their business. STAY OR GO?: I would not go back to this place. Mexican tastes ALMOST the same everywhere you go in town. Other places in town you get to sit, be served, and relax (and the price is about the same).",

My steak tacos tasted like paper with a taste of cilantro and onion(hint of salt might helped and maybe not forgetting to add a couple lime would help). Steak felt chewy. Just didnt have any flavor. My son complained he didnt like his chicken quesadilla and I believed  him when i tried it. Someone over loaded with salt. Condiments like hot sauce tasted like water down vinegar. My family said the salsa tasted like water and a hint of tomatoes but chips was great. Probably would never go back. I recommend getting new cooks or someone with better taste buds.  Im from California and this is the worst Mexican food i had so far.",

It's super small with just about 15 bar style seats in the place. All it needs is to be completely outside, and that's as authentic as it gets!My partner got the tacos al pastor and said they were just as goods as ones we had in Mexico. I opted for the potato flautas and they were pretty good as well. They came on a full plate with rice, beans, pico de gallo, and guac and I'm not gonna lie, it's a lot of food, but its perfect. I wasn't a huge fan of the rice, but I'm really picky when it comes to Mexican rice. I did like the potato chunks in it though. You get chips and salsa set in front of you almost the minute you sit down (if you're lucky enough to get a seat), the food comes out ridiculously fast, and it's good authentic Mexican food. I will definitely go back whenever I'm in town.",

It's interesting, local, affordable, and quite possibly the perfect lil' lunch stop in Champaign.Here's what you need to know: this place is teeny. Tiny. Since I've only been once, I can't say for sure, but my hunch is that during peak hours it can be tough to find a place to sit. There are only a handful of seats in the place to begin with, but with the rush I saw on weekday at lunch, I was darn lucky to grab a few seats at the counter that attaches to the wall, looking out.Cramped quarters notwithstanding (and truthfully, they sorta add to the charm), there's plenty to like. To my surprise, they actually bring out some chips and salsa, and it's a real plate kind of place. I thought that with its small size, you'd just see things served in paper trays or wrapped in paper. But I like the hospitality of real dishes and the extra nibbles while you wait for your food.Even though the menu looks familiar--you've got your burritos and tacos and quesadillas--it's not the same ol' Americanized stuff. No, it's got some creativity to it. It's got some food service sensibility to it. Where else can you find squash blossom or huitlacoche quesadillas? Oh, and get the latter. Darn good. I'm not terribly familiar with different regions of Mexico, but the food here struck a chord as being tied more to Mexico, D.F., than say, something more provincial. I'm out on a limb exposing my ignorance, but that's my timid notion.My burrito was the bizness. Not overly stuffed and the size of an infant, but rather, reasonably portioned, full of flavor, and still plenty of layers so it didn't become monotonous munching. I opted for pastor, but they've got other choices for meat, or you can go meatless.You can probably go back a few times and it feels interesting. The menu is varied enough to be interesting and enticing, but not to overly wrought so they can't focus. They keep it simple, but save a few tricks for the observant orderer.",

Chips and salsa were delivered almost instantly (and free) when we sat down and noticed that's the standard here.

Prices and food both good, bordering on great! +1 (I had the burrito and a taco americano with chorizo, the burrito was delish and would have been enough by itself )5.).

It is the only Mexican place that does not taste as if the food just got re-heated in the microwave. While they are not as cheap the other Mexican places in town, the quality by far trumps the cost and quantity you would receive at other places. I have tried a variety of their items. I really like their fish tacos and veggie burritos. The sopes are very delicious as well. Also, the hot and mild sauces that come with the tortilla chips are very good. As stated in all the other reviews, this place is very small and have limited (3) parking spots, making it very hard to obtain food when you have a craving for it. You can always call in your order for pick-up but there is still the issue of finding parking to go pick you food up. What I would suggest is they get a FOOD TRUCK that is goes around campus town, where they make some real bank. Despite this big negative of space and parking, the food makes for a worthwhile trip.",

We were driving through Illinois on our way to Wisconsin and read some positive yelp reviews and decided to try Mexican for lunch!Yes, it is very small and you need to wait your turn for seating, but the turnover was quick and once we sat down we got our drinks and free chips and salsa immediately (great chips and two sauces).My husband ordered the carne asada torta ahogada. And it was huge and he said the special spicy sauce was perfect: hot AND tons of flavor. He also ordered the chalupas. There were actually three per plate-it was probably the best shaved pork I've ever had. Either of those dishes alone would have made a substantial size lunch. I ordered the chicken gordita (I think it was supposed to come with beans, but I'm glad it didn't, the chicken was so flavorful and enough on it's own). Lastly (I know we were pigs today!) we had a beef volcane. The volcane was probably our least favorite, but the tortilla it was on, and the cheese it was covered in, were delicious (not soggy at all).Highly recommend for a low-key, cheap, fun, filling meal!",

I met the owner once to interview him for Best of CU for Buzz, and he was the sweetest guy from Mexico City. He recommends the authentic fish tacos. I love their pumpkin flower and corn fungus quesadillas and their chicken volcanes, but all their menu items are perfectly delicious. All orders come with a side of chips with two types of lip-smacking salsa.Rather long wait sometimes, but just go at odd hours or endure the wait. They have an array of authentic Mexican sodas waiting inside as well. Seating is rather fickle and sparse, so get ready to carry out unless you're eating plus one. Enjoy!",

The atmosphere was intimate, the parking lot was packed, there were no available stools.  We overheard a customer who had been there before gushing to his friends about what to order.  So I get the impression this is one of those start-ups that folks feel strongly about supporting and want to see succeed. Me too.Small portions, but very reasonably priced (most things under $3).  Spend $8 and you will have a full meal.  The free chips are unique because they have dark specks in them and seem drier and crunchier than other Mexican restaurants in this genre. The free salsa is excellent.",

The only thing I tried that was ok was a Mexican Taco, but everything else I tried (a couple of burritoes and different tacos) are not appealing at all. Meat is dry and has ligaments in it, not enough veggies, and just weird weird taste.",

Keep in mind if you dine in, you get unlimited salsa. Granted, I understand the need to recoup costs on the small (tiny!!!) plastic containers of salsa, but $0.50!?!?! As someone who eats here 3-6 times a month, it's upsetting that they don't value their repeat customers. At least have some type of free extra salsa every 3 order type of program. It's pretty ridiculous to think that ONE TINY salsa container will due a burrito and chips justice. As much love as Maize gets form the CU community, you'd think they'd find a way to reciprocate. Unfortunately, not quite the case yet.",

This place is located on an intersection and parking is very tricky. It is almost always full of students for two reasons, one is their food quality and two is the prices. I don't think the quantity of food is too much so there is nothing left to take home at the end. Nice and clean location with limited sitting. They have different menu choices but basically the same food arranged in different way. That doesn't make is less tasty. Actually food is delicious in all forms and I highly recommend you try all of the different forms of your favorite meat or vegetarian dish. They keep this place tidy despite being very busy and having rapid turn over of customers.",

We sat down in the world's tightest restaurant imaginable and they brought us chips and salsa and water. The water was luke warm just like the salsa. There was enough chips to feed a small baby. As frequent Mexican food goers my boyfriend and I were expecting bottomless chips and salsa that we could smash for 10 minutes before the food came. He asked for another round of chips and salsa and they looked at us like we were nuts. Then the food came and I looked down at the meat and the first thing I saw was fatty meat that was grey. It was super gross looking. I took a bite and it was pretty delicious. However I had to spend some time picking out the gross fatty pieces. As for coming back in the future.. not for awhile. My boyfriend and I can get Chipotle burritos with guac for that price so that is what we will most likely do. To be honest, it was disappointing since I thought it was supposed to be one of the best Mexican restaurants in the U.S..",

I wish they just had more seating and were able to offer a dinner type atmosphere and menu. Great lunch and cheap dinner food. They are missing a lot of dinner items such as  enchiladas, mole, or pozole. However, everything they do do, they do it right. Their salsas are great, their tortillas delicious.

I'd go back when I'm around again.well deserving of being best mexican cuisine in CU",

The meat (steak) was flawed on many levels. It is a poor cut, not carne asada but something cheaper. The burrito here is small and there is very little meat to begin with. I also tried the tacos and they too were bland. The guacamole is alright and the sauces add some flavor. I am not sure why everyone thinks, writes highly of this place. The owner should do justice and actually use descent meat and not rubbish. You are not doing a service to anyone except your bank account. Sad. TBK would be put this place to shame.",

The staff is super friendly and helpful and will answer any questions you have. If you are short on time, this is a great place to go since the food comes out FAST, unless you have to wait in a huge line to place your order.I tried a fish taco and a pastor tlacoyo, both are items I have not seen on menus at Mexican restaurants around town. They were both very tasty and authentic. The sauce on the pastor tlacoyo was delicious and I was delighted by the authentic cheese and crema topping.  Chips and salsa were good, but they're not my favorite in town.I would go back and try their torta and any entree that has squash blossom or huitlacoche.",

When I unwrapped my food, I was disappointed to see 3 puney little tacos. They look like tacos you'd order off of some sort of kids meal. Not only were these tacos small but they were dripping in grease! I love my greasy, unhealthy foods as much as the next guy, but these tacos made me feel absolutely disgusting and sick afterwards just from all the grease. It wasn't even worth it because these were the most bland tacos I've ever had. Probably one of the most bland things I've ever tasted period!  I don't understand how meat can be that bland. Even unseasoned meat isn't that flavorless..I've given this place another try because of all the good reviews. Although the food I ordered on the 2nd and 3rd time had more flavor and were a more acceptable portion size, it had even more grease. My boyfriend couldn't stomach them either. We ended up just throwing the food out..",

I went to school at UoI and most of the places are poor Tex-Mex at best, so my expectations were low.  However, this place made me feel that I was visiting our neighbors to the south. The seating is minimal so you may want to take it to go but should you find a seat you'll be able to watch freshly made food fly out of their kitchen with expediency.  I had a pastor burrito that was sensational, the pork had the perfect amount of spicy without detracting from the other flavors.  Sour cream complimented the vegetables and pork well without adding to much cream and the sides of salsa wear well balanced with a little heat.  The most overwhelming feature for me was the observance of them preparing made from scratch tortillas for each order; light but interestingly hearty these had a fantastic corn flavor which was better than any tortilla I've ever had.  As mentioned before, I'm a Texas Mexican food snob and this place honestly floored me.  I don't come back to my Al ma mater often but next time I do I'll go here.",

                "review": "My brother (Pat E., Elite Yelper, Pancake Lover) suggested we try Maize for lunch instead of our usual SUnday fare (eggs, pancakes). Our stomaches have been programmed to eat brunch style food on Sundays for as long as I remember. I'll be honest, I was a bit nervous going for Mexican, but it turned out to be a great choice!We arrived around 12:30 on a Sunday afternoon. The restaurant was jam packed, which is not surprising because it's the size of a panic room. There's about 12-15 seats total in the place, and it's definitely crammed. They are actually in the process of opening up a sit down place in the area, and per one of the workers, it's in the final stages of opening. This was my bro's 2nd time here, so he took the lead. He ordered a ribeye taco, a fish taco, a hultihoche (corn smut) quesadilla, and a steak tlacoyo. The tlacoyo is bascially an open faced taco.I ordered a steak (carne asada taco), a chorizo taco, a pumpkin flower quesadilla, and a pork (pastor) tlacoyo. We both decided to ask for our sour cream on the side for our tlacoyos, because we like being in control, and we wanted to use the SC for other dishes.Only one word can describe my meal: A-MAIZE-ING (I'm sure I'm the first person to use this)!Our food came out promptly. Our drinks were always full, and everything was extremely flavorful, including the salsas that came with our chips (we each had a few).The tacos were topped with cilantro and onions. Quick note: Everything here is made with corn tortillas (get that white crap outta here!) Also, gluten free, if you swing that way. The carne asada was so good, and they didn't skimp on the portion size either! The chorizo was zesty but not spicy, which I preferred. I was expecting it to be sliced up like a sausage, but it was actually ground chorizo. Either way, the tacos were amazing! My only complaint.... too small! But for 2.25 a taco, a very fair price.The pastor tlacoyo was the first dish I actually dove into. Topped with cheese, I added my sour cream quite liberally anyways, and I did not regret it! The pork did not have as much flavor as the other meats, but that's not to say it was bad. Still very good!! I added the darker salsa to the tlacoyo, which may have masked the flavor of the pork, but I'm not sure. You have the option of grilled or fried for this dish, and I went with grilled.Finally, to the quesadilla, my favorite part of the meal. Filled with cheese and pumpkin flower, this was the best tasting dish for me. I also liked how the quesadilla came with lettuce and tomato, which can be placed on top or eaten by itself, which is what I did, along with the lighter salsa. At the end of the meal, I added sour cream to the top, which was amazing!All in all, our 8 dishes added up to 25 dollars. Very reasonable for the amount of food! If you decide to eat here, yes, it's cramped, but I thought it was a cool experience. I thought it was weird how a group of 3 adults came with a baby, and nestled up in the corner. Not really a great place for kids, let alone babies.There were plenty of to go orders being placed and picked up while we were there. They are very fast in the kitchen!Highly recommended! After my last mexican dining experience (Fernando's in Chicago), this was the polar opposite. Great food, service, prices, and memorable, for all the right reasons. I can't wait to head back for my next visit!",

The burritos are passable, but stick with the tacos if you want rather authentic Mexican food.  The price is not the cheapest compared to say, Dos Reales (another decent Mexican place in town), you do not get any sides and the drinks do not come with refills.  However, it is definitely more authentic.  Dining in at this place might feel rushed since it is so small - best get your food to go.",

Decent prices. Friendly staff. Chips and salsa with every order.

You'll basically get the item with NO MEAT, just the toppings listed, even though you pay the same price as one with meat.

I got lucky and pulled into one with my tiny Kia Soul that barely squeezed into the spot on the end simultaneously pissing off the other 12 cars trying to figure out how to park at this establishment and not having much luck.Overall, The food is great, get it to go and walk there if you can because you are not going to find a place to park.",

I was so happy that tortillas are freshly made and they also have horchata. I will definitely travel to this place again.",

I frequently get takeout here for lunch, and sometimes i've even had it twice in one day when my family wanted to have it for dinner on the same day I had it for lunch! It's best if you call first, because it's a tiny space and in bad weather you might have to stand outside a bit.  My favorite items are the tacos (usually chorizo or pastor), and fried or grilled quesadillas.  I've had the chicken, asada, and fish as well and all are good, but my favorite is the chorizo!   Taco mexica is a taco with browned cheese on the inside, and those are very good as well.   We've had the nachos as a dinner item, but I didn't care for those as much.   Fresh chips and salsa come with your order.  I don't care for the watery tomato salsa at all, but the darker (maybe tamarind?) salsa is great and pretty spicy.  They also have horchata, which is probably from a mix, but the fact that they have it is a plus.Definitely recommend getting it to go when school is in session and weather is nice, because it's quite crowded at lunch.  Parking is limited, so good luck!",

The good things about Maize: (1) Maize had fresh ingredients.  The cilantro tasted like it had just been harvested from a garden this morning.  Seriously.  Most of the other Mexican restaurants in the area either do not use cilantro or use barely any at all, so Maize's generous serving of fresh cilantro was a definite plus.(2) Maize appeared very sanitary and clean.  Some the restaurants on campus are somewhat grungy, but this restaurant seemed very well-kept and clean.(3) The decor and music put me in a very good mood.  From the outside, Maize may look a bit drab, but once you are inside, it's bright and colorful. I kind of wish the place were bigger and had more parking, but I don't really think it's a huge deal.  The small size of the restaurant gives it \"character.\"",

Despite all these cons, you can never go wrong when ordering food here. They handle long lines really well. That have gotten used to long lines. My favorite thing to get here is their torta de milanesa. Their chips are really good; They might be a little greasy for some people but I can't get enough of them. They give you two different types of salsa with your food and both of them are really good. Their menu is simple and easy to understand. They also have your classic Mexican sodas. The prices of all their food is cheep. I would pay more for the quality of the food they provide. I hope that in the future they expand their restaurant because the food, service, and environment is really good. If you don't know what to get you should try their quesadillas.",

It's across the street from Dominos on Green St.  Decently fast service - took just under 10 minutes to get 2 tacos and a deep fried quesadilla (say it like Napoleon Dynamite's grandma). The tacos are somewhat authentic w/ cilantro / lime / onion.  They put mayonnaise (interesting) on under the meat on the tortilla, but it was hardly tasted. My big complaint is the tacos and quesadilla were extremely dry.  They have two salsas - an orange and yellow colored salsa.  The salsa tasted good on the chips, but not good enough or complimentary for the entree.  The girl who took everyone's order was very nice so customer service was good.  Lastly, the restaurant only seats 12-14 people (elbow to elbow) so eat out if you wish.   Ultimately I would not eat here again, but if you read other reviews and decide I'm off my rocker, take it to go and buy an extra bottle of water because your mouth will be dry after eating.",

The nachos are also very good!- Complimentary chips and salsa! They give two types of salsa, one mild and one hot. - Most importantly, the food is very fresh! It's always made to order, and comes out hot!- It is very price conscious also!The Bad:- It is very, very small. Maybe fifteen seats available at the most, and unless you time it perfectly, you probably won't get a seat. However, they do have take out available, if that option works for you.Overall:Very good Mexican food at a good price. My S.O. and I have been here numerous times, and will certainly be back again.",

In a nutshell, it's the kind of amazing Mexican place that I remember from my youth in California. I never thought I'd find anything like it in the midwest.  After eating at Maize I may never be able to eat at another mexican place in Champaign-Urbana -- they all compare so poorly to this one.  Beware, once you eat here there's no going back!I have tried the fancier and more exotic fillings on the menu (the pumpkin flower and the mushroom) and the more authentic formats for them (huaraches, taco mexico) and they were all good, but I liked the \"standards\" even better. If I were you, I'd start with the simplest: tacos pastor with cilantro and onions. Amazing!  Just amazing.",

The fish tacos are my go-to, but each one is kind of small, so if you are hungry, I suggest getting 2 or 3. The prices are amazing considering how much you get. Each meal comes with complimentary chips and two kinds of salsa, one hot and one mild. The chips are delicious, and I think that they are homemade (or at least they taste like they are!). The staff are very friendly, and they will help you navigate the menu if it is your first time. They are also very fast. My whole family had food in front of us in about 3 minutes. It's definitely not the best place to go if you are looking to sit down for a long lunch, because there are very few seats in the place, and not much standing room. There are a few picnic tables outside, which are nice if it is a warm day out. I prefer getting my food to go, but I have sat there a few times, and it has been really nice! Overall, I would recommend this place to anybody coming through town, or to other students who haven't been yet! Absolutely worth it!",

We entered the restaurant and the place was packed. It was about 6:30. We didn't have to wait long before they offered us a table in the bar room. The ambience was nice and the food was delicious.Our wait staff was a little slow and it took them a while to come around to refill our water and our bread basket, but the entree and overall experience made up for it.I ordered their white sangria. I must tell you that if you like sweet and fruity drinks, definitely order it it. It was so good that my friends decided to order it as their second drink.For our food, we decided to start off with the Coconut-crusted shrimp with orange-jalapeo dipping sauce. It was pretty good. The best part was the sauce.My entree, I ordered the Phyllo-wrapped lamb loin filled with goat cheese, rosemary, and coriander, served with red-skin mashed potatoes and port reduction. It it a mouthful to say and I must say that it is worth every word. The lamb was cooked perfectly and all the sides were very complimentary. I would definitely order this dish again.Overall, I give this place an A. I would definitely go back to try all the other dishes on their menu.",

Tasty, but not the best I've ever had.Entrees: The seafood paella is not a paella; its a bunch of seafood in a pot, with rice and sauce buried at the bottom. It was a beautiful presentation, and the seafood was cooked well but woefully underseasoned. None of the sauce touched the seafood, and the sauce was sub-par at best. It's Latin American food, right? Seasoning?!The phylo-wrapped lamb is an inventive dish, and beautifully presented. I think their chef went to beauty school, not culinary school. Again, underseasoned and the glaze seemed to be missing something...salt probably. Drinks: The mango margarita tasted like it was laced with lighter fluid or nailpolish remover. Their wine selection was really good.",

Meat dishes like the Hanger Steak Asada and osso bucco contained tasty prepared meat that was very tender to the fork and deliciously prepared vegetables and potato on the side. The seafood dishes like the sauteed shrimp and scallops and seafood paella also contained nice large juicy pieces of seafood, although only a few pieces. The rice on the paella as surprisingly flavorful although a little wet. The crema catalana I tried was also prepared very nicely with a crunchy caramelized sugar top over tasty custard that wasn't too thick and tempered with just the right amount of citrus. Overall, the food texture, temperature, and flavor was great -- however the small portion sizes for the price make me hesitant to award the final star.",

However, the sauce was poured over a very small half chicken with skin and bones resulting in little meat and lots of picking through the skin and bones to find said meat.  The fresh squeezed limeade could have used more lime juice.The restaurant itself is comfortable and inviting.  Service was excellent.",

We got there before the dinner rush and there were several empty tables so we were seated qucikly.  The waiter came to our table right away and told us about the specials etc.  We ordered drinks and our dinner and still the resturant was not quite half full.  We waited for our meal as the resturant filled up.  We knew it would take a little longer than chain resturants as the food was cooked to order and that was ok, but 50 minutes late we were still waiting and realized that most people around us had their meal already. that was about the time the waiter came up to let us know the \"computer had eaten our order and it had been so long since it took the order he forgot what we'd ordered\"  We should have left at that point, but didn't, and re-ordered.  There was no rush placed on our dinners as people who we heard order at that time got their food just before we did.  In all we waited an hour and 20 minutes to get our food.  Before the waiter told us our order had been eaten the service was great and glasses were kept full, after that we only saw him when we got our food and check.  I sort of expected them to discount the meal.  We'd put almost 2 hours on the meter (as the lot was full) and barely made it back before our time expired.  I'll probably go back for lunch, but I doubt they will make the cut for dinner again :(",

This was my first trip to escobar but middle son, who had been there before, refused to go because he claimed the atmosphere was too uninviting.  This was unusual for him to refuse to go out because he is a serious boy-about-town and never misses an opportunity to experience anything.OK, i'm sorry to say the aesthetic sensibilities of my 12 year old are a bit more fine tuned than whoever designed the interior of this restaurant.  It's all hard surfaces so the feel is very cold and extremely loud.  I asked my husband twice throughout the meal if he would be mad at me if I asked the people at the table next to us to stop laughing in such an annoying pitch.  Since he reminded me that i am not Larry David and nobody would find it funny, i refrained.  onto the food.  we had a spinach salad with mangos, shrimp, cucumbers, and red onions in a citrusy dressing.  this was good.  definitely fresh.  then we had a grouper over rice with veggies...eh, it was ok.  very large portions as in enough to feed 2 hungry adults, which worked well since we shared everything.  the fish was very fresh though so i give it 4 stars for that.  then we ordered coffee and bananas flambe.  the coffee had to be sent back because it was so weak and instead we ordered espressos.  i rarely ever send anything back probably because i hate wasting anything, but this was reeeeeeeeeeeeeally bad coffee.  Our waitress even agreed that she has to doctor her coffee when she drinks it here due to the weakness.  But the bananas and the caramel sauce...now that is worth 4 stars.  Would i go back?  No.  Should you try it?  Yes.  There seemed to be a lot of people there having a good time, laughing loudly.",

As is the case with Milo's, the dressings on the salads were divine.  Escobar's is not cheap, so minus one star, but it's a great destination for those special evenings when you are willing to spend some money on a nice meal out.  The white sangria was particularly noteworthy.My complaints would be that they were stingy with the bread.  They only gave us three slices of bread, a boring white and wheat and then some sort of corn foccicia thing that was really good, but two of us had to split a small piece so I really didn't get to enjoy it.  Also, on the jicama orange salad I had, they served the orange in slices rather than segmenting them.  This meant chewing on nasty orange membranes instead of simply enjoying the lovely combination of flavors in the salad.  I know it's probably more labor intensive for the kitchen, but when a diner pays $7 for a salad, you need to segment the damn oranges.  Overall though, these were really small things that really didn't damage my overall enjoyment of the evening.  My entree and dessert were absolutely wonderful, and the service couldn't have been better.  The food wasn't spicy at all, but was still very flavorful.  I personally would like to see a little kick added to some of the dishes, but it would be icing on the cake and they are fine without it.All in all, I really enjoyed my dinner at Escobar's and plan to go back.  It's not cheap, so I won't be a regular, but I certainly plan on coming here for birthday dinners and the like.",

It's nicely done but unpretentious. The wait staff was incredibly friendly. Refills were quick in coming and we got our food very quickly. As you waited you are served a basket of various tasty breads.We started with the coconut shrimp. It was absolutely delicious with huge, perfectly cooked shrimp covered in a tasty coating. The coating was very light and wasn't as sweet as some coconut shrimp can be (I think that was a plus) and it was served with a slightly spicy sauce and and a small bed of greens, onions and mango. The flavors were spot on. You only get four shrimp total but the shrimp are quite large and it was a good size portion for an appetizer.I had the chicken mol for my entree. Finally I have found a good mol in Champaign! I seriously had given up hope of finding a decent version of this sauce here, let alone an excellent version. I've tried just about ever mol sauce in town and it's almost universally bland with little more flavor than the sauce black beans are canned in. But this sauce had a great smokiness, a slight cinnamon undercurrent and the perfect amount of spice. It's served over two large pieces of chicken, still on the bone. The chicken was wonderfully cooked. The presentation was also a plus. It was served with Mexican rice, black beans, cooked fresh vegetables,  a fresh salsa and two large plantain chips all on a banana leaf-covered plate. The portion is nicely sized. Every element of this dish was superb. I really cannot find a fault with any of it and everything went so well together. The vegetables were even cut beautifully!My dining companion had the lamb dish and from the bite I had it was phenomenal as well. We finished off the night by sharing the chocolate-covered orange cake with raspberry cream. I would probably be a little afraid of how something like that might turn out if the meal I'd had wasn't so delicious. The desert did not disappoint.It's not a cheap place to eat dinner, although I took a look at their carry out lunch menu and they had some really great options all in the $10 - $11 range. And sometimes you really do get what you pay for.",

I called back a week before we went to make sure they didn't screw up our reservation. They assured me that the reservation was still there.Well, it wasn't. They screwed up our reservation, and we had to wait till 9:10 pm to be seated. The group ahead of us, who DIDN'T make a reservation, got a table before us. I asked if there's a point at all to make a reservation, and the owner stuttered. The owner then attempted to seat 5 of us at a small table meant for 4 at most which I thought was a little ridiculous. Being a server myself, I could've found a better spot ESPECIALLY when there's an empty 2-person table that could easily be joined to my table. FYI, the place was busy, but it was NOT packed since it's 8:30 pm on a Sunday night. The also had a special graduation menu which is almost identical to the regular menu but pricier. Food was good, but not great. We got 2 appetizers and 5 dishes, and we all sampled each other's. I liked the duck and the tilapia entree the most. I don't think anyone liked the chicken with mole sauce at all, but at least it was tenderly cooked. I got the red sangria which I didn't really like, but my dad did.This place didn't blow me away like I hoped it would. I've had better food in Champaign.",

The chef poured the corn cream sauce on half of the talapia. A simple and wonderful idea that let us enjoy the dinner in different ways. The side vegetable mix was great too. Obviously cut and cooked right before the meal. The better half had a steak with a port reduction sauce. Same fresh vegetable mix. Note, I mentioned to the waitress I do not like peppers. Without asking she made sure there were none in my dinner vegetables. Good, thoughtful service. Wine menu was OK, but would not stop us from coming back. Easy parking. Outside seating.",

She's a no-nonsense, straight-up pro that can take in a mouthful of wine and nail the flavor notes without all the swirling and sniffing and sloshing. It's the only time I've been able to say, \"this one tastes like a chewy, sweaty S&M jock strap\" and have someone know exactly what I mean without further explanation. And despite the fact that she's a beer girl, her vino recommendations (granted the list is not as extensive as other places downtown) are excellent.I've done a few different things on the menu but I always go back to their duck a l'orange. The meat is always cooked to succulent perfection and maybe it's because everything on the plate is a shade of orange but the entire dish tastes juicy, earthy, bright and warm. Like 6pm sunshine! Like it's made from Care Bears! I want to liquify it, put it in an IV and jack the whole tasty lot right into my veins!The mussels are excellent as well and my friend scarfed the ceviche on our last visit (I had my face in the mussels - so much for sharing).The bread is baked in house and they have a bombin' spicy corn focaccia so it's easy to load up on table bread guilt-free because you can't nosh on Escobar bread anywhere else but Escobar's.Most importantly I like this place because the food is so good and the staff is so nice that it doesn't need all the flash and glam of other restaurants to earn five stars on yelp! The closest comparison I have is the cluster of restaurants out in Napa: sun-drenched, family-owned, friendly and in an epic love affair with food. Outdoor seating means gazing into a parking lot as cars zoom by but it is still the only place in Champaign where I am a little saddened at the end of my meal because I don't have four stomachs, four wads of cash and four hours to sit and eat four more servings of Escobar's duck a l'orange.",

Yesterday I came in for brunch with visiting family on Easter, and our waitress was an embarrassment.  The food was good, but what strange service.    She was clearly on a diverse mix of prescription meds, because she had a hard time communicating with us.  The food was cold, because she brought it out one plate at a time for a group of 6, and proceeded to talk our face off as we were about to leave, despite being cold and indifferent during the rest of the meal. A little training might be in order here. Maybe you had the B-team on staff for Easter - but y'all need to check yourself before you wreck yourself.",

The waiter was very personable and helpful with suggestions and descriptions of dishes.  I started with a limeade, and my mom and sister had coffee -- a fantastic blend developed at the Columbia Street Roastery (which is next door).  We were served cornbread with orange zest mixed into the batter.  It was a little bit sweet for my taste (but I tend to prefer more savory cornbread in general).  We ordered platanos fritos, which were subtly spiced with cinnamon, and served with black beans on the side -- they went together surprisingly well.For brunch, I ordered the California Benedict -- avocado, asparagus, and a poached egg atop an english muffin, covered with a chile-spiced hollandaise sauce.  It was quite good -- I thought the little zip in the sauce complimented the eggs nicely, and helped to engage the palate more.  I was told that the crab cake sandwich and the salad with egg were delicious as well.  All told, we had a great meal -- the only complaint I have was that they did not serve all of the entrees at the same time (although the delay was not long, it did serve to make the eggs Benedict a little lukewarm by the time we all started eating).Anyway, to sum up, the atmosphere was nice, the prices reasonable, the service generally good (and always pleasant), and the food delicious -- I will definitely return here when I come to Champaign again!",

For lunch, you can't go wrong with the Cuban sandwich. It's been a staple in my diet the past 4 years. The fish tacos are the bees knees and when they have the seafood paella on the menu it's arguably the best dish in town. I highly encourage you all to try the calamari as an appetizer- it's a huge appetizer. I'm craving a Cuban sandwich now, hats off to you Escobar's",

This place is a bit more expensive than your standard restaurant in Champaign, but it is definitely worth it, if only for a treat every now and then. This place has excellent food and the amount is usually more than I can eat in one meal anyway.

The place was recommended to me by a friend as being one of the better restaurants in Champaign, and the menu online looked interesting, so I decided to give it a try for dinner. The restaurant is really big and was pretty empty when I went (around 8pm on a Tuesday night). After pigging out on the complimentary bread and drinking a mango margarita (tasty if a bit too sweet maybe), I started with an appetizer of fried calamari. I should better than to order seafood in the middle of Illinois: it was certainly not terrible, but it wasn't great either... a letdown for the calamari lover that I am. I then ordered the duck breast: the duck itself was not very good (not very tender and slightly overcooked), and it came with steamed vegetables (boring), mashed sweet potatoes (not bad but a little plain), fried plantain chips (good), and roasted pears (definitely the highlight of the dish: these were actually quite delicious). Overall... not a terrible entree but still quite disappointing and a little overpriced. To their defense, the portions were very large and I was completely stuffed by the time I left the restaurant.

The duck taquitos were dry, like frozen ones that were microwaved a little too long. (And they still sold for around $10 for two taquitos.) And the seafood in the paella ($21) was overcooked, and in a sauce that tasted a lot like Chef Boyardee sauce.My colleagues enjoyed the fish filet dishes, though, so perhaps it may be best to just avoid the dishes mentioned above.Besides that, friendly service and a good beer selection.",

It was very cute.However, when we were seated, it took a very long time for our waiter to get to us.  The busboy also kind of tossed/threw the bread bowl on the table which was weird and definitely made me raise an eyebrow.We ordered the guacamole appetizer and a caesar salad to start; my boyfriend ordered the hanger steak and I got the mushroom enchilada.  The guacamole was pretty good and both of us really enjoyed our entrees.  However, the salad failed to come and our waiter only noticed it once he brought over the entrees.  We still got the salad but it was pretty bland and unexciting, despite the enticing description on the menu.The worst part of the evening was the service.  Even though our food was good, we could never find the waiter to refill our water or order dessert.  He took so long we ended up deciding not to get dessert at all.  Even though the interior of the restaurant is cute, I would not go back.  Compared to other places in Chambana, the prices are high and I can also get really good food elsewhere.",

Usually we order wine or beer, but this time got our mixed drink on. She had a super strong sangria that was good once you had a couple of sips and I had a Capirinha (sp?), which tastes like a Mojito w/o the mint, but with tequilla instead of rum (I know its not tequilla, but that is what it tastes like). Anyway, that was really strong, too but was not as tasty as their spicy Bloody Maria that followed.Service was spotty for us. Our server probably should not have been assigned our table, as she was busy with a private party in a special room they have. She did not make it up to us in the al fresco dining section as much as I would have liked. However, she made up for it with a comp on the Bloody Maria, so its all good in this hood.The food was great. We had an app of their stuffed pupusas, a great vegetarian dish that is bready goodness just bursting with latin flavors. I had the enchiladas and she had the pork tenderloin. Both were fantastic and big enough for lunches the day after. Since we were on bikes, they were able to wrap the dishes up extra careful for my backpack, and they made the trip back to Urbana no worse for the wear.BTW- There was an obnoxious 40-something biatch next to us getting all nasty with her server about the (extremely moderate) amount of spice in the food. Its not too spicy. If you are think Escobar's is too spicy, then you will never know the joys you are depriving yourself.",

Escobar's is a gem. I consider it one of the finest restaurants in the area. Escobar is extremely knowledgable and creative in his presentations of Central American cuisine, and the prices are half of what you would expect to pay if you read the menu without the prices.I've eaten here dozens of times, both lunch and dinner. I've never had a bad experience with either the food or the service. House baked rolls or muffins, sometimes sweet, sometimes savory are delivered to your table first off. Then there are several specials of the day. The service has always been prompt and attentive, whether I have eaten alone or in a group of up to twenty people. The first time I had the roast chicken with mole, I was floored. It's very difficult to roast a chicken and have the light and dark meat be perfectly cooked. Escobar's does this, and the mole sauce is spectacular.For lunch I tend toward the sandwiches. The shrimp po' boy (which I order on Cuban bread) is excellent, with black bean corn relish and herb aioli. The Guatemalan Torta is a perfect blend of ingredients. I can't recommend this restaurant highly enough. Better hurry, though...Escobar's lease is up in January 2017, and he's decided to end the business unless he gets a sale offer. That's a pity.",

Service here can be spotty, but I have been happy with the food for what it is.  It is not really what I would call Nuevo Latino or Latino fusion, such as a Cuatro in the South Loop in Chicago.  It is more Americanized, with some influences of Latino cuisine.  That said, I have had good steak and pork here, and the tres leches (three milk) cake is excellent.  I suggest eating in the bar area.  Quieter, full service, there are tables there as well.",

'Twas wondrous.After a great time chatting with fellow graduate students, professors, and a prospective student, it came time for dessert.  And they had bananas flambe.  Now two of my favourite things in life are desserts and unnecessary applications of fire.  And this bananas flambe was absolutely marvelous.  I was filled with happiness.

This was near the top of their list of must-go's.The food was good, but not great, and certainly not amazing.  At our table, we had:- Hanger steak asada - Phyllo-wrapped lamb loin (got the best reviews, but they still weren't enthusiastic)- Sesame-crusted salmon- Sauted shrimp and scallopsThe service was fine, though we were kept waiting for our food for a LONG time.  Plus, all entres but one came out at the same time, and it took more than five minutes for the last to show up.  I hate when they do that... everyone who has their food wants to eat it but feels they need to wait, and the one person who doesn't have their food is left feeling guilty and telling everyone to start.  No thanks.Also worth noting:18% gratuity for parties of 5 or more, \"for our convenience. \" Really?  I've never seen this for under 6, and usually under 8.  This is so they're more sure to get a good-ish tip because they're planning on the party being difficult because of its size.  5 people is not difficult, suck it up.$4 Split plate charge.  Really?  This is not a hoity-toity enough place to pull this off, even in Champaign.  Thanks for putting it on the menu, though, instead of trying to sneak it in... at least you're broadcasting your shortcomings.-Overall, given the weird choices they make, the good-but-not-great food, balanced with the meal prices (most hovering in the $20 entre range), it's solidly a two-star experience.  I wouldn't return.",

Although the dipping sauce sounds hot, it wasn't. It was more of a citrus and jalapeo flavor and it complimented the coconut shrimp quite nicely.  We tried the hanger steak fajitas for our entree.  It's a good thing we were able to split the entree as it would have been way too much for one person.  The steak had a wonderful mole sauce with a little kick. And the vegetables were not typical for fajitas.  Asparagus, carrots, onions, red & green peppers.  Also had a side of black beans and rice with black beans.  The regular margarita was one of the best I have had in a restaurant.  The menu is seasonal and changes quarterly, so you may or may not be able try something that is suggested in the reviews.  Timing is everything! I would definitely go back when I'm visiting Champaign.",

The calamari wasn't the traditional type you'd get at mainstream American restaurants but it was thicker pieces of squid with panko breading. This non-traditional set-up was quite good although the sauce that came with it could be a little bit more tangy. The Moroccan beef soup was very good, beefy but not overbearing. For the entrees, I ordered the Phyllo wrapped lamb and she the duck roast. The lamb was excellent, it came wrapped in a flaky Phyllo pastry and a succulent sauce. The sides were also superb, although I could use a little less garlic in the mashed potatoes. The duck was cooked to perfection, although the plantains and mashed sweet potatoes were left a lot to be desired.We shared dessert, which was the banana flambeed with vanilla bean ice cream. It was amazing, although it is quite hard to mess up something so innately satisfying. Overall, the presentation was superb and the waitress courteous. The atmosphere was fine for the occasion, although my girlfriend did complain about the \"orangy\" walls... haha. In any case, I highly recommend Escobar's for a good meal.",

I was in the mood for Latin-type food and found Escobar's. The boyfriend and I left work around five and arrived at the restaurant around 5:30. I was expecting to be one of the first tables being that it was early. When we arrived there were already 5 or 6 tables seated, I took that as a good sign. We were promptly greeted and shown to a table. We were brought water and bread (delicious, by the way) and within a minute our waiter was at the table greeting us. As we looked over the menu our waiter described the special of the day and gave information on the many delicious sounding menu options. My boyfriend loves calamari so that was a no-brainer for the appetizer. He is pescatarian but the wild mushroom enchilada struck his fancy. His review: The enchiladas were delicious. Most places give you three smaller ones, here you get one large enchilada with a generous amount of filling. The sauce that covers the enchilada has a nice (not overpowering) bite to it. My food: AMAZING. I had the seafood paella, half a lobster, shrimp, and mussels. The lobster and shrimp were perfectly cooked and seasoned well. Some of the mussels were a tad overcooked but based on the rest of the meal I was willing to overlook this tiny misstep. The waiter was well on his game, eyeing our water glasses from across the room and bringing more before we even emptied the glass. We will definitely be coming back!",

                "review": "Escobar's might be the best restaurant in Champaign. The atmosphere is cozy and comfortable. The wait staff has always been pleasant and attentive. And the food is almost always impressive. I'll acknowledge other reviewers who gripe about the time it can take to receive your food. Going to a fine restaurant should be an event, not something you rush through. It's an experience. I've never found a meal here to take longer than similar fine restaurants. A typical meal at Escobar's might last roughly 70 - 90 minutes if you get an appetizer, entree and dessert. Not unreasonable at all, but maybe a little longer than a meal at Chili's, for instance. ;-)As for the food, you'll be served a small basket of assorted breads once seated. These are always fresh, delicious and unique. Some sweet, some savory. I never know what kinds we'll get, and I always get a little bit excited to see what will be in there. Please excuse my nerdiness. Below is a rundown of some of the dishes I've had at Escobar's. Appetizers: Coconut crusted shrimp - fantastic. The shrimp are enormous and perfectly fried. Served with a delicious orange-jalapeno dipping sauce.Duck confit taquitos - a taste sensation, but at $10 for just 2 taquitos, it's a bit of a splurge. Almost an amuse-bouche than a true appetizer. If there were 4 in an order, getting this would be a no-brainer every time. House made guacamole - a huge portion of freshly-made guacamole, served with a heaping pile of warm, roasted tortilla chips. This is a favorite when I come here. Entrees:Filet mignon and andouille sausage kebobs - my new favorite dish. I have never had such tender, melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon in my life. The andouille sausage was a nice, spicy accompaniment. Huge portion. Absolutely delicious. Phyllo wrapped lamb loin - a bit overrated. The phyllo was a little burnt when I ordered this, and there wasn't much of a sauce. Crab cakes with guajillo cream sauce - O.M.G. The crab cakes are light, flaky, fresh, and this guajillo cream sauce - a bright orange sauce, takes this dish to a whole new level. Spicy, smokey - it's a heaping forkful of warm love going in your mouth every few seconds. Love. Sauteed shrimp and scallops - a forgettable, bland dish - and the scallops were gritty (my worst nightmare whenever eating scallops). One of the few disappointments I had when dining here. They do have a small dessert menu. Mango rum cheesecake, lemon curd pie with berries, flan (I never knew I liked flan until I tried it here!). Dessert portions aren't too big, nor too small. The perfect way to end a fantastic meal. Again, service has always been friendly and attentive. Once, we were not waited on for about 10 minutes after being seated. When our waitress realized her mistake, she offered us free soup to make up for it, and gave us excellent service during the rest of our meal. She went out of her way to make it up to us, and we appreciated her enthusiasm. One of my favorite restaurants in the C-U area!",

Last time I went with my lady friend on Saturday before Valentines Day.  Made a reservation which they screwed up and stuck us in a corner four-top while several other more cozy two person tables sat vacant during our whole meal.  Menu was special for valentines day and had several options.  I chose tilapia and my girlfriend got the filet.  Being a wine couple but not familiar with many wines from outside the U.S. I asked for a rec from the server who admitted to having no idea on wine pairing and left to go ask someone.  Even at biaggis their servers are trained in that.  Very disappointing at a higher dollar establishment.  Remainder of meal not impressive.  Tilapia was average and would agree with some of the other posts in that it was too much food and not enough contrast in flavors.  I forgot to mention the coconut shrimp app we got that was also disappointing.  No coconut flavor at all.  Too full for dessert.  Filet that I tried nothing special either.  For my money- Radio Maria, Milos when it was in Lincoln Square(haven't tried new location), even Jim Goulds.  Just so much better service, ambience, and food selection and quality to come back here again.",

Spoiled me forever on a taste that... you just couldn't get _anywhere_.  As a matter of fact, my next trip to Miami, I actually hunted down as many Cuban sandwiches as I could find.  Sure, there were some more authentic, and sure, there were some a little cheaper (you know the nature of street food), but Escobar's did the thing proud, man!Now, I can say that I've not always had the best service in this place, especially when it comes to getting served.  I also found things a little dingy!  The place could use a facelift (or two). =))All-together, though, a nice place to enjoy a little cultural infusion and ham! =D",

It was pretty empty in there, but it was sort of after the lunch rush and it was during the week.  We promptly were served ice cold water and some delicious banana bread muffins with butter for free.  I ordered a freshly squeezed limeade, a nice twist on lemonade.  My friend and I both agreed on getting the Cuban sandwich.  So many different flavors playing into this sandwich.  Sliced ham, a deliciously marinated shredded pork, Monterey-Jack cheese, pickles and a whole seed mustard topped off the sandwich served on baguette bread.  My friend commented on how he doesn't usually enjoy mustard but really enjoyed it on this sandwich.  The sandwich was accompanied by a side of mixed greens in a vinaigrette and some sweet potato fries.  Sweet potato fries are always an A+ in my book and the mixed greens were a good add too.  The fries and salad weren't anything to get super excited about, but definitely yummy and helped fill me up for sure.  Left there with a whole other half of my sandwich and one of the muffins. Lunch is extremely reasonably priced and although I understand it to be a little more expensive for dinner, I can't imagine being disappointed from what I saw from this meal.",

I was down visiting my daughter and she chose a winner!Escobar's has a very inventive menu with a fusion of many latin tastes with its own Ol added to the mixture.  We had the fried calamari for our app, something I would not expect in a Latin restaurant but it was delicious with one heck of a tasty sauce.  I had the Cuban sandwich for my main course and it was crunchy with all the distinct flavors you expect in a Cuban sandwich but with their own version of it.My favorite two beverages in the world are freshly brewed iced tea and bottled Mexican coke and they had both.  Hard choices that are great either way are part of what makes this such a great place.It's more expensive than your typical Mexican restaurant because it is so much more and quite frankly, aren't you worth it?",

We ordered a super burrito and chicken fajitas.  The food was edible, however, neither item came with sour cream, guacamole or anything of the sorts.  The super burrito did not come with any sides.  The fajitas did not come out sizzling and looked as if it had just been microwaved.  We ordered flour tortillas, however, received corn (which looked old).  Had to ask another server for the correct tortillas, which took awhile to receive.  The atmosphere was completely chaotic...There was no sense of professionalism nor order to the restaurant.  The back wall was not even painted and was just bare drywall.  I would not recommend... go to El Toro.",

Bummed about the name change, but much of the food and staff is the same, and the new owner is quite visible and interested in hearing from his guests. I am absolutely addicted to the heaping bowls of delicious, hot, freshly-made-on-site tortilla chips that they deliver to your table as soon as you sit down. And the homemade salsa is amazing. Easily best chips & salsa in town, particularly compared to Dos & El Toro. And the food overall is excellent. We've never had a bad meal there. The green sauce that they make from scratch is amazing, and I pour it over everything on my plate. I finish every meal by pouring the salsa over the remaining beans and rice and shoveling it all down. Awesome. Great drink specials and atmosphere. It's not quite Mas, but Don Juan still holds my affection.",

The details...I arrived with a small group at the beginning of the lunch hour, and our party were some of the first seated. We ordered quickly (with the drinks). We were then served cold greasy chips (one basket for 5 people). Our drinks came about 15 minutes later (water and soda), and then the wait for the food began. We watched every table around us be seated and served before our food came out. Then, about 45 minutes into our time there, *one* person's food came out. Attempts to flag down someone and get info at this point were unsuccessful. Eventually someone from our group got up to find someone.Finally, about 1:00 to 1:15 into our time there, 3 more meals arrived. Every plate was full of cold food. It was clear the plates had been sitting somewhere else for quite a while. This left one person still without food. More inquiries finally led to someone seeming to care and they said they'd get that food asap. When they served the final plate, which at least was hot, they said they'd comp that meal. This left the rest of us paying for our cold late food.I don't know what's going on there but clearly they don't know how to run a restaurant or how to prioritize action. Our meals were not complicated (tacos and burritos). Perhaps if the food had been fresh and not cold it would have been good; no way to know. I won't return.",

So instead of Jameson or Crown, I had to settle for Jack and Coke. The first time they made it correctly and everything was fine. The second time I ordered it (I didn't watch them make it) I got a liquor that was clearly NOT Jack Daniels. The place was pretty busy so I assumed it was an honest mistake. I gave that drink to a friend and went back to order another, and watched them this time. This is what happened:Ordered my drink and girl turns around and says \"Jack and Coke\" loudly enough for the 2 other people to hear.Guy handling the tabs says \"That's $5.50\" and charges it to my card.Then the other guy makes the drink and proceeds to use a liquor from the well...I had to actually shout across the bar that I ordered a Jack and Coke to have him put Jack in my drink.The tab guy and the drink guy shared an \"oh sh*t\" look with one another.They then let me see my tab when I closed it and it had a rum and coke on there in place of one of the Jack and Cokes as though to make up for it.Had it not been busy I would have seriously called them out on this issue. They charged me for a Jack and Coke the second time even though I got something that wasn't one. The difference is only a couple of dollars but the fact that they were trying to save nickels and dimes by giving me crap liquor instead of what I ordered is ridiculous. I have been to a great many bars in my time, especially while I was in the military, and I have NEVER had someone swindle me out of what I ordered in this way.Due to the fact that the guy made my drink correctly the first time, and shared that glance with the tab guy when I busted him is strong evidence that it was not an honest mistake. I will not spend my money in this establishment again and I can only hope those that own this establishment will see this review.",

When you walk in, there is someone who takes your order (the person who took our order didn't even know the menu very well). The menu is on a board (like most fast food places) instead of having hard copies. Their menu selection has been cut in half and everything seems more expensive. The burrito, casadilla, chimichanga and something else is $5.95 but make you pay extra for any sides ($2 for rice or beans and $1 for chips and salsa). The Chimichange just had beans and steak in it too, not worth the price! I had the enchilada meal. It came with 3 enchiladas, rice beans and chips. It was not bad, just came out a little cold.  We had to wait 30 minutes to even get our food. The food quality also seems to have gone down. The queso tasted very cheap along with everything else. Sadly, at the table we were at there were ants crawling all over the place. How digusting!! I loved Don Juan before and now it is so disappointed. Overheard a lot of other people say that they would not be coming back either.If I was rating the food alone I may give it a 3 stars but with the service and prices.... I will not be returning!",

                "review": "Mexican food on a Saturday night!We ordered delivery through the eat-cu service because they had a couple of coupons available for Don Juan.The ordering website was a little tricky to work especially trying to apply the coupons but after we got all that figured out it was fairly easy and our food was delivered in a very speedy ~45 minutes.I got steak fajitas with rice and black beans while my roommate opted for a steak burrito with rice and refried beans. They also included some chips and salsa with our order too!The chips looked pretty good but they were a little greasy and kind of flakey in consistency. Probably would have been much better if they were warm but its hard to expect that from delivery. The salsa was not very good, kind of watery and generally lacking.We were able to choose 2 sides with our orders and we both chose rice and black/refried beans, respectively. Since I got the fajitas though, one of the side options was tortilla shells. This was kind of weird because if I actually wanted to make fajitas I'd have to give up one of my other side selections just to get the shells. But this didn't really bother me because I would have rather had 2 sides and no tortillas anyway. Just a heads up though to all you fajita connoisseurs! The steak meat itself wasn't bad, it mixed well with the peppers and onions but still wasn't anything to really write home about. We both agreed the rice was very bland. My favorite part of the meal had to be the black beans; they were thick, kind of creamy and delicious!Overall, it was average. I can't complain about the price because we did get a fairly good deal with the coupon even including tip and delivery fee. Without the coupon though, I'd say it's probably overpriced. Still a much better experience than the food I got from Torticas/Burrito King a couple months ago, that stuff was really awful!Perhaps I should try something else or maybe eat in the restaurant next time.",

I ate this while under the influence of alcohol and am this strongly opinionated on how bad it was. Imagine if this was eaten while sober? I would suggest eating the gravel off the side of the street before entering this place. I'm going to stop typing now because thinking about this atrocious burrito is making me nauseous.",

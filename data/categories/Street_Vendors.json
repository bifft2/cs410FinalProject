During my first trip, I had a chorizo taco Mexico style (cilantro & onions) and a chorizo quesadilla.  Holy chorizo, Batman!  It was so good and such a huge serving.  The taco was ah-freakin-mazing.  I love that you can order Mexico style with cilantro and onion or American style with lettuce and tomatoes.  The quesadillas are overstuffed and toasted perfectly.  One quesadilla could definitely feed two, especially if you throw 1 or 2 tacos in the mix.  I've also tried the steak taco, American style and the chicken quesadilla.  The food is so fresh tasting and the meat tastes like real, high quality product. Another huge perk... The workers!  They are so friendly.  During our first visit, we were given some homemade pickled jalapenos to try.  They were amazing.  They aren't on the menu, so I'm not sure what to ask for next time I want them!  You have to try this place!  It's cash only and they will wrap your food to go if you prefer to not eat at the picnic table.",

There is an easy menu of flavorful basics: tacos, flour or corn, American and Mexican, tortas, burritos, and guacamole. Everything runs from $2 (tacos) to $8 for a massive burrito. But the star of this place is the elote.  Being from Chicago, elotes are a part of summertime. It's easy to make: cheese, corn on the cob, and chil but the flavors have to be just right to be authentic. And luckily for us poor central Illinoisians, Motorizado figured it out. For $2.50 you can enjoy this wonderful treat. They do go fast but if you come by at lunch, they usually have it. The service is quick. Just grab two sauces and a Jarritto from the shop next door and you're living the life. Heads up that there is no place to sit except one picnic table that might snap if you sit too long. It's definitely a part of the charm,  lol.",

My favorite are the steak and chicken tacos with a side of guacamole & chips.For Maize fans:This spot has better sauces, and is more affordable. If you want the maize taste just ask them to add cheese. You end up eating just as good if not better for a reasonable price.",

Taco Motorizado did not disappoint.Fair warning before you go: Cash only, no seating available.A tweet from Champaign Taste sent me in this direction and I had a steak torta. It was loaded with steak, veggies, and cheese. It was messy and fantastic. Easily the best torta I've had. The steak was in small bits and was great; some Mexican restaurants have chewy steak in their food, this was the opposite.I'm nervous putting this review up in fear the lines will stretch from the parking lot to the intersection of Prospect and Bradley, but I really want this place to stay open.See CT's review here ... http://champaign-taste.blogspot.com/",

It can get very crowded and loud especially on the weekends, but if you can manage to grab a booth/table it's a pretty fun place to be.",

There was nothing wrong with the dishes per se, but there was definitely not anything remarkable. For the portions they were definitely not worth the price. The flavors tended to be fairly bland, and I was really not impressed. The presentation was well done, however. On another note, the martinis were great, and reasonably priced. I got a dirty martini, and substituted Stolichnaya for the Svedka, and it turned out really well. The waiter forgot to specify the vodka change on the second round, and while service was slow, the food came fast once the order was in. The experience was not unpleasant, but I doubt I'll be back. There are better places elsewhere in downtown Champaign.",

Met up a couple of friends here for a drink and ehh it was alright. My mojito was too sour and the leaves are grinded up pretty good so you can sip up a herb and not even know it. I sipped an herb and chewed on it by accident and YACKCKK!! My friend's martini was too strong for her so she asked to have it re-mixed, the waiter said he was too busy but questioned her for 3 minutes about her drink saying he couldn't do it, and wadda-ya-know, he did it! He was friendly overall, however, but saying one thing and then the truth comes out is a slight pet-peeve for me.Environment was nice; music really cranked up at 10 on the dot. Good place to chill and have a few drinks, what i really liked were the prices. They were very moderate and not overpriced. I would come back again but next time i'll pre-drink so I can babysit another mojito that i don't enjoy. :).P.S. I received a follow up message; this goes to show that this restaurant really shows effort to tend to the comforts of the customers. Great service!",

                "review": "My idyllic memories of Boltini are almost assuredly the product of imperfect memory and undiscerning taste, reader beware.  But even the particulars I can recall still sound objectively wonderful.  Metal baby feet for door handles, internally-lit glass panes that trap splays of branches and project Tim Burtonesque shadows on the walls above the intimate circular booths and swank cushions in the recessed lounge, Bells on tap, a full array of top shelf liquors (not normally a special attraction, but it's in Central Illinois after all), and a martini list I used to adore.  This is really where the lovely memory gets shaky:  I was horribly fond of the \"Hollywood\": Absolute Mandarin, Chambord, and orange juice, which now just sounds heinously sweet and I seem to remember them costing far more than I ever wanted to pay for a drink in Champaign.  It makes me wonder if perhaps I would be disappointed were I to return, but I suspect that Boltini is still the only bar in Champaign that manages to be sort of hip, almost pulls off posh, even seems legitimately urbane.  And once in a while, in a college town, that's absolutely worth the slightly higher prices.   Light appetizers are available until 10pm, and the menu aspires to a cheese-plate and pesto bruschetta sort of class, but I never got there early enough to judge the execution.  Oh, and don't miss the doll's head in the banister....and it suddenly occurs to me that maybe I'm just squicky about the dismembered infant parts.  Regardless, four stars.",

Started by sharing a huge bowl of Roasted Red Pepper & Smoked Gouda soup. Towards the bottom of the bowl, it started to get spicy. The spice was nicely counterbalanced by bits of bacon.Next, we shared a generous cheese plate with baguettes and fresh fruits. We chose three cheeses that would not be incorporated into other portions of our meal. Porter Cheese, Goat Cheese, and Bacon-Encrusted Brie. The Brie was excellent. It might be related to my obsession with bacon. I will tell you that somehow I passed on ordering their 12 perfectly cooked pieces of bacon appetizer.Finally, we ordered three small plates. Mushroom crostinis, crab cakes and bacon-wrapped blue affine stuffed dates. Crab cakes had a tropical feel because of a light slaw with fruit incorporated. The dates were delicious but heavy and rich. The portion included six dates. That would be great for six people as one was enough.Great night with great service. However, we got the feeling that we needed to initially command the attention of a server. The restaurant's tables are first come first serve and that chaotic feeling carried over into getting a server's attention that we were at the restaurant to eat and not just drink. If you aren't assertive, you may find it hard to get a table and to get service.",

My two favorites were the artichoke dip and the ahi tuna wonton (but again, I like everything with ahi tuna). The sandwiches were also really good too. We also got all their desserts (they had like 3 to choose from), and I loved the creme brulees. Best of all, the price was surprisingly cheap!The drinks were mostly good. Their beer of the month was good and cheap at $3. Other than that, their drinks fall in the $6-9 range which is a little steep for a town like Champaign. However, they make their drinks really strong, so you kinda have to pace yourself through the drinks.Overall, I like this place a lot. Great ambient, great food, great drinks, reasonable price. It's quite a rarity in Champaign.4 stars if you want to go there for drinks5 stars if you want to go there for dinner (because it's a bargain for the quality of food you get, especially when you have a gift certificate from restaurant.com).",

So yes, Boltini is known for their martinis, but they have quite an awesome (and oft overlooked) beer list.  I got a Shipyard Pumpkin Ale - that stuff's hard to find in Chicago, so points to the C-U mini-metropolis on that one!For dinner, we went with the crab cake appetizer (as a Child of the Chesapeake, I am honor-bound to try any crab dish heralded as \"best in town\").  I must say, this appetizer held its own.  While these were not traditional Chesapeake cakes, they took on a sort of Asian flair with the sauce and the vegetable pairings (I had no idea what to expect when I read that this came with \"Asian Slaw\".  What is that?  Eh, I'm still not sure, but it was delicious).  We definitely cleaned the plate.For my entree, I ordered the Blue Crab salad.  It was basically the appetizer salad-ified.  Without my asking, the dressing was on the side (gold star!).Overall, everything was fresh, tasty, and a touch unexpected (you never know when it comes to \"bar food\").  While their drink menu far surpasses their dinner menu, Boltini is still a decent spot to grab a bite downtown.",

                "review": "In the middle of February when the snow decides to attack us, my friend decides to go to Boltini for a birthday dinner.  I didn't even know this place had a dinner menu since all their drinks have the spotlight, but it's not too bad, depending on what you get.  For a cold night like this, a selection from their 'hot drinks' looks perfect to warm you up, and someone ordered a 'Peppermint Patty.'  A bunch of others got their $4 specials of Razzmo's and Clementine Cosmo's.  I just stuck with water.But back the the food.  It is cheaper than most of their drinks!  Pastas started at $6.50 and sandwiches were up to $10.  The Liar's Club Sandwich caught my eye because of the raw ahi tuna, avacado, and sriracha aioli sauce.  Everything was tucked inside of a soft sun-dried tomato bun cushioned with a bed of sprouts.  They could have spiced the tuna a bit more, and added some more sriracha.  I was searching for more flavor with each bite and before I knew it the sandwich was gone.It was easy to eat because the softness of the sandwich, but needed a stronger punch ... and maybe some crunch.  My friend had to add hot pepper flakes to everything.  I'd say get the pizza or pesto pasta if you want something that is guaranteed to be good.  Their ahi tuna tacos and \"grown up grilled cheese\" looked interesting.  They have something called the 'Brownie Tower' which is self-explained heaven and served with a shot of chocolate milk.The ambiance is alright, they have cool names for everything and an endless list of classy drinks.  However it's funny I felt like the menu was trying to assure me that eating here made me \"grown up.\" Hence the \"grown up\" grilled cheese or a \"grown up\" shot of chocolate milk.  It's a creative twist to kiddish foods but thanks for the reminder.  A word of advice, order the things that are listed the most on the menu.  The 10 pages of drinks and 5 pages of cheese were no accident.",

It was mentioned to us by the beautiful bride to be to try this place. Wonderful high ceilings, comfy curled couches, interesting bar seats, cute bar staff, (well... okay the girls behind the bar), and a very mixed crowd. But what were we here for? Well, myself and the rest of the crowd wanted a beer, my friend wanted some girls he could hit on. I won. Were there girls he could hit on here? Yes, so don't get me wrong on that account, but not the skanky girls he was interested in. We sat at the bar, I poured over their menu, rather impressive. About 8 to 10 different dirty martinis as well as a multitude of drinks and wines. Plenty of imported and micro brews abound,  Food looked pretty good as well, but my stomach was full from munching earlier, but on the other hand if it wasn't, I would have chowed down. I do have to say the staff behind the bar was hustling their butts off, so I allow the waiting a bit to get some attention to slide. Yet, I didn't understand why the bartenders were also serving tables as well, perhaps some one called in sick. Yet, they were still friendly and even made sure my friend's martini was just right when he said it was too dirty for him.  Even a DJ was spinning some tracks. I do have a weird feeling that this place is trying to do too much, perhaps with the competition of bars in the area they are trying to serve an everything under the sun atmosphere in a more upscale college town. I really liked it and if I ever find myself in town again, I want to stop by here. However I need to find a driver for this town to whisk me away back to my hotel. Finding a cab is harder than finding a Michigan Wolverine fan here.",

I was told it had 'an extensive martini menu,' so of course I had to go!The vibe here was interesting. You could tell it was one of the posher places in town, but it felt like one part dive bar and one part lounge. I must admit I liked the music. They were playing Jamie Cullum as I entered the place.I tried the Pomegranate Martini. It was okay. It was pretty sweet for a martini... but I felt pretty buzzed afterwards. So I'm sure it had a decent amount of alcohol in it.The bathroom was quite nice, though. I would go back and try the food next time. It had several things I would have wanted to try had I not eaten earlier.",

                "review": "A group of us have been coming to Champaign for our work to do some concentrated training 1-2x/month so we wanted to start checking out the local, non-college scene. We checked out Boltini twice, each time deciding on Wed. since it's their half-price-drink night.The first try was a few weeks ago and relatively early in the night I guess (9pm). We all, especially me, really liked the place itself; a loungey, chill vibe. I'm not a beer guy so I was very pleased with their great drink selections AND all 1/2 price! I thought this was a sure winner. It was kinda slow, and the main reason we left that time after only one drink was that the demographics threw us off. After some shifting during the 20mins. or so, there ended up being 5 couples there: all same-sex, 4 of the 5 were guys. Being new to the area, we didn't know if we found ourselves in a gay bar. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that, but it's just not conducive to keeping single straight guys around.This past week we came back because I was assured that it was a place open to all, so I talked the others into trying it again. On this, our second attempt (and third; we ended up coming back later), we got there around 10pm. It was later than the last time so I expected a bit more of a crowd. I guess that's my only complaint about this place. We gave it more of a chance, sticking around for just under an hour. It was worthwhile, but just not getting as active as we hoped. It did seem to start to shift as we were heading out, but he others had decided to move on.We ended up back there an hour later. The scene was about the same as when we were leaving; still just on the brink of happenin'. We stayed for about 45min, and I easily could have spent the rest of the night there but the others wanted to go back to the clubby place we closed at on our previous night.When we go back next week I think I WILL be sticking around if the vibe is right letting the others move on. I really want to love this place cuz it has all the right attributes for me (almost). Here's to hoping my next review will be 5 stars!",

I had the strawberry gimlet, which was a homemade mixture of strawberry puree and vodka, topped off with a healthy pour of chambord ($7.25). I don't usually like paying this much for a cocktail but you really do get what you pay for! The drink did not taste of sugar or artificial strawberries... it tasted fresh and was absolutely fantastic! Also, the drinks are strong. They really aren't messing around. All of the employees were nice and accommodating too! I might not bring the boy for a quiet night out, but for me and my girls, boltini is a nice treat :)",

I expected to find it on their website, but it's not there.Our server was nice and prompt and had several recommendations for our group.Wasn't a fan of the layout.  It's just a long bar with a few booths.  Our booth faced the door to the kitchen, so the dark atmosphere was frequently punctured by the bright light of the kitchen.  That's a small drawback.If you're in this part of town, it's worth dropping in for a killer cocktail.",

We came with a huge group for a friend's birthday and even though all the round tables were taken, the manager sat us at a bar height table and provided us all with barstools to wait for an open table. The manager was AMAZING - so friendly. Even though the bar was completely packed, he still came to check on us throughout the night even after he found us a round table. My wine was delicious and well-priced and after trying a few of my friends specialty cocktails, I will definitely try a martini next time. Also, the decor and atmosphere is extremely stylish and chic. It's a nice little escape from the sometimes ho-hum Champaign-Urbana atmosphere. It would be amazing for a girls night out.",

Drinks are priced relatively high for Champaign-Urbana standards at around $7-10 a cocktail, but they are made strong and well so it's worth it in my opinion. Food there is alright - I'm trying hard to remember it but failing ... which means it must not have been that spectacular.Summary: Go to Boltini if you want to get away and relax in an intimate setting. Not if you wanna get wasted and start dancing on the tables. Go to Joe's or Murphy's for that.",

I love the variety of martinis here, which you don't see often at this level, and I especially love the dirty martinis (the Bloody Hot and Dirty).  Appetizers are fantastic to share, especially the pub pretzel fondue and \"Euro Crostini.\"  This all leads me to the only reason I knocked this place down to four stars: My girlfriend got the pub pretzel fondue for me as takeout one day, and the dip was just dumped into the cardboard container with the pretzel, where it inevitably began to seep through.  Why a place that is usually as top-notch as Boltini would just dump a sauce into a cardboard container, I don't know.",

My brother is newly 21, so why not go somewhere with an amazing looking drink menu as well as an amazing looking menu?We got there relatively early on a Saturday, roughly 645pm. There were only a few individuals when we got there. We started the night with drinks, continued the night with drinks, and ended the night with drinks. Oh, and maybe some food. We each had martinis to start and were fairly pleased. Then I stumbled upon this gem of a mojito - strawberry basil. There were no mint mojitos due to the seasonality of mint - I love when restaurants acknowledge this fact. However, strawberries are in season, and made the most delicious drink. Maybe this is why I had 3.Oh, yeah, there's food. Do yourself a favor and order a cheese plate. A lot of the cheeses are from local farms and DELICIOUS. I continued the cheese parade with the Mac and Cheese. Cheddar and strong blue cheese? YUM. By the time we left (about 9:45pm - we take our time!) this place was PACKED, and much louder.Maybe since I'm used to paying Chicago prices for drinks, I found this place to be very reasonable. My mojitos were $8. We spent $95 on drinks, $50 on food, and were stuffed and well \"hydrated\" and very pleased.  Very pleasant service, although as Boltini got busier, we saw our waitress less (she was also doubling as a bartender). I will be back, Boltini.",

Boltini is pretty much the bar you go to when you \"graduate\" from C Street so I'm always bound to run into someone I know.  Sitting outside isn't as amusing as it used to be when \"Three Dollar Margaret\" used to roam Neil Street hitting people up for money, but it's still fun to watch everyone thinking Downtown Champaign is Chicago....it's not.

Do not come here if you are looking to be ignored and having to hunt down staff/bartenders.I understand that Champaign is a small town with literally nothing to do but come on now! My boyfriend and I drove down to visit his son that attends UIUC. After having a horrible dinner we decided to stop at this place. The only reason we stopped here was because it looked cozy from the outside and it was right next to our hotel. Now I liked the decor and the people that were in there were just \"ok\". This is were this place screwed up and pissed me off !!!!!!!!1. We sat at the bar and it was a pretty slow night. WE WERE IGNORED BY THE RUDE A$$ BARTENDER!2. I had to catch an attitude to get his attention and after that he was still a d&#%!3. He SNATCHED my credit card out of my hand to open a tab - NO! DONT EVER SNATCH ANYTHING THATS MINE OUT OF MY HAND4. He was pissed because I requested Titos vodka in my Cosmopolitan - how do I know? He looked at me, rolled his eyes, threw cup the old vodka was in, looked at me again, said something bitchy under his breath, aggressively grabbed the Titos bottle and then charged me for drinking a Cosmopolitan that tasted like baby juice. 5.  HIS NAME IS VERY INSIGNIFICANT AND IRRELEVANT BUT HE WAS WORKING (Saturday, March 8th at 9:30 pm)I can't believe the nasty attitudes and horrible customer service I have received in this place. I wasn't asking to have my ass kissed; all I wanted was a drink and enjoy my time. What really surprised me was that another PAYING client wanted to order a drink and he had to literally get nasty with the staff and bartenders to get anyone's attention. I thought I was nasty and bitchy but clearly this is what they do at this bar. Every single person that was behind this bar on March 8th, needs to be severely disciplined. You work in the service industry and should never act towards your clients the way they've acted this night. I will never ever come back to this place and I will tell everyone!",

The servers are as good or better than any other bar in CU that comes to mind (and, for better or worse, I drink nearly everywhere).The place where Boltini really stands apart (for me) are their martinis and mixed drinks. If you order a dirty martini, for example, but specify that you want it only a little dirty they'll get it just right. Their Old Fashioned is quite a production. I forget what all Robb (mgr) put in it, but it was delightful. My absolute favorite mixed drink at Boltini is their Sugar Plum. It sounds pretty froofy, and it is indeed delightfully delish, but this straight arrow stands behind this very strong and very purple (tasting) beverage. I am not sure if the fact that I order mine without sugar on the rim of the glass makes my Sugar Plum swilling any less emasculating, but I do want that fact noted for the record.Lastly, Boltini's hosts 'Tuesday Night Trivia', starting every Tuesday night at 7pm. It is a lot of fun and all you have to do is come with a friend or two or 4 (I think 5 is the max, but it may be 6) and let them know your team name. At this trivia night, as opposed to Canopy Club's, which takes place at the exact same time, team names are punny, but not perverse. The host(s) pass out answer sheets for you to fill in and ask several rounds of questions over the PA. Dont be afraid to ask questions if you are curious. Competition is fun, and the whole thing lasts about 2-2.5 hours. Winners get prizes, including free drinks, appetizers, and even massages. The crowd is good: think professionals, teachers, librarians, grad students and profs. I don't go regularly anymore because it is just a 'lil too dear and also a 'lil to slow. Canopy Club's questions come faster. NTN trivia at BW3's is faster still.Park behind Boltini's in the lot.",

We sat down at one of the small tables and it was much smaller than we thought so I asked her if she had a bigger table...she pointed to her left and looked that way pretty much saying \"that way\"...okay fine...our entire service she seemed really standoffish and not willing to get into the service. We asked her questions about a certain dish, she just stared at us as though we should know what it was and said \"its just 6 pieces on there\"....Then everything came out nice that we ordered, except my friends tapas dish. It wasnt even hot at all. So he told the waitress that he no longer wanted it and if he could order something else (this is when the attitude sparked ALL the way up). She began to question him as to why he didnt like it, and what he didnt like about it and this and that. After he stated that it was cold (for the 10th time) she said we can reheat it in the oven but he cannot have anything else. I got the manager. (Come on now, Ive been to OLIVE GARDEN, and had better service...they are always willing to switch something out if its cold or you do not like it, even though the reason he didnt want it was because it came out cold and unappetizing)When I got the manager she was really nice to me at the bar, but before she could get back to our table, our waitress talked to her. Which resulted in the manager now having an attitude with us. Mind you, it was 5 of us so they can all attest to this and will NOT be returning either, and we have told all of our friends as well. Why the manager was arguing with us, I WILL NEVER KNOW. very long story short, good drinks, terrible service, and even worse management. Honestly, servers can act that way, hey you never know who is having a bad night,  but management SHOULD NEVER EVER act that way.",

The food's only okay (I liked the chicken quesadila but not a lot), but it's pretty cheap and, honestly, you don't come to Boltini for the food. You come for the cocktails. The martinis are great, and if you don't like vodka martinis, there are plenty of great drinks on the menu (personally, I get dirty martinis and Old Fashioned when I don't want to drink sugary stuff). The bar is gorgeous, and they almost always have some sort of music, whether it's a live DJ or a guy and a keyboard (okay, that's not always the best sort of thing). The specials are also fantastic; Wednesdays feature half-price cocktails, and Thursdays feature half price martinis. While I wish they'd tell me what qualifies as a \"martini,\" I'm not going to complain. $15 can get you three really good drinks and a very strong buzz.",

I have never been as insulted by a waiter in my life as I was last night, when our waiter threw our checks at us and then went to the trouble of getting cash out of the register to RETURN OUR TIP, also throwing it at us, even though we paid with credit card.  Not only was this guy completely out of line, when I began reciting this story to friends later in the night \"We almost got in a fight with our waiter...\" everyone I told it to knew which waiter I was talking about from previous experience.  I won't be going back to Boltini for a while, and it gets demoted to 2 stars.  That kind of treatment is unacceptable.I think Boltini is my favorite bar in CU since it is essentially the only one that does not pander to Illini sports and skeezy undergrad men trying to get 18 year old sorority girls drunk, but it's hard to get my friends to go there because they think this makes it \"pretentious\" and \"snobby,\" preferring to get barfed upon at Mike and Molly's or wherever.  Personally I do not think it is pretentious, and I tend to think that the staff are only snobby when the patrons are acting like they are at a kegger and not like normal human beings trying to enjoy a non-Keystone Beverage.  Notably, when I first visited Boltini on a grad school visit whileI was living in Boston, I was SHOCKED at how cheap the drinks were.  I did not expect such low prices from such a well-appointed bar.I would EXPECT Boltini to have the best cocktails of any place downtown but I think that award , bizzarely, goes instead to Guido's.  The other factor contributing to the four star rating is the terrible, omnipresent, cigar-doused in ammonia smell that is even detectable out on the patio.  Perhaps this will improve when Champaign becomes smoke-free.",

Imagine that students and faculty remember their snooty martini bars from back home.

Spinning music, low lighting, amazing martinis, fantastic cheese platters--yeah, Boltini is a good life choice. I've enjoyed all my boltini visits, and marveled at the joys of pretentiously sippin' strong drinks in triangular glasses while glancing all about me.  Nicely done, Boltini.",

It was really good and really strong!  One is all you need.  We also ordered the margherita pizza, artichoke dip & the fancy mac & cheese.  The pizza was good, the dip was fabulous and the mac & cheese was gross. I do not know why they called it fancy mac & cheese.  The noodles were too big and chewy and the cheese did not have any flavor.  It was bland and boring and sticky.  Nothing fancy about it all so that was misleading.The dip had some hotness to it and had good flavor and consistency.  None of the food came out hot.  The pizza cheese was luke warm at best so I think it was sitting in the kitchen waiting to be brought out for a while.Our waitress was really nice and very helpful with helping us select menu items.Would I go back?  Yes, I would go back and try something different and hopefully we could sit somewhere towards the front and the light of day.  This place is really dark.",

Think black leather semi-circle booths with high backs in the middle of the room. Towards the back of the room are black leather rectangular IKEA couches with glass tables and candlelight everywhere.The drinks are large, mixed well, strong, and tasty. Personally, I prefer a perfect (half dry, half sweet vermouth) gin martini, shaken.You CANNOT go wrong with the cheese plates here. Make sure to come at least in a group of four so you can order the 3 cheese plate. You choose from a cheese list and it is brought out with sliced baguettes (toasted and non-toasted), fruit (green apple slices, grapes), and olives. I would highly recommend the gueyere, euro cream, and the cheese infused with port wine. But seriously, pick and choose to your hearts content because the pairing of great cheese with great drinks will make you feel reallll sexy.I exposed my friends for the first time to Boltinis last weekend and they were highly impressed with the classy setting, quick servers, and amazing cheese and drinks. Even on a hectic Saturday night, we found a nice seating area in the back of the pit for all 8 of us.Boltini Lounge is a place that should stay hidden (thank God it's in dtown Champaign and not on campus) for its adventurous, sick-of-underage-teenybopper-gangsta-wannabes, discriminating clientele. I tell my friends that Boltini Lounge is where the people sick of the same scene at Joe's, Fubar, or even SoMa turn to.We will be there again tomorrow night for a birthday :)EDIT:Only downside is that they don't serve wine... So unfortunately you can't bring your own bottle of nice wine to enjoy here. But I guess you're supposed to be here for the martinis right?",

I had the lobster bisque, which was a special, and it was a nice price (I think $5 for a nicely sized bowl). The drinks will kick your ass... in a good way. Our waiter was SO FUN.

If you like laid back beer-bars like Esquire or Mike and Molly's, you'll be confronted with something entirely different at Boltini. If you're interested in paying a bit more for girly, froo-froo cocktails, food that looks like food only smaller, or an entirely different experience this is the place for you. My most memorable moment at Boltini: asking for a Blue Moon and being handed a bottle (it's on draft everywhere else), and nearly spitting it out when I was told it would cost $4.75! (UPDATE: Blue Moon's are $4.25, not $4.75). They also assigned a single waitress to a group of over 20. When the clearly over-worked waitress couldn't keep up with the groups demands for drinks, I went to bar, and was rudely told by the snobby bartender woman that she couldn't add my beer to my tab because I had started the tab with the waitress. Again, I feel this would be an easy request for any other downtown pub to fill; but Boltini staff are too good to add one number to another number. That being said, if you're interested in fancy cocktails and fancy food--and are willing to pay extra for it--you'll probably like this place. If you're not a cocktail drinker, then skip this place.UPDATE: Thanks to Robb for responding to my concerns. Like I said, it's not my taste, but many people seem to like it. I'd rather have a diverse downtown than have everything the same.",

However, very expensive for the amount that you get. Our guest really did enjoy having BBQ as an option though so it served its purpose well. I did look at their menu to see if there was anything that I would be interested in ordering in the future. My go to order for BBQ is a chicken sandwich. But Hickory River doesn't have that. They have a smoked turkey breast though. Don't know how that makes sense.",

I'm pretty sure there were no other ingredient. Mac & Cheese: disgusting. Probably from a vat purchased at GFS. Fried Okra: crumbly, bland mess. We tried this place because we were tired and hungry and it had a drive-thru and no wait. Black Dog is minutes away but didn't want to bother. That was a HUGE mistake. Lesson learned. If you want GOOD food, it comes with a price. Crappy fast food? Readily available. But it also comes at a price.I'd like to note the customer service was very polite and friendly. ***I have no knowledge as to whether or not there is actual MSG in their product and I make no claim that there is.",

It's actually our hidden little secret. SL isn't historically known for the BBQ, but I've had my fair share of wonderful smoked, barbecued, and grilled meats.   My wife (and 10 week old) left pleasantly surprised that we found a four-star BBQ place here and mentioned we'd be returning sometime in the near future. It was a Friday night after 7, so not super busy, but it had a good crowd of families and some couples' date nights.  Ambience/fell:  You stand in line cafeteria style, with relatively small menus along the wall to be ready for your order up at the upgraded cafeteria bar. As you order, they put a few quickly served items on your red tray and a couple plastic name tents on their for anything that'll be served in a few quick minutes after you sit. The line went pretty quick (about 15 people=7 minutes), giving us a time to look over the moderate-priced, moderately sized foods (it does give a single $ under the name). There are plenty of items in the $4-$7/8 range, but some impressive-looking ribs and other cuts of meat in 'plates' (+2 sides) for about $12-$15.  My meal:  I got the pulled pork sandwich. It was good. The pork wasn't seasoned to taste, but moderately juicy and absorbed the sauce well. I thought I'd take him up on the mix of spicy and not spicy BBQ sauce - the sandwich came smothered in it (messy, but just the right amount of sauce in my opinion) on a soft bun. The portion was plenty for my moderately hungry appetite, but I was definitely over it by the last few bites.   Sides:  I added sweet potato fries (we love SP fries, and the friendly regular in front of us said he doesn't get anything else) and were looking for another appetizing side. The 'server' or worker gentleman recommended the mashed potatoes since I said my wife wanted to stay away from spice - I guess the Ranch Beans \"have a little kick.\" Needless to say, you don't go to a BBQ place for the fries and mashed potatoes. SP fries were significantly overcooked and slightly burnt and the mashed potatoes were a step above KFC's - perhaps a bit like a cracker-barrel style with a scant amount of light brown gravy.  Wife's meal:  My wife ordered the pork nachos. And we actually really, really liked the nachos. When we return, that's definitely going to be a repeat. The chips taste homemade, crispy and flavorful and are smothered in pinto beans (with juices), a plentiful helping of pork, and this really yummy queso sauce (kind of tastes like the queso dip from Chili's). Everything was really well dispersed too, which doesn't always happen at places. If we were more shameless, we would've licked the plate clean.  Sorry for the long post, but hopefully it helps.",

I only take one star because of its location and I only eat the brisket, so I can't really vouch for anything else (though the husband likes everything else he's tried)  The mixed sauce was a little hotter than I was expecting, but I think that is just because I've got weird pregnancy hormones that make everything taste either hotter or less hot than they actually are.  That being said, their sauce rocks my socks and the brisket is so tender and yummy.  Not a \"classy\" place, with the paper towel rolls on the table and the silverware up by the register, but it's a BBQ joint.  It actually seems more appropriate that way :)",

Where's my mustard sauce? (Let the great debate begin!)Anyway, I got the pulled pork sandwich with mixed sauce (they have a mild red sauce and a spicy red sauce, and mixed is... the two together), a side of cole slaw, and a side of mac'n'cheese (all three ran about $8 together). The pork was tender and had a good flavor. The sauce was very smokey and on the spicy side..not bad but could easily overwhelm the pork. I also had a bite of my friend's brisket, which wasn't nearly as good as the pork (brisket just isn't Q where I come from). The mac'n'cheese was stouffer-ish, but the slaw was great! Pretty solid. Complaint: cobbler and cornbread should be served warm.I'll be back once I check out the other BBQ places in the area!",

I have Yelped over 200 places and this is by far the worst cash register employee I have ever encountered. I've seen people who were lazy and not very smart, but no one has been as condescending and impatient as the hag that is taking your order at this restaurant. If we literally took more than one second to tell her what we wanted, she would roll her eyes and talk down to us as if we were imbeciles or something. I definitely did not appreciate that. Also, I definitely think BBQ tastes better if you truly take your time with it rather than outright rushing it (Well, I suppose this is fast food BBQ after all). I will say that the mac n cheese was quite delectable. The cornbread was also delicious, but had severe diminishing returns on flavor.",

Frozen GFS corn, over salty oddly-flavored beans, flavorless mashed potatoes, and distinctly \"meh\" fries. The biggest disappointment was the mealy brick of cold corn bread.

The price was reasonable too, as their large beef brisket (which is 8 oz) was $9.50, coming with two sides of our choice. The ranch beans was awesomely cooked.If I could, I'd give them 4.5 stars, but 4 is too low for them. You ask why? Well, I was expecting it be a bit more elegant. For example there is no waiter service. You enter their store, get into the line to order, get your food (very quickly) on a tray and then will go to find a place to seat. Another reason I wanted to dropped a half star is that they didn't accept my DISCOVER card (Although I'm kind of used to it, but nevertheless a nuisance). Another thing is the pricing on their small beef brisket. They ask for $8.50 for the small one, and $9.50 for the bg one, thus they're totally urging you to eat more (Not that the meal is bad, but too much meat isn't good for your health anyway).Btw, the sandwich prices are very reasonable, with most of the sandwiches being a measly $3.99. I didn't try them, but they come in small burger buns (think MacDonald's $1 burgers size) but with meat extruding from the bun, like twice as big as the bun itself. I guess it is probably enough for a meal.   Another good item on the menu is \"meat from the pit\", which they sell by pounds. Basically if you want to bring them home, this is the best deal. If I'm not wrong, it was $9.25 for a pound of their awesome beef brisket (the same price goes for all other BBQs as well). I'll remember this deal for my next home party!All in all, a good place to eat. I'll put it in my regular eating place list from now on.",

The coleslaw isn't quite what I expected, so if you're a fan of creamy coleslaw, skip it.  Atmosphere is VERY Texas, which leads to the Sooner fan in me resisting the urge to turn all the longhorn artwork upside-down.  (Guess now if it ever happens, you'll all know who to blame!).  Reasonably priced, and the service is outstanding.  Catering is top-notch, too; we had them cater our wedding rehearsal dinner, and every aspect of it was friendly, professional, and outstanding.",

Then you slide the tray to the cashier and select a drink.  You carry your own tray to a table you choose and they do the clean-up.Brisket is a specialty.  Sauce can be ordered hot, mild or mixed.  They also do a sliced turkey.  Meats can be bare on a plate or in a sandwich.Its very casual, TV sets constantly going, of course, because this is America.",

HR's is great for the area it is representing, if you took that brisket anywhere else in the country and put regional sauce on it you would come out on top.  I like all the sides, particularly the FRESH cole slaw, and I usually get chili and put some onions and sour cream on it.  Sweet tea is good, occasionally it is a little weak but always ok, maybe has something to do with how long it has been out.  I saw some people whining about plastic plates and cafeteria setting, or it was too country for them, where do you think you are?

My husband got the 3 meat, 2 sides platter.  He was sooo happy with his choices. sliced Beef Brisket,,(so tender!) sliced  Polish,, and a pile of sliced smoked ham.  The meat was pleantiful to say the least....he scarffed the whole platter down; smacking his lips after every bite.  I'm afraid I wasn't much different.  I got the smoked humongus baked potato with pulled pork and hot sauce and then proceeded to the potato topping bar for lots of butter, onions, shredded cheddar, halapeno's with a smidge of habenaro sauce on the side.  I have enough left over for lunch tomorrow and dinner tomorrow night and still share some with hubby. This place is the best.  The employees are friendly, helpful and have great attitudes.  Probably because they're looking forward to their next break so they can partake of some of these lipsmacking great smoked delicasies!W and S Tolono, IL",

The BBQ sauce is OK but nothing that spectacular.  The potato casserole was not that good.  It had a funky flavor I could not figure out.  The green beans on the other hand were good.  I ordered the pork loin and the pork itself was very good.The sweet tea was VERY weak.  As my grandfather would say \"the tea walked through on stilts\".  It has no flavor what so ever.I would not make a point of going here but if someone wanted to go I would not protest.",

The staff was friendly and the order was all correct. The pulled pork was to die for! Both the spicy and mild bbq sauces received great reviews from the party. Compared to Black Dog, Hickory is better for bigger groups and the wait time is way shorter. If you are craving bbq i would definitely recommend giving Hickory River a try.",

It is in the same price-range as Golden Harbor (which I love), but in my opinion the food here is even better.We were a party of 13, and were seated comfortably in the large table in the side room. The owner of the place took our orders, and she was wonderfully fun/sassy about it. She gave great recommendations, and would tell us if she thought we were making an unsuitable selection.Cuisine highlights:- GARLIC SAUCE, anything in garlic sauce was delicious (beef, eggplant, etc)- Beijing duck (wraps had good texture, duck was cooked well, good sauces)- Crispy tofu (crispier coating than from Golden Harbor)- Fish with pine nuts (fish was battered and fried, and drizzled with a sweet sauce)- Steamed tilapia (very tender)- Scallion pancakes (owner served us two orders for free)- Kung Pao Tofu (all-around delicious)I had been skeptical of the place because of its location in the eerily-deserted Lincoln Square mall, but they renovated the place a few months back, and the ambience is great!My only regret is, having gone away, I can't partake in this sumptuousness anymore :(",

The whole plate was filled with white rice, with very little veggies and chicken (perhaps 2-3 spoons). I just had to eat dry rice, which were also overcooked. It seemed the management is trying to save costs by cutting the portion size, while charging the same price. Next time I will pay more at a different restaurant, which does not try to compromise with quality and portion size. I was so unhappy with their service that I did not pay tip. But later I saw that they added $1.00 to what I had signed on the receipt.",

The duck was good though the \"pancakes\" were cold. The spinach was acceptable (and looked like a popular dish, considering how many other tables were ordering it). But the best thing hands down was the eggplant dish, which had the best sauce I think I have ever tasted. You will like eggplant after trying this dish! There was plenty of food for all of us, and we even took some home afterward; the vegetable dishes are large portions. Price was totally reasonable. Only real complaints are that the \"hot\" tea was barely warm, and that we had to flag down our waiter to bring the check, even though we'd been sitting over empty plates for quite a while.",

I ordered lunch online and got a call asking me to tip more and order more dishes, because it is a long way from the restaurant to my place in Savoy. Even after I explicitly told them I am fine with the amount of food I ordered (over $30), the guy still tried to ask me to order more and threatened not to deliver until I agreed to pay the so called additional delivery charge. All I want to say is that I understand it is a relatively long drive to savoy, but all other restaurants in town does delivery to Savoy with a lower charge and will never bother to call customer threatening them to order more.",

I was surprised about how kind he was. 5 minutes later the chef came to my table angrily and was YELLING at me in front of other customers \"are you lying ? I tasted the fish before it got served and it was not bitter.\" I was eating with 6 friends and it was just so sudden. I was so embarrassed and almost crying into tears. I was NOT lying and your fish is bitter! I'll never been this place ever ! The worst service I've ever had.",

Variety of Americanized Chinese food, including the all-mighty general cao's chicken, plus lunch special.3. Deserts and snack-sized dishes () are beyond comparable in CU area.4. The ONLY restaurant that opens late-night which serves authentic Chinese food rather than fast food.5. Services are above average.Cons:1. Above averagely pricy. Usually $2-$4 more expensive then similar dishes served elsewhere in CU.2. Delivery may be slow during busy hours (~40mins to ~1hour). 3. 15% tip is enforced on Chinese customers, due to their tendency to tip waiters inappropriately or not tipping at all. But if you look like a gentlemen/lady who appreciates the service of others then they won't enforce anything on you, liberty of tipping is all yours.In general, this is a great place to come if: you like real Chinese food or quality Americanized Chinese food, enjoys above average food and services, and willing to pay for the food and service. This is not a good place to come if: you would prefer to save up a little money and settle for okay food (Panda Express is always an option, right? lol), or your meal budget doesn't include tips like it is for most cheaper Chinese places.Hope this helps.",

With pizza I normally dislike thin crust very much but at this place I'll choose it over almost anything else ever had. The BBQ is awesome as well and when they have the jalapeo poppers they are also best ever had.Now the bad.. The place looks wise is run down and also very random.. Also a place with a bar that closes at 8pm even on weekends in a college town at that? Just makes you wonder what they are doing. Also while it has only ever happened once in about 25-30 visits I did once on a totally dead Sunday afternoon sit down for 20 mins before being talked to and my wife and I just left. But other then that one time the place was amazing every other so 4/5 definitely.",

As much as the hype surrounds it, I thought it was as good as it was gonna get. But I was wrong. Po'Boys isn't really too fancy in terms of appearance. It is quite plain but the interior is extremely clean and well kept. The staff are really nice and knowledgeable. I tried the BBQ platter and everything was delicious and tasted homemade - including the sauces - Amazing! The italian beef was nice and tender without being too watery as it often is when its not done properly but this one was perfect; the pulled pork was nice and flaky but still had that bite to it. And the best part was the polish sausage, nice and juicy, brimming with flavor. (The sausage was much better than Black Dog's by the way)....there were also three 'mini ribs', which were a bit firm but still delicious. And the best part? Almost half the price of any competition. If you're in the Urbana area, and need a quick, delicious, and good value meal, DO NOT MISS THIS PLACE!!!!",

I have been only once since they changed ownership.I hear that they have good food, mostly reminiscent of the apparently hallowed former Chambana institution of the same name. The word is the current owners bought recipes from the family that ran the old Po' Boys. Next time, I'll try the BBQ.When I went (in winter), I had beers and a fried cheesecake with jelly syrup and ice cream dessert in a martini glass. It was really good. Service was also good. Beer selection was pretty good, about a half-dozen of the usual suspects on tap with a better selection in bottles, although the prices were kinda high.The room on the right seems perfect to rent out for a medium to large size gathering. I have been a over the summer to watch folks play sports (when it was still the OTB), and it is pretty good for that. Decent prices on light beer in bottles.All in all, this place is merely average at best, with prices a little higher than I would expect. If you live out in the country and this is the closest place to you, I can see it being your go-to place, especially to watch sports. If you live in central Chambana, dont have a softball or volleyball game there, and are not a BBQophile, you have no reason to go to Po' Boys.",

I don't really need to go into a big long deal about how this spot is not like Arnie's spot in Downtown Champaign.  I will tell you that they have the original sauce, and the original Polish.  I love this combo.   The beef, the pork.. about a touch under being great.  One thing they have that I f n love, is Chicken, which the Original spot didn't have.  I just took stars off from Porgy's for the horrid way they have let their chicken go, but Po Boy's original sauce on that chicken.... It's heaven.",

The pulled pork pizza is out of this freakin world!!! If BBQ is more your style without the za' then you will be pleased to know that Po-Boys has 3 different BBQ sauces to choose from! The service is amazing and very attentive.... Oh and did I mention THE HOMEMADE PIE!Every time I stop in Urbana I always make sure to eat at at Po-Boys because its just that good!!!",

Very tender with just the right amount of crunch!  It was actually kind of miraculous that they hadn't run out, since I ordered them at 6:30 on a busy Friday night!  Fortune was smiling upon me, I guess.Our table also split the cornbread as an appetizer, which was just a little bit spicy (and meaty, of course).  Will other restaurants please jump on the savory cornbread train?  I am straight-up tired of eating over-sweetened cornbread that tastes more like cake.  Ugh.  My boyfriend and I split a beer flight, which is a fantastic deal: you are getting essentially 24 oz of beer for just $6.  And the little glasses all came out on a large wooden plate shaped like a dog bone!  Too adorable.The one not-so-good thing about our meal was the corn on the cob - it was mushy and flavorless and got stuck in our teeth!  I know this is a little early for corn season, but shit, we ARE in the middle of Illinois - you'd think they could get corn right!  Just stick with another side dish and you'll be fine.",

We had heard so many good things about it that we finally decided to give it a try. We were not disappointed.We were aware that the biggest drawback would be the wait for a table, so we left home early to get there right before it opened. Several other people had the same idea. We were given a nice greeting upon entering and were seated immediately. We were told that we might have a bit of a wait for service since we were seated before the place opened, but our waitress came by right away. We decided to start the meal with the appetizer we were most curious about: the burnt ends. Although a tad pricy, the meat lived up to everything we had read -- flavorful, wonderfully chewy around the edges, with melt-in-your mouth smoky goodness.For our lunch, we both had pulled pork sandwiches, sweet potato fries, and an additional side of twice baked potato casserole. The sandwiches were excellent -- wonderfull smokey meat, slaw, and excellent Carolina Red barbeque sauce. The sweet potato french fries actually tasted like sweet potatoes, but I am not sure why others have raved about them. They were just okay, as was the casserole. But ... we came to this place looking for excellent barbecue, and it delivered!We were happy we decided to eat right when the place opened because a line formed as we were eating our lunch. We decided to make a quick exit so that someone else could get our table. We were in and out in about 35 minutes.Would we come here again? Definitely! Next time I would like to try the Georgia Peach barbeque sauce and sample the chicken and catfish. I decided to only go with four stars because the sides were only average in our estimation. Next time we will try some others.",

Minus one star for always running out of food.  I know, it's typical of smokehouses, but still...  I always request to get the Georgia Peach bbq sauce, I could seriously drink that stuff.  No other smokehouse I've been to has ever had a sauce I find even remotely as delicious.  I also love the cornbread.  To drink, I get the jalapeno pineapple margarita, it's a very good combination of flavors.  I love that they serve the food on metal trays too.",

Today, 3 members of my group had to wait a whole 2 minutes because the other 2 people in the party hadn't arrived yet. Then, when we (the late arrivers, by 2 minutes) finally showed up, we were immediately given a booth. I thought this place was supposed to be good. So good that you had to wait for seating. Well, with the opening of the Champaign location, the Urbana location is now sort of a forgotten wasteland (I guess like the rest of Urbana). We were immediately informed that they were out of Burnt Ends. WHAT IS THE POINT OF LIVING?!?!? Did you know you can get a burnt ends burrito on Thursdays? WELL TODAY YOU COULDN'T!!  Had to settle for the regular delicious pulled pork burrito. As did 2 others in the group. Another ordered a burger (people, don't you know you are only supposed to order a burger when ALL the other menu items are 86'd) and another got a brisket sandwich. I ordered a mountain dew, while another person at the table started hitting on me. He called me Sweetie. Which apparently was a mistake on my part when I started rubbing his leg and he informed me that actually he had ordered \"sweet tea\". Oops. The food came out very quickly. I didn't even have time to complain about not having the time to eat my burnt ends appetizer which I didn't get to order. Oh, we got there at 11:30, they had been open for 30 minutes and didn't have burnt ends. I blame the guys that were sitting at the table closest to the bar! There were 4 of them and 3 of them smugly ate those delicious burnt ends as we sat there, envious, with only a pulled pork burrito to fill the void that was left by not having burnt ends. They had the chex mix today. Which is a first, because in all the other times I've been there, there was no chex mix. But today there was. I would sacrifice all the chex mix in the world for just one more chance at a burnt ends appetizer. The price was reasonable. My bill (which was presented on one of those new fangled tablet pc thingies) was 13. Which covered the burrito, a side of the potato salad, and the soda. I don't consider that excessive. The staff was (and always is) friendly. Except for that guy with a beard and a Mohawk, what kind of an idiot would have that kind of look. He wasn't there today. Why is troy a rocket scientist?",

The only entree I've ever had here has been the brisket sandwich, and it is phenomenal! If you show up early, try to order the \"burnt ends\" if they are available, those must be the best thing on the menu from what I've heard. The sweet potato fries are delicious, as are the smoked chicken wings!If you can't decide which sauce to have (my favorite is the Texas BBQ sauce, which has beef drippings and ancho peppers as the base. They should seriously consider bottling+ selling their sauces, because they are all amazing), you can order a \"flight of sauces\"-- a sampler of all their available homemade BBQ sauces for $3. This place almost always has a line and not the most abundant seating, so it's best to show up during \"off hours\". e.g. before 11:30 and after 1:30.",

Here's what I got:-combination platter with catfish, brisket, sweet potato fries, and double baked potatoes (for how much I paid I was expecting a larger portion; brisket was good; the catfish had an odd taste and odor - didn't really care for it; I had to pay extra for the sweet potato fries but it came with like 5 fries!! Grr. The twice baked potatoes were ok but suuuuuuper small cup of it)-burnt ends (DELISH)The food was a disappointment but the service was even worst! The server asked how the daiquiri was and my friend said it wasn't what she expected and he pounced on her interrogating her for why she didn't like it. IM SORRRY YOUR DRINKS AREN'T GOOD. You never attack the customer! So rude. He should've apologized and offered her another drink. Later he asked about the food and we mentioned the catfish and he had the same reaction! I was stunned.

He informed us that he had been overhearing our conversations at the table and was happy to report that they did have burnt ends and explained to one of my lunch mates what a mufelleta was and what it was made of today. This was a great touch - what an easy way to make a quick and easy impression on a table!So, I got my burnt ends sandwich, along with sweet potato fries - which I had been told were AMAZING. I also ordered their beans.We also ordered the cornbread... which was delish!!! I recommend it highly. It was moist, slightly spicy... and full of amazingness!The burnt end sandwich was increds. Cooked to perfection and flavored wonderfully with a Carolina Red sauce.The sweet potato fries weren't amazing - they were AH-MAY-ZING!!!!!The beans were delish as well - and did not need for me to add in any sauce or anything, which is my usual habit.I have to say... I have been coming to central Illinois for years and I am pissed it took until today for me to get to this place.I will be back... probably every trip to central Illinois!!!",

Next to a diploma from U of I, there is only one reason to pull into Chambana: Black Dog burnt ends.  I can't even begin to describe how incredible these slices of meat are, because tender, juicy, salty, prime, smokey, flavorful are just the tip of the iceberg.  This is the kind of BBQ that makes you swear out loud even if there are children sitting within earshot.  You simply cannot control yourself in between bites, nor do you feel ashamed of your mouth and fingers being covered in premier pieces of saucy, smoked meat.  Eating here is a bittersweet experience, for although your life changes for the better--knowing how BBQ should taste--you also grimace with the thought of how agonizing future meals will be, as they won't compare to a glistening platter of meat at Black Dog.  Still, don't let that stop you from the joy and meat sweats that the best BBQ in Central Illinois--or dare I say the Midwest--has to offer.",

You can't go wrong with any of the sides, but my favorite is the sweet potato fries. Nice beer selection, and if you want to feel like you're hanging out and eating BBQ in Austin, they have Shiner and Lone Star in bottles.Only catch...the place is so popular and so good (and so small) that wait times can be very long.

In my humble opinion, Black Dog is the crown jewel on the restaurant scene of the Champaign/Urbana area. I hope everyone in the area appreciates what a fantastic place they've got! I'm officially jealous. I have only been here twice. Last time I went, I fantasizes about Black Dog for almost a year before finally having the chance to come here again after my brother graduated from U of I. The specialty here is the BBQ, but I'm pleased to report that a vegetarian can eat perfectly fine here! Under the \"not sandwiches\" portion of the menu, there is a portobello mushroom option. It is godly. The almond pesto is seriously the stuff of dreams and the red peppers and goat cheese are he perfect complement. I am in love with the cornmeal crispy warm bun, too. I have TMJ and can therefore usually not bite into big buns, but this one is the absolute perfect size. My dining companions says they especially enjoy the cornbread (which has meat in it), but I'm all about the sweet potato fries for my one side (it comes with one). It's totally worth paying the extra $0.70! After writing this review, I now feel sad because no one else I'm close to is a student at UIUC anymore, so I don't have an excuse to drive 2.5 hours to get some Black Dog!",

The chicken sandwich I had was good, once the barbecue sauce was able to make its way down to the pulled chicken on the bottom of the bun. Otherwise, it was a bit dry. My boyfriend had the Carolina sandwich and he enjoyed that along with the potato salad as his side.A good selection of alcoholic beverages with not the largest selection of beers. The \"Ale House\" part of the name gave us the impression that maybe there were several selections on tap but, as I recall, there weren't a ton nor could we see the tap handles (outside of 1) to get a visual (sometimes that's nice to see). Of course there was a beer list, though. Overall, not a terrible experience but just a basic one. Nothing crazy.",

The twice baked potatoes were outstanding and sweet potato fries were also very tasty. We also had a side of the chicken wings. They were the very very best wings, perfectly done tender and just the right spice. With the sauces that come are not required on the meats. The sauces add a lot of extra flavor. I will definitely be back here in another month when I return.",

Every single item I've had was delicious. From burnt ends, to beef ribs, pork ribs, pastrami sandwiches, smoked duck, fried chicken, brisket, and a stupid number of late night home made sausages among other things, every single entree is a new and delicious adventure. The meat is smoked to perfection, the dry rubs are all world class, and you get your choice of BBQ sauce to suit your taste. The cornbread even has pulled pork baked into it. The sides are all good, but the best are definitely the sweet potato fries. I did not expect to find food this good in Urbana-Champaign, but here it is. This place is a real hidden gem.But this place doesn't stop at the food. The beer selection is great, with an awesome bottled selection (not huge, but it's quality), and a constantly changing set of beers on tap. Add to this their whiskey selection and cocktails (pineapple pepper tequila margarita...) , and this place is a fantastic bar on top of being a top-notch restaurant.Oh, and did I mention the price is beyond reasonable? 5/5 this place is worth a visit. Or two. Or twenty.",

It's nationally recognized for quality, and it shows in every aspect of their food. The barbecue is flavorful but never dry. The sauces are varied and incredibly tasty. Their sides are delicious. Their sweet tea is to die for. They have a great selection of craft beers. The only problem is the wait - they're such a popular destination that you'll frequently have to wait 15-20 minutes (or more) for a table at peak mealtimes, But with their new Champaign location starting to kick off, that might start to get better. If you're just passing through and only have time for one meal in Champaign-Urbana, do yourself a favor and make it Black Dog.",

There are a few different BBQ sauces that you can try. It is nice that the sauce is not on the meat but comes on the side to allow you to taste the meat itself. I've had their cow rib special once and that was delicious as well, but it is a lot of meat. Most of their sides are also very good. I've heard that if you don't want to wait in line, you could always order take-out which kind of eliminates the waiting part. I don't recommend going here with more than 4 people because it is a smaller restaurant.",

I usually order the pulled pork and the brisket, although I occasionally will get a hot link. For sides, the twice baked potatoes and pit beans are probably my favorites, with honorable mention going to the sweet potato fries.I also have tried the burritos (only served at lunch time) and they were excellent.I live in Chicago now (after living in Urbana for about 6.5 years), and I have been unable to find a BBQ place in Chicago that even comes close to Black Dog. This came as a huge surprise to me since I just assumed somewhere in Chicago there'd be something this good, but it has just been a series of disappointments. When I want BBQ, what I really want is Black Dog.I recently went down to visit Urbana, partially for an excuse to eat here. The beer selection at Black Dog is also phenomenal. I discovered several relatively obscure beers I had never heard that have since become regular favorites. (New Holland Dragons Milk being one of them). I think Black Dog has a more interesting beer selection than the Blind Pig some of the time.Be prepared to wait a while, but the wait is worth it. They might want to consider expanding to a larger location, one always worries about that since it might mess with success. I think they could probably sustain it though considering this is almost a regional draw.",

The ribs were pretty tender with a nice smokey char on the outside and the chicken was soft, mostly cuz it was dark meat but it also had a distinct smoked flavor that reminded me of lil porgies. They don't give you enough sauce to cover both of them, but they'll give you more if you just ask.The red cabbage coleslaw was a little too sour for me, but boy...the sweet potatoe fries are pretty awesome, I couldn't get enough of them!! Sweet, crunchy, potatoey...with a little bit of that sauce...ooo...i'm drooling right now and it's morning.Now I can confidently say that it's one of the better places on campus for bbq and I'll be coming back for their full rack of ribs in the next week or two.",

Everything I've ordered has been good, but my go-to is the 2-meat combo platter, which comes with 2 sides and is a great value for the amount of food you get (I always leave feeling stuffed, and I can eat a lot). If you're into catfish, try the catfish with mustard sauce; I never get tired of it. When they have them, the beef ribs are fantastic. There is a good variety of beers on tap, and the selection is constantly changing; there is usually something for everyone. I've found their cocktails to be overly-sweet, but to be fair I've only tried a few. As everyone has mentioned, lines can be long, but the wait is worth it, especially in the summer when it's not painful to stand outside. The only bad experience I've had with waitstaff was once when a friend was asked how his beer was and he said it wasn't what he expected and then got interrogated rather uncomfortably by the waiter about what he meant. Usually everyone is fairly pleasant, even when the restaurant is packed and hectic. As others have also mentioned, if you want burnt ends go early!",

If the line is long already, put your name and QTY of guests in your party on the board and then run over to Bunny's for a round of Bloody Marys. If you show up during peak dinner hours, there will be an hour wait. Burnt ends - burnt ends sell out quickly. Make sure to get your order in quickly when they open. Platters - platters are a great way to sample several meats and you get two sides. They also have an extensive BBQ sauce list. For a few bucks, you can order all the sauces for your table.Drink - they have a great beer menu with awesome craft beers on tap. If you like whiskey, there is a tasting menu for that too.To go - you can do to go orders via phone, however the bartenders are really busy so it may be a wait before they pick up the line. Splitting the check - they have a cool tablet-based point of sale system. It is easy for the waitress to split the tab for groups and you pay at your table.Group size - this restaurant is good for parties of 4 or under. Parties of 1-2 can get sat more promptly as there is seating at the bar. While I see people with kids here, it is not a kid friendly restaurant - very small interior,crowded, loud, not sure if they have high chairs.",

The cuban sandwich (Wed special) is great with fries and a side of the mustard BBQ sauce. The burgers are also good and several are topped with BBQ meats. If you're starving, and they haven't run out yet, get an appetizer order of burnt ends to share with your pals! I like the chicken wings tossed in hot Georgia peach if I'm there for beer and a snack.",

                "review": "This place is without a doubt, the BEST BBQ IN ILLINOIS. My boyfriend went to U of I and we somehow stumbled upon this hidden gem. Well, I suppose it's not so hidden since there is usually a long wait. But don't be discouraged! The wait is well worth it, I promise. Try to make your way through the door, find the guy in charge, and put your name on the list. There's not much space in this place. I guess that would be my one complaint. It can get pretty crunched, especially if you're waiting. However, what is better to tide you over than a delicious beer? Now, let's talk about this beer.They have new selections on tap all the time. Please, do your beer pallet a favor and don't order the usual domestics and imports (Miller, Bud, Heiniken, Corona, etc). Those are just fine for any regular restaurant. Why miss the glorious opportunity to try something mind-blowingly good? Seriously, these beers are amazing. They come from different breweries across the country. Places/companies you've never heard of. Combinations of flavors you would never think to try. I once had an oyster beer here. Sounds disgusting but it was so good. Trust me on that. I'm very picky and I liked it. You can also get a flight of 7 beers on a dogbone shaped tray (how fitting!). This flight has all the beers that are on tap in 4 oz glasses. You can share them with a friend and then order the one you like best!Now, on to the food. So SO good. There are a few different sauce choices you can get. Not being one for spicy, I get the Georgia Peach. It is soo good on anything you get. There is no bad item on this menu. The pulled pork is amazing as are the hamburgers. Hard to believe a hamburger could be so good, but it is. The brisket is also amazing. They cook it for 12 hours. How could it not be? Try to get here relatively early though, because some items like the brisket run out later in the evening. While it's a bummer, think of it as a good thing. This way, you know they're not just heating it in the microwave. They cook it, and once it's gone, it's gone. Oh and the fries are amazing, whether you get the regular or sweet potato.I know this was a long review, but I really can't say enough about this place. I'm obsessed. It's a bummer that my bf graduated so we can't go all the time since we live near Chicago. However, I will make any excuse to go down. Going there this weekend for Halloween. Can't wait to visit my favorite BBQ place in all the land!",

Correctly reviewed, there was a wait at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday evening. We signed in on the board as soon as we arrived (again, thanks to a review) - good to know this or we would have been standing around outside in the brisk weather until we happened to figure it out. We waited about a half hour and were seated at the bar. Service was okay, not stellar. So we ordered the \"burnt ends\". I'm not sure what we should have expected, but two fatty slices of brisket were not to my liking. If you like fatty prime rib, then you will be in heaven. The rib tips had a good flavor, were a bit on the tough side for me, hubby enjoys chewing so he didn't mind them. The sauces were just okay, hubby didn't like any we tried and we were charged extra for each sauce. The cornbread was good. Overall, this a good BBQ place, not the best we have eaten, not the worst we have eaten. Not a place for cheap beer - one draft cost $6.00.  We have a much better BBQ join in Indianapolis - if you ever drive thru, try Squealers.",

I've been a  \"peskaterian/vegetarian\" for over 4 years but upon a recent trip down south decided to indulge in some good ol' southern BBQ, and well... I'm a little lax in the meat eating department now. At least when it comes quality, well cooked, BBQ. You wont see me scarfing down a McRib, or eating meat anywhere else for that matter but give me some Black Dog pulled pork and I'll make an exception. You walk in and write your name and party number on the sheet. I've been here twice now and it was spot on both times. You'll have to wait a little unless you get take out but it's worth it.They have different specials each night and tend to run out of stuff so go early if you have your heart set on the burnt ends (I've yet to try them because they were sold out both times).  First time I got the 1/2 rack of ribs with mac & cheese, and coleslaw.Second time they only had 1/4 rack of ribs so I got the pick two with the pulled pork, coleslaw, and baked beans. Pulled pork was amazing! Tender and smokey, and full of flavor. That will be my go to order now. Mac and cheese is indulgent and delicious, coleslaw is of the vinegar (not creamy) variety which I love. Baked beans (they call them something else) were good, but too heavy for me personally. I'd eat them again though. The ribs were my favorite until I tried the pulled pork. They're still a close second.I could be a good vegetarian and the get the portabello sandwich with fresh chevre and roasted red pepper that sounds amazing, and maybe I will one day when my conscience overcomes me. But there's something for everyone there, so non-meat eaters will be just as satisfied I'm sure.",

Based on what I'd heard and read I expected the meat to be on point and have some passion infused into it.  Pork - The pork had great flavor, was cooked perfectly and didn't have a single piece of gristle in it.  It went well with any of the sauces (I had the flight)Brisket - A disappointment.  It was either an inferior cut of meat or it was cooked wrong.  I could barely pull it apart with my hands as it was tough.  Once I finally got it apart it was tough and chewy.. It seemed like it had decent flavor in it, but was overshadowed by the texture of it.  Sides - baked beans - very good.. had a bit of bacon in them and had great flavor. Applesauce - I wanted something light and this hit the spot.  Its applesauce, not much to screw up. Sauces - I liked the chipotle bbq.  It had great flavor and a little bit of spice.  The texas bbq and milo's mustard were also my favorites.. good all around flavor.  I didn't care for the peach ones, but to each his own, the others were good as well . I travel thru here for work so I'll swing by again and give it another whirl, but I'll probably steer clear of the brisket for a bit.. maybe I\"ll try the burnt ends?  Till next time.",

I've never been a huge fan of coleslaw, but the way theirs is prepared, and ON the actual sandwich, is just delicious. The sweet potato fries are too good as is any other side I've ever ventured to try.Also the, I think it's called the Carolina burger, a fat delicious burger with pulled pork on top is really good too!You may very well have to wait, but it is so so so worth it.",

Unfortunately, because they have such a selection of sauces, it's not really feasible to cook the meat with the sauce, so the sauce is just added to your order at the end.  Good, but not as good as it could be.  Having the options makes up for it though.The reason it only gets three stars is because the restaurant is too small.  There isn't enough room for large groups to sit together, and if you're not early, there will be a very long wait.  It's also fairly loud (small space, lots of people, of course it's loud).",

Having heard that the burnt ends sell out quickly, my friends and I got there at 5 (apparently the have a batch of burnt ends at 11 AM and 5 PM) to a minimal line, and got seated after about 10 minutes of waiting.  As good as everything on the menu sounded, I knew I had to have the burnt ends, so I ordered a burnt ends sandwich.I took my first bite of my burnt ends sandwich and instantly the only things I could think were, \"Oh my god this is amazing\" and \"What have I been doing the last four years of my life?\".  The burnt ends had a delicious smoke flavor which were complemented very well by the Carolina Red BBQ sauce, which has a slight bit of heat.  I also enjoyed the soft cornmeal dusted bun that the meat came on.  I found this sandwich to go really well with the draft Arrogant Bastard that I had.  For my side I had the regular fries, which were good, but nothing extraordinary.  The burnt ends were the true standout here.  It's a shame I didn't come here before I ended up graduating, but I guess I avoided gaining 10 pounds from eating here all the time if I did.",

I was wrong.The wait was probably 30 minutes, but the beer selection and the ability to get the beers in different sizes made the wait a non-factor.Sat at the bar and the prices were more than reasonable with very laid back friendly service.  Not the world's best BBQ, but very good.  The atmosphere learns a lot to the senses and I enjoyed the meal.  The smoked sweet potato was a perfect side dish.  Rib tips were not the meatiest tips I've had, but very good.  Wife had the brisket and was impressed.  Not too moist, not too dry, the way she likes it.Serving size isn't huge, but enough to fill the belly after some beers.  Definitly a worth while visit.Great staff, service, atmosphere, beer, and food.  What else could I ask for, I guess I paid the cheap Urbana parking meter, but I'm sure there is a free lot and I think the parking is free after hours.",

But we got right in, only waiting 5 minutes for a table at 6pm.We split way too many apps, but everything looked so darn good!!  Smoked almonds (house smoked, with a touch of sweetness - love, especially for $3!), wings (expensive but OK, with sauce that catches up with you around wing #3), Texas caviar (with black eyed peas and hominy - very nice) and chips and salsa (meh).  Drinks all around too.  I had a bloody mary made with horseradish vodka (yum) and a margarita made with hoppy tequila (yum!!!).I ordered a combo plate.  $12 for your choice of two meats (I had burnt ends and pulled pork) and two sides (spicy potato salad and pit beans - both delish).  Really good amount of food for the price!  Others at my table had the brisket (dry), sweet potato fries (an upcharge but very worth it if you're a fan of them), the burger with brisket, sauce, onions and cheese on it (she loved it) and the twice-baked potato casserole (everyone wanted to lick this bowl clean).This was my first time trying burnt ends, and I must say I was disappointed.  I expected blackened meat all around, like I've seen on the Food Network, and these were just the black ring around brisket that I normally get... when I order brisket.We all loved the potato salad and the potato casserole.  In fact, we loved all the sides and apps.  If there was a way to get just a plate of sides, I'd never leave.Hopping place!  A constant waiting line, on a Tuesday.  Good service, but a little scatterbrained.",

I am only familiar with Memphis BBQ, but the last time I was in Memphis, I was wishing I was at Black Dog. I used to be crazy about their cole slaw, but in the past year or two the recipe seems to have changed. I will still get it on a sandwich, but not as a side also. The first time I went here was a friday night in Nov 2008 and I think there were three occupied tables in the whole place. Now, you should definitely plan on a wait for pretty much any night of the week. That is frustrating if you show up hungry but it's also part of the charm and quaintness of the restaurant. Lunch time is not quite as busy, but still busy during lunch rush. I appreciate the addition of a couple veggie options on the menu (portabello sandwich and grilled cheese). Great addition to the area and excited to hear they are opening another location. Since I've moved out of town I really miss this place :(",

You go inside and write your name on the list. The wait list does move at a decent pace so you won't be waiting forever. On average, I've waited 20-40 minutes. Meanwhile, you can get a beer from the bar. They have a large selection and used to have flights of beer. Their fresh-squeezed lemonade is so good! There's also a waiting area with a table outside where you can enjoy a beverage. You can't go wrong with any of the food on their menu. Everything is delicious - from their entrees (e.g., brisket sandwiches, smoked chicken, smoked catfish; my fave: burnt ends) to their sides (e.g., twice-baked casserole, pit beans; my fave: cornbread embedded with bits of smoked meats and beans) to their bbq sauces (my fave: Milo's Mustard; runner up: Georgia Peach). There are daily specials as well. Even if you picked something at random, it'll be delicious. The space is small for the crowd that it tries to accommodate. It can get hot in the summer. There are booths, a few tables, and bar seating. Two tv's are playing in the already loud & cramped dining room. The wait staff seems constantly rushed because so many people come in to eat here. So they'll get you in and out.Pro: The food is a tasty 5-starCon: Crowded, they run out of things",

There was also a guy walking out telling me, \"not worth the wait.\" I didn't think too much of it because the place looked promising. We went back to eat it and took about 10 mins figuring out who ordered what. They place all of our food together in 3 bags, which was fine, but they didn't labeled anything. We ordered the combo which included pulled pork, slab of ribs, and rib tips. I only tried the ribs and tips, but they were really dry and the sauce didn't make it any better. I have tried many great ribs, but this one definitely don't cut it. As busy as it gets here, the guy was right, definitely not worth the wait.",

My suggestion would be the cornbread (filled with green chiles, pit beans, cheese and pulled pork) and the burnt ends sandwich. If you've read a lot of reviews about this place, you're probably already curious about these \"burnt ends\" people talk about. Black Dog cuts off the point of a brisket that has been smoked for 12 hours, cover it in dry rub again, then smoke for an additional 12 hours. There isn't a lot, so if I'm craving this sandwich, I go right at the opening because it's sure to run out fast.They have a variety of sauces, which is great for those who like tang, spicy, sweet, etc. As for the beer, I hear there's a lot of great ones there, but I've never ordered one myself. (I'm not really a 11am drinker.)However, be warned -- it is a SMALL and popular place, so there's bound to be a wait. This isn't something I'd take a star off though because I always get great food and I like the atmosphere. When a place is that busy in a part of Urbana people can't even see easily from the main road, it's a good sign the food is great. If you just want to try it, go at 11am when they open or call ahead and order out.",

However, none of those restaurants deserve the word that I'm going to use to describe Black Dog.That word, friends, is Flavortown.Like the lost city of Atlantis, I was skeptical of Flavortown's existence for the longest time. As I was about to abort my lifelong, 22 year quest, I stumbled upon the fabled Flavortown.The journey was difficult, if you consider a long wait difficult. Luckily we only had to wait a half hour or so, with the hostess constantly telling waiting patrons to \"shut the front door.\" After a trying wait, my squadron of 6 was seated. For drinks, one gentleman and I ordered Arnold Palmers, and I would be lying if I said it wasn't the best damn Arnold Palmer I've ever had, and I don't even like Arnold Palmers. The other party members ordered various drinks, as well as chips, salsa, and hummus.The wait and service were reasonable, and the menu, extensive. I went balls deep and ordered a full slab of ribs with Texas and Lexington sauces, along with fries and applesauce.The food came, and I discovered the lost city of Flavortown. At $27 something, it wasn't a cheap meal (since I bought the chips and salsa and Arnold Palmer) but that's money. I wish the Arnold Palmer came with a free refill, but, once again, that's money, and excellence isn't cheap.The only con of the meal is I had this looming feeling that Guy Fieri was going to barge in at any second and steal my ribs, but when you're on vacation at Flavortown, you have to endure these thoughts.10/10",

The first night I had the hot Polish sausage and the catfish. I'm not normally much of a fish eater, but it was so good I ended up having the catfish the second night as well, along with the brisket. The meats were perfectly cooked and so smoky and juicy that you really didn't need the sauces for either the flavor or moisture, although their sauces could have a review of their own. For the sides, I tried the smoked sweet potato, the cornbread, and the pit baked beans.  I'm always looking for baked beans with great flavor and most of the time I'm disappointed with sweet flavored beans that taste like they've come from the store. Black Dog's beans are the best I've had anywhere and I would go back just for the beans alone.   The smoky cornbread was exceptional, and the smoked sweet potato with just a touch of butter and brown sugar was amazing. Whenever I visit the Champaign-Urbana area (and by area I mean anywhere within a hundred miles!), the Black Dog will be my first stop for dinner.",

This place is amazing.  I've been there many times, with many people.  Virtually everyone has been impressed.  The sauces are good, the meat is wonderful, and the specials are interesting.  If you are a beer fan (I am) they consistently have interesting beer in a variety of styles.  The taps rotate very frequently, so it's almost always a different set of choices when you go.  They also get some limited release stuff, like cask-aged beers.  It's awesome.  I'm not as much a cocktail drinker, but they also have their own infused liquors and cocktails made with them.  I think the sandwiches are the best deal, and they are consistently great.  Tender pulled pork, the always-in-demand and frequently out of stock burnt ends, and delicious brisket.  You can also get the meat on top of a burger for a decadent and delicious treat.  And the sides are all good too!  Potato salad with actual flavor instead of just mayonnaise!  The best sweet potato fries I've ever had!  The platters seem like you maybe get a bit less food per dollar, but they're still good.  I still have to give the nod to Lil Porgies for ribs, overall, but Black Dog is king for sandwiches.Specials include things like smoked salmon, muffaleta sandwiches, and burritos or tacos.  They've had a couple charity nights with homemade ramen.  If you see one of  these and you like ramen at all - go.  This is the closest to real Japanese ramen I've had, with awesome barbecue twists like a hard boiled egg that's been smoked and is still, somehow, gooey in the middle.  Absolutely wonderful.The downside?  Black Dog is so good there's often a line.  It's not a huge place.  It wouldn't be good at all for a group of more than 6 people.  And waits of 30 minutes or more are not uncommon.  Don't be surprised by that - this isn't the place to go for a quick bite.  (Though they do offer take-out.)   Overall?  Black Dog is really, really good.  It makes you feel good to eat here.  If you like barbecue at all - especially Carolina style - you should go here.  Yes, there will probably be a wait - because the secret's out.",

Typically when I think of good bbq I think of being able to gorge into the melt-in-your-mouth meat. Although black dog's has got the melt-in-your-mouth part down, I find myself having to limit each bite. Personally, this isn't how I expect a great bbq experience to be. However that's the only issue I have and I can't argue with how the food tastes. It's definitely worth the visit.",

                "review": "\"Best Food In Champaign-Urbana!\"Although there is always generally a wait, and if you want their delicious Burnt Ends you have to come early in the evening, Black Dog is well worth it. Nearly everything you order at Black Dog is excellent. The southern-style smoky greatness of their BBQ and sides is mouth watering. Black Dog offers a great list of whiskeys and also serves many good micro-brews. Burnt Ends and Spare Ribs are extremely good, as is their side order of Smoky Pit Beans. Occasionally I'll order a Carolina Burger, which is a burger with pull pork on top, when I want to mix things up. Many people rave about their corn bread, as it is also delicious. Daily specials help keep the mix of food fresh, however I could never grow tired of Black Dog. Recently the restaurant started serving special Late Night items after 10:30pm that features special cocktails and menu items (like Gourmet Hot Dogs/Sausages) that you cannot order during regular hours, which are great as well. Try Black Dog, you won't regret it, but you might just feel frustrated thinking about the soonest time you can come back for more. Note: When choosing a sauce, Hot Georgia Peach is the way to go. (But hell, you can order a Flight of Sauces and try them all for yourself. Enjoy!)",

Seriously, I want to just go in with $50 and be like, \"Load me up on the burnt tips.\"Besides that, I had brisket which was good. I feel like a lot of the smoked brisket I've had before tends to be very tender, but to the point where it's just like shreddy beef sinews. I appreciated that, though this brisket was tender, it had some structural integrity. Twice baked potato casserole was killer and the sweet tea was cloyingly sweet (which is the only way to make sweet tea). I also had slaw, which I didn't love and the sauce was pretty vinegary. But those burnt ends. It was enough to make me look past the little things.I'll be back. You bet I will. And I'll be back for burnt ends (but other good stuff too.)",

The ribs were yummie but were not fall off the bone type.  Despite this, the meat was still very tender. With the ribs came two sides. I opted for the spicy potato salad and the sweet potato fries. I liked both the sides but I think I enjoyed the spicy potato salad more.The corn bread is its own beast.  It is OUTSTANDING. It is definitely corn bread you probably have never tasted anywhere else. They put moist sweet pork meat in it!!!! What a wonderful surprise. I could eat a bunch of it up!Overall food was good, service was good, and our food came out fast. A great experience!

I've had it all over the country, from the dry rub of Memphis to the vinegar based sauces of North Carolina to the beef ribs of Texas. I'm not an expert, but I do know what tastes good.Black Dog tastes good.I've had the burnt tips (in my opinion, the burnt ends of food are always the best) and the brisket, and both were succulent. A huge plus for me is that the food doesn't come drenched in sauce. That way you can actually taste the meat and the rub and get a true feel for the barbecue. I love the baked beans, mainly because they have little pieces of pork in them. The fries are nice and crispy, which I love. After coming from a hard workout, I was able to demolish the combo platter with a slightly too full feeling, so it's a lot of food. Normally I can't eat that much. I still haven't bought ribs, so that's the next thing to try.Because of the hype around this place, the service is not always the best. It's small and a bit cramped as well. This is why it only gets 4 stars. I wonder if they'll have a patio this summer, because honestly I can think of nothing better than a plate of barbecue, warm weather, and cold beer.",

About 8 rotating taps of quality micros from around the nation and some Belgians as well.  They also have a rotating cask which is great.  Plenty of bottles as well.  I enjoyed Summit Oatmeal Stout on cask.All fine and good, but the food left something to be desired for me.  I wanted the burnt ends sandwich.  They were out, that is not a problem at all.  It is great that they can go through the good stuff like that.  I ended up with a half rack of pork spare ribs.  The ribs are very good.  I did enjoy them, but not great.  I do not like the BBQ sauce at all.  it is like a tomato paste, almost marinara like.  The sides are crap though.  Mac and cheese seemed like it was sitting out forever.  Similar to old mac and cheese that has been sitting out and hardened for hours after Christmas diner.  The slaw seemed almost rancid.  I could not eat it.  Luckily I did not get a sandwich that would have been covered in it.Overall, I really wanted to love this place.  The meat is very good though not great, and got to love the beer selection.  As well as a very nice Bourbon selection.  Though overall, I think the reviews here are a bit of a home town bias.  I will continue to support these guys, but not up to the hype I had been expecting.",

Also they only offer it for two meals a week, which is actually fine because it isn't very good, but still for me at least I expect more from a barbecue restaurant. Order the twice baked potato casserole instead and you won't be disappointed.",

Great food -- always busy (get there right at 11 or after 1, then right at 5 but after 7 to avoid the lunch/dinner rush -- otherwise you'll be standing in a long line)  BUT I have a few issues:1.  It's kid friendly only if your kid can sit by himself in a chair.   There are no high chairs in this place -- probably because the tables and booths are fairly high (booths are on risers, tables are tall bar tables) so you either have to tag team with another person in your party to hold your kid while the other eats OR bring your own portable high chair that attaches to one of the booths OR hire a babysitter and have a parents' night out.2.  Prices.   Prices are fairly reasonable considering all the food is local, but some of the specials seem a little bit over-priced.   I mean, Monday's they have a Chicago style hot dog.... $6.95 for a hot dog seems pretty steep.  As well as the beef stroganoff....we ordered a takeout order of this and it came in one of those small takeout soup containers.  It rang in to around $11.95 if I'm not mistaken.... YIKES.   I would stick with the sandwiches for $6.95 with one side.  A platter is $11.95 -- basically the same thing (minus the bun) + two sides.   The price jump from a sandwich to a platter doesn't seem worth it to me.Those are my two issues.  We eat here at least once a week and I LOVE the pulled pork sandwich, the Cuban sandwich, and the burnt end sandwich (although the last couple times I had it, it was dry).  My side of choice is either the potato salad (to die for!) or a side salad (all local,fresh vegetables....so refreshing!!!).UPDATE:  they now have highchairs!  The kind that attach to the table.  We actually bought a Phil and Ted portable high chair to specifically bring with us to BD, but they beat us to it....  So now i only have the one issue about their prices.  BTW -- their smoked chicken is WONDERFUL as well as their pit beans.   If you're wondering what to feed your 10 month old baby, try little bits of chicken, pulled pork, the sweet potato and some beans!",

However, once we were sat, and having ordered the beef brisket and pulled pork with Carolina vinegar BBQ sauce and sides of the Southern Potato Salad and cornbread, which came pretty quick for a packed restaurant, I understood why, even on weekday nights, this place is constantly stuffed.The moment I put some of the meat in my mouth (without the sauce, which, by the way, is homemade) the fragrance of the smoke spread throughout my mouth and nose and it was just orgasmic. The meat was tender and juicy. Dipped in the sauce it was an entirely different world with a tangy and warm touch, yet without losing the flavour of the meat. Incredible. The potato salad was very well made and the cornbread, which I was not expecting to have meat and beans mixed in ( I was thinking of a sweet cornbread like at Famous Dave's) was nonetheless delicious.This, my friends, is barbecue of the highest order.",

It's no longer a great value. If you buy a sandwich, side, and a drink, you're spending around $13 (counting tax and tip). Yeah, I get that some of their meat is coming from local farms and stuff and it's more expensive as a result. I really don't care. The use of local animals has priced me out of the restaurant. 2. The wait times are completely unacceptable. Unless you eat between 2-4pm, you can count on a wait of around 30-45 minutes. It's okay if you want this to be your major activity of the night, but sadly, it's no longer a place where you can stop in for a quick and inexpensive BBQ sandwich. The mix of inconvenience and increased cost has led me to downgrade my review of what was formerly one of my favorite restaurants. Also, I'm not nearly as impressed with the quality of the food after trying Smoque BBQ in Chicago. Previously, I thought that Black Dog was amongst the best BBQ in the nation, but as good as it is, there is no comparison to Smoque when it comes to the meat.",

The burnt ends are probably considered to be the specialty here, and they're typically out of them by 1 or 2 due to the popularity, but the true specialty is just outstanding, mouthwatering food. Aside from the everyday options of pulled pork, brisket, ribs and catfish, they also have great daily specials, such as pork tacos on Tuesday and an incredible cuban sandwich on Wednesday. And not to be forgotten, the sides and appetizers are killer as well.The long wait at usual dinner and lunch hours is well documented, but there is a wait because everyone who's heard of the place dreams of eating all of their meals there, all of the time.If you're stopping in for the first time, you'll never go wrong with a cornbread appetizer, sides of pit beans and twice baked potato casserole, and pulled pork with the georgia peach sauce.",

They only have limited amounts made and the burnt ends do run out very quickly. Also, pay the extra 50 cents and get the sweet potato fries, honestly it will be the only place around the area that serve them and it is definitely a fresh new taste compared to the typical fries! I don't like sweet potatoes but these fries were worth trying!My friends and I also got the wings as an appetizer once and I always order them now since they were so good! It comes with lots of meat & good flavor so get them to share so you have plenty of room for their entreePLEASE don't pass this place up!

They have random pieces of art on the wall I mistakenly took for coat hangers...  but the servers are pretty good at seating you and there's a great atmosphere.  Clients licking their fingers, loving their food, and servers knowing their food is prized.  Don't waste your time on the spicy potato salad, but pair your meal with sweet tea, sweet potato fries or amazing smoked beans.  They don't joke around with their smoked flavor.  I have never tasted such 'smokiness' ever.They ran out of brisket and the pulled chicken, but i guess that's what happens when everything tastes like home-cooked goodness.  I'll be back very soon to try their rib tips and wings.",

Whatever, I know, \"don't overhype,\" but for the price and location it is fantastic.Best dishes: Burnt ends, which are smoked for twelve hours (!) and usually sell out at some point during the lunch shift (comes with the Carolina sauce, which is a bit spicy but genuinely amazing). Blue burger, which has blue cheese, bacon, and a peach barbecue sauce that has ruined every other blue burger I have tried so far. South Carolina burger, which has the same Carolina sauce as the burnt ends and comes with barbecue pork on top (no, it is not good for your cholestorol, but it it is totally worth it). Barbecue salmon (available as a special certain days) that seems strange in concept but basically melts into the barbecue sauce, and is (I assume) the healthiest option you'll come across. Also, the buns are weirdly good? I don't understand, but I appreciate it.Drinks: Go with a craft beer or whiskey list -- the options are many. I love the beer flights, as well.Sides: The cornbread is out of control. It comes with small bits of barbecue pork baked in. Also, it is the size of a piece of pie, so consider splitting. I would get a side of carolina sauces to dip in, it is amazing. Also, the baked beans are flavorful and made me like baked beans. Not as crazy about: The wait time, because it's a small space and the best casual dining in town. I would consider going at opening or in the mid-day lull. But I think they're opening a new location. Also, not a huge fan of the brisket (which is cool, because everything else is life changing).",

It was nice that we could have a drink while we waiting outside.  We were also able to look at menus while we waited so we didn't lose time.  We were able to order as soon as we were seated.First they have a great selection of hard ciders.  So for the non-beer drinker I can say hurray! First round for appetizer we had the cornbread...oh yeah delicious.  There were 3 of us doing the geometry to divide it up so we each got the same amount.  If we didn't have a ton of other food coming we would have ordered another.I had the pulled pork with the special chipotle slaw, baked beans, twice baked casserole.  OMG the chipotle slaw was so good on the pork that I ordered another side so I could finish my pork with it.  The smoke in the beans is no joke.  I mean they need to bottle and sell this.  I could eat it all the time.  So good I mixed it into the already amazing twice baked potato casserole.  Heaven! Mom had the beef brisket with chipotle slaw with twice bake casserole.  Needless to say, it was eaten with enjoyment.! The brisket just melted in the mouth.  And she was so happy when I ordered more of the chipotle slaw, it also complemented the brisket quite nicely.Dad had ribs, brisket, and polish sausage with the special side of green beans and smoked sweet potato. As with the rest of the meal yum!  The ribs fell of the bone.  And the pairing of the sausage and the Texas sauce was perfect.I just never had a bad bite.

                "review": "After calling around to all the BBQ places in town, we decided to go with Black Dog for a catering event for 200-300 people.  We got 20 lb. pulled pork, 20 lb. pulled chicken, buns, sauce, potato salad and cole slaw.  They were absolutely fantastic to work with (for instance, offering pulled chicken even though that's not on their catering menu) and the price was the best around (compared to Famous Dave's, Blues, Lil Porgy's, and Hickory River).  The food was such a hit with the crowd that those of us working the event didn't get a chance to eat much of it, so we went back to Black Dog afterwards and got dinner!  The potato casserole is divine, the potato salad is spicy and delicious, and the meat is just phenomenal.  I've tried the Carolina Red and the Chipotle sauce, both of which were delicious.The restaurant itself is tiny and was packed on a Friday night, so while turnover is pretty fast, expect to wait 10-20 minutes if you come at a busy time.  The staff is extremely nice and helpful, and food comes out pretty fast, so no complaints there.  Prices are pretty standard--about $7 for sandwich and a side, $10-12 for a platter with 1-2 meats and 2 sides.  Definitely worth trying!",

After having the burnt ends sandwich, I would be more than inclined to try them again (both the restaurant and the dish). The flavors were rich and smokey, and the sauces perfectly complimented the meats  and dishes overall. Our server was very personable, and helpful when we needed to make menu decisions. A nice sort of tavern atmosphere with heavenly smells and an energy that resonates from the busy environment. I can not recommend this restaurant highly enough, when we are in the area again, we'll no doubt be asking about Black Dog.",

Not that LA is known for bbq, but neither is East Central Illinois, so I'll continue.  STILL, I eat at a barbecue/beer joint every week, more than once a week in Los Angeles and BLACK DOG makes me feel embarrassed that I spend $20 on a pulled pork sandwich, a beer and a tip at Blues BBQ in West Hollywood.  6.95 for a burnt tips or ends or whatever sandwich AND a side [I had potato salad and dipped those spuds into every one of my sauce flight sauces].    And like $4 for a glass of what our AWESOME, nice-sporty-but-down-to-earth-witty waiter    waiter called a REALLY nice PBR.  I got there at 11:00 and watched the place fill up to the point where we had to use a back exit to get a baby in a stroller and a 4-year-old out of the restaurant.  But they HAD A BACK DOOR and they let us use it which made us feel cool and made them look cool for being accommodating.  It probably wasn't even a secret door, but we felt grateful all the same.  The vegetarian 4-year-old happily ate an awesome looking provolone grilled sandwich, so Imma just put that out there in case your vegetarian self gets pulled along to Black Dog.  Nice-sporty-but-down-to-earth-witty waiter sampled us beer, gave me an extra sauce when I decided which one from my flight was the best [I liked Georgia Peach] and was really attentive despite a full-house at 11:30 a.m. I got out of there full-to-the-brim and more satisfied than I've been in awhile [good bbq paired with beer is a wonderful lover] for less than $12 [excluding the big ol' tip he deserved].  Why is CU so great??  If someone wanted the short version of what my BBQ at Black Dog experience was, I would yell:  \"LEGIT AS HELL.\" and hope that summed up the flava', waiter and atmosphere.",

I was really excited before the first visit because of all the great reviews on Yelp, and I ended up being sadly disappointed in my dry beef brisket sandwich and slightly metallic-tasting pit beans (although being that I don't often come across foods that taste of metal, I wrote it off as a problem with my mouth that evening). This experience really struck me deeply...I'd never had an eating experience that contradicted so sharply with a Yelp consensus. Was something wrong with me? I began to feel quite gastronomically insecure.I gave it a second try recently, opting for a plate of rib tips along with an order of potato salad and corn on the cob. Again, a sunken heart. About half of the rib tips were great, while the other half were terribly dry and tough; I had to force myself to finish them. As for the sides, the corn on the cob was mushy and bland, but the spicy potato salad was pretty enjoyable. We threw a sampler beer flight into the mix, which was probably the best part of the meal (and a good value to boot, being that you net out at more beer for less money than most of the single glasses). I'm sorry to say that Black Dog is oh-for-two. Maybe I just had bad luck in picking the worst items on the menu or coming in on bad days, but now that I'm no longer living in the area (this was my last dinner in Chambana), it unfortunately may never have an opportunity to redeem itself again with me. Au revoir, dawg.",

Speaking of which, you don't know me and I don't know you but you should get it.  Really.  It's an awesome smoked and resmoked brisket sandwich that is so many layers of delicious, it's stupid.  It's juicy, flavorful and the sauce is done just right; present but not overwhelming.  The slaw is a correctly done supporting cast in the sandwich.  Also, coming it at around $7, it was easily tastier than more expensive crap I've paid for out here on the West Coast.Combine this hunger inducing (and curing) sandwich with a delightful Dark Horse Tres Blueberry Stout enjoyed on draft (not to mention the availability of a number of craft beers on draft and in bottle) and the chill atmosphere and I was more than happy I braved the rain to visit this spot before heading back to Chicago.Even if it wasn't in Urbana, this place would be able to hang in any big city either as just a beer bar or as a BBQ place.

They often have specials, which so far have also been great.There are still a few small kinks, such as only having four napkin dispensers along the entire bar that seats 15 or so people (I had to ask for napkins, which one should never need to do at a barbecue joint! And then they needed to be taken away for someone else, and I had to ask for them again...). Hopefully the owners read reviews and/or use their common sense to iron out what few flaws currently exist.",

My friend, a recent transplant to the area, suggested a \"pretty sweet BBQ place\" instead of the much closer and cheaper McDonald's near his apartment. \"Oh, and they also have their own beer.\" Sold. So, walking in, the seating space is really rather small for a pub/restaurant - and way too hungry to wait for a table - so we just sat at the bar. I Yelped this place before leaving and was told to try the Burnt Ends but to get there early to do so. Well, they were out. And they were also out of catfish. Luck of the draw of coming in late on an NFL playoff game day, I suppose. I ended up getting the rib tips with regular French fries and the Southwestern potato salad, with the Left Hand Milk Stout to drink. I mean, if I'm gonna carbo-load, why not do it in style?Anyway, our first server ended up also giving me a small sample of a blueberry ale just in case I'd be coming back or ordering more beer with my dinner. I suppose if I liked blueberries, I'd be all over this, but I'm not such a fan... however, I certainly appreciate the offer. I also ended up having the one beer of theirs they had on tap the night before at a bar, so I didn't want to double dip and ended up going with a Hennepin saison instead.The food finally came, after many delays informing my friend that supply was limited on catfish and eventually running out of it. The Carolina Red BBQ sauce is very tasty but has a hidden kick to it. With the rib tips, it was perfect. That said - though the fries were great (but maybe a bit skimpy on the serving size) and the Southwestern potato salad was good (but I was almost hoping for it to be a bit closer to room temperature), the rib tips themselves were tender and flavorful, but I thought there was a bit too much fat on them, whether marbled in or around the little bits of bone. The parts closer to the edges were fine, but towards the center were tricky. I don't want to imply that this is standard practice, but due to having to cancel both items my friend ordered, he was able to substitute something else on the menu and get comped for it on the bill. Much appreciated. However, our original server kind of disappeared for a while so we ended up being served by a guy that sort of looks like Paul McCartney around 1968, and he did a great job.",

                "review": "I've had Black Dog three ways -- as an in-house meal, as carry-out eaten right nearby (so no heat was lost), and at a catered event at the South Research Park.The meat is really, really good. Tender with a deep-smoke, slow-cook flavor -- the pork is excellent (especially on the bone), the chicken is good. The quality is consistent -- good every time. I keep hearing about the amazing burnt ends, but I have not yet lucked into finding them available. They run out early and frequently.The sauces are average to below average. Sorry -- Porgy's (another local bbq joint) has much more robust and flavorful sauce (Texas style). I'm not just talking about one sauce -- I've had several (including the Georgia Peach, which a friend recommended). The sauces tend to be light on flavor and thin on substance. The sides are anywhere from excellent to okay. My favorite is the twice-baked potato casserole. Amazingly rich and delicious. A friend had the Southwestern potato salad and also loved it, except he said it was room temp rather than cold or warm. The sweet potato fries are good, but not great (they could use a dusting of curry powder or something). The pit beans have a nice meat flavor (bacon added) but also suffer from the same thin base, weak seasoning, and lack of complexity as the sauces. The coleslaw is bad. The cabbage is thick cut and bitter, the vinegar dressing nearly flavorless. I'm not a fan of NC bbq, and this reminds me of a bad side in NC (where I lived for a year).The stuffed cornbread appetizer is very good -- a wedge of dense and flavorful not-too-sweet skillet bread with some meat and extras worked in. But it too should be served warm and with butter, rather than slightly cool from the fridge.In all, if you are a meat lover willing to doctor or add your own sauce, Black Dog offers superior entre fair. The sides are kind of hit or miss -- choose what others recommend.The restaurant is in a very small space, so go early, expect to wait, or even accept getting turned away (happened to us once). Other people have told me the bar is good, but I don't drink and couldn't sit through the noise if I did. The place is usually packed and extremely loud. Just standing at the counter waiting to pay, I felt like my head was being banged on a gong. I also had to navigate a small, packed entryway going both in and out -- that may not seem like much, but it's tough on us quiet types. The good news is Black Dog offers a full carryout menu and accepts all credit cards except American Express. They do a good job of packing up the food to go, too.",

I was beyond pleased with the food when it first opened (before the liquor license even), and even more thrilled now that there is a full bar and decent beer selection. The last time I went, the restaurant was offering beer flights. It was my bad luck that the flight they had that week was all dark beers (not my fave) but they do change the offerings in the flight. I always get the burnt ends (when they're not sold out) and sweet potato fries, but the Cuban sandwich special is also delicious. PS - try the different bbq sauces!",

Little did I know the burnt ends become available at 5 p.m. After a short wait, I was able to get some ends, chicken and ribs. All were moist and smokey and excellent. They offer a wide variety of sauces, well beyond the typical hot, sweet, ketchup you find at most places. The beans were the perfect side, while the fries were just OK. A small but varied craft lineup and a bigger/better selection of whiskey (Pappy 20) left more drink options than I could even imagine sampling in one visit. A return trip is definitely in order. Just make sure you're here before 5.",

Twice-baked potatoes were an excellent side.But the best thing was the waiter; when I told him what beer I wanted, he said, \"Well, it's OK, but how often will you come here?\" He pointed me instead to a Founder's seasonal release which was phenomenal. The only problem now is: what do I do with all the beer I already have at home?Came back the following (Super Bowl) night, and the burnt ends were not sold out - and it was just as good as the night before.I will definitely be back!",

Small to the point where I would do ridiculous things and tell my group of friends \"everyone get there at 10:45am\". Oh, and your entire party has to be there if you want to be seated. But the bbq. Fantastic. Get the burnt ends if they aren't out for the day (they run out on those early). They also tend to have an interesting beer selection. Sides are good, too. My bbq of choice was the hot Georgia Peach. Personal favorite combination was the burnt ends sandwich with hot Georgia Peach sauce and sweet potato fries on the side. The cornbread is good, too (it does have meat in it though).",

I've had a variety of dishes and sides and they deserve the rating of top restaurant in Champaign!Their service on the other hand...is a different story. Perhaps they can get away with this because of the high quality food but there should be a limit to how poorly they treat customers. Examples of this include being put on hold for 5 minutes when calling for take out, hanging up and then calling back to immediately have my order taken but no apology. When dining in, I don't mind the long wait for a table but when I am seated, I have not even had a server come to my table for 10 or 15 minutes. Again, great food but don't expect great service!",

Walk up to the slab of paper, grab a sharpie and write your name down.  You'll be called when there's room for you to begin your BBQuest.A sign near the entryway notified us they were out of burnt ends and mac 'n' cheese.  We mourned this loss and regrouped in time to be seated.Let's start with the cornbread.  You can order it as a side to your main dish or as an appetizer.  The appetizer portion ($2.95) is solid enough for two people.  The cornbread contains green chiles, pit beans, cheese and pulled pork.  Boom.  Regular bread is forever ruined.If you like sauces, Black Dog allows you to order a flight of all eight of theirs for just $2.  Milo's Mustard and Carolina Red were my favorite.For my main dish, I went with a 3 meat combo.  Ribs, chicken and brisket.  Chicken was my favorite.  Succulent, soft and juicy, it paired very nicely with any sauce, but it was a home run with the mustard.The ribs were appropriately soft and smoky.  I really loved these with the Carolina Red sauce.The brisket was good, but not particularly outstanding.I live in Chicago, but Black Dog is good enough to merit a two and a half hour drive.  If you're in the area, you have to check out this temple of meat!* Saying things are \"the bomb\" was a popular expression in the early 2000s.  Despite its rapid decline in coolness, some people still use it earnestly.  Others use it ironically.  You are free to decide the context in this review.",

I am from the south so I know I can't critique everyone to such high standards but I looked up a good bbq place in CU and this popped up. I treated my mother in law with burnt ends and pulled pork. The portion sizes were definitely smaller than what I thought they would be especially for how long I had to wait (about 45 minutes). My mother in law wanted their Texas sauce but they ran out about 20 minutes after placing my order so she was stuck with spicy Carolina red. Could just be me and I could be biased but it definitely didn't taste the best at all. On the plus side there was a line out the door so I guess it could just be me but if your from the south like me you will be disappointed.",

It is very casual, like an amalgam of a bar and diner, yet welcoming to kids. Very limited seating. We arrived at 5:30 and it was perfect. Ten minutes later and we would have been waiting. When we left at 6 30 there were many waiting for a table. We take our kids with us everywhere we can and don't expect the restaurant to cater to them, especially when traveling. The staff was kind and welcoming, albeit not overly friendly like we find in Texas, which was good with us. Our server recommended the wildflower WPA (beer) for me and it was wonderful. I had the chicken salad sandwich, the girls had grilled cheese and my husband had the burnt ends sandwich with baked beans. All were phenomenal.  Very simple presentation, very complex and interesting flavors. We are from Texas and have had more than our fair share of BBQ and this was the best we've ever had. I would absolutely recommend this place if you are looking for a dive bar/diner feel with better beer, delicious food and patrons of all ages.",

You can get takeout though!Everything they sell is delicious but I love their Georgia peach sauce, their twice baked potato cassarole, and their mac and cheese. The meat is legitimately the best I've ever had.  Service used to be more perfunctory and not great for newbies but now I think servers act to ensure you know what you're getting into.

The mustard was good with the pork and the sausage. Again, being Texan I liked the hotter ones. (Hot Georgia peach, Caroline Red, and Chipotle BBQ. I don't care for vinegar sauces, so be warned their default sauce is Lexington Dip and it's a vinegar one. We had the smoked cornbread as an appetizer and it was great! It's a unique flavor and texture for cornbread, but if you like things smoked I would try it!Only thing I didn't love were the sides. I had the vinegar slaw and potato salad. The family had the pit beans, chipotle slaw and sweet potato fries, they liked theirs...above average fries/beans. Just so/so for mine. The potato salad definitely needed a kick. I put the milo mustard on it and that helped. We were sad they were out of burnt ends! I would go back to have burnt ends and try different sides. Fun place, friendly service and very busy!

It is always super busy and you have to wait in line whether it is before they open or any time during the day. Part of the demand is the small restaurant space, but the food itself is top notch and likely the best BBQ restaurant in IL. I have been here twice and only tried the burnt end sandwich. It is always too busy for me to come for dinner especially if you have a kid due to the limited booth spaces. The burnt end sandwich is a culinary masterpiece due to the nice smokiness of the the beef along with the crunch of the cole slaw and the acidity/sweetness of the georgia peach bbq sauce. I like my bbq sauce with spices and on the sweet side. They have a large selection of bbq sauce which I have not even tried yet. You also get a side which for me is the double baked potato. This is simply cooked to perfection loaded with cheese not too salty or heavy. I always want to try something else for lunch, but just knowing the burnt ends are limited makes me order this off the menu! Easily a 5 star + restaurant down here in ChampaignPros: flavorful bbq, great sauce selection, the dishes are well balance and have the right taste along with the perfect texture blendCons: you have to wait a long time if you come late, we were here 5 minutes early and the restaurant was immediately full after they opened the door and the line was forming around the cornerHidden deals:None",

Also little pearl of wisdom here... in a bind for Dad's weekend and don't want to fight the crowds?  Or for graduation?  Black dog caters (sort of).  Just call ahead and order what ever you need.  Then skip all the waiting and drive up to the back door at which point they will load pounds of meat and yummy yummy food into your car.  Best decision I ever made for Dad's weekend was ordering food from Black dog.",

If it's a bar, why are they serving such good food?  If it's a restaurant why are the seats and tables so crappy?  Plus the lines are really long, would bar patrons want to wait that long?  And if they are there for a bar aren't they going to take up seats for a long time so people can't eat?I like the food but the concept seems pretty conflicted.  Work it out, be a bar or a restaurant and accommodate one set of customers.  I hope it's the restaurant with new seating.  Arf arf.",

I had a triple combo platter with pulled pork, ribs, and burnt ends with sweet potato fries and cornbread. The pulled pork and ribs were delicious but those burnt ends were special. So melt-in-your-mouth delicious, would definitely recommend above anything. I got the Georgia peach barbecue sauce which was very pleasantly peachy. My sides were tasty, the sweet potato fries were crispy and the cornbread was good. No complaints really, service was very friendly as well. I can't wait to come back for more burnt ends and to try their other items.UPDATE: Went back and had the special Sunday pork belly, more burnt ends, catfish, and coleslaw. Would absolutely recommend the pork belly if you're there on a Sunday, and the coleslaw was excellent! Catfish was good, and burnt ends were also still delish, even though they were a little inconsistent across the table. Some people's weren't as fatty as mine, but still a good trip to Black Dog. Will be back.",

In order to facilitate easy understanding of my opinions, please note that the Rating is in relation to the quality of the food itself while the other categories will be rated below. Service: 3.5 - depending on the crowd one can either get their food fairly quickly or 40 minutes later; I am a huge fan of the BBQ here but a couple of weeks ago, with a large crowd, I had to wait at least 40 mins for my Catifsh sandwich. Decor: 3 - nothing to write home about but they do have 2 large flatscreens always showing sports so its nice to sit at the bar with a good beer and food in order to enhance one's viewing experience. Food: 5 - It is hands down, the best BBQ in the area. The quality per price ratio is also top notch since the larger helpings will usually tide people over for leftovers as well as fill those who are ravenous. The beer here is really good and reflective of the overall abundance of good microbrews and international beers available in the Champaign-Urbana area. My favorites here are the burnt ends, beef brisket, ribs, catfish, pit beans and the mac cheese special side on Thursdays.",

The sauces were \"OK\", but I could see myself learning to like them more. I didn't notice much dry rub, but it's a good sign when ribs aren't drowned in sauce. I liked their french fries a lot and my wife loved the twice baked potato casserole. Can't comment on the drink selection or bar. Overall it's a tight space and has a hip vibe, being in a university town you expect that usually. The bartender with the TIGHT fro (respect) was energized and really brought an upbeat vibe to the post lunch hour rush. Overall Black Dog was really good, bordering on great, for Illinois BBQ places, and I've been to a lot. We'll be back soon...",

While no where near the quality of TX brisket or even Smoque in Chicago, they were still better than anything you'll find at most locations outside of TX. Pork was a bit bland but still good especially with their sauces.   Ribs were a bit tough, needed just a bit more time on the smoker but overall pretty good.   They had an unusual spice that I couldn't quite place though.  I haven't tried the burnt ends yet, found out they serve them at 11am and 5pm and run out in about an hour.  I hear these are their best bbq item will be back to try them. We also tried their chips and salsa they were great,  it had good kick (which was kind of a bad thing since the waitress sucked at refilling drinks)  my only complaint is that it was billed as smokey salsa and I could not detect any smoke to the salsa.  Sides I've tried Pinto beans - mediocreSmoked sweet potato - ok but not great.  corn bread - goodFrench fries - goodA couple more comments - this place is a small restaurant\\bar.  Due to the size it stays packed and forces a long wait. (you have to sign your name and can be seated at a table or the bar)  We waited an hour each time.   If it wasn't for the scarcity of quality bbq this place wouldn't be worth the wait.  (In central TX this place would get 2 stars)Since it is geared more as a restaurant you don't get to talk directly to the meat cutter, the waitstaff wasn't knowledgeable enough about barbecue to relay my wants to the cutter.    So last time when I ordered my brisket \"moist with extra bark\" it came out lean with very little bark.  One of the kitchen staff \"Kyle\" was awesome and provided great service, when there was a mistake on our order.  He mentioned they are working on opening a larger joint this fall hopefully it will cut down on the wait while not affecting the quality of food.",

I wanted to try two sides so I got the platter. I had the slaw and the potato salad, both of which were awesome.  The pulled pork was delicious, and the sauce they give you was beyond good. I also tried a bite of my friend's cuban sandwich, and it was also delicious. The service was also decent, and the restaurant is pretty nice overall. The only thing I can see being a problem is the size of it. It is definitely a small place and apparently they get a pretty long line at certain times. We went on a Wednesday afternoon and got a table right away though. Can't wait to go back and try everything else on the menu!BASICALLY JUST GO. GO NOW.",

Keep in mind, there isn't a lot of room to stand indoors and wait for tables. It's a pretty small place, but the wait is WORTH it!We started with the burnt ends. If you don't go early, you won't get them. They run out quickly (there's only so many of them since they come off the brisket). They melt in your mouth. They are ridiculously delicious. We also split the smoked wings. The sauce they put on them seems to be a spiced up version of their Carolina Red sauce. They were awesome.For entrees we had quite a mix. The salmon was great. I even tried the beet salad with goat cheese. Not a normal menu item. I should say that I can't stand beets normally. These were good and I kept sneaking bites of my husband's! The brisket was perfect as was the smoked Polish. My dad loved his catfish, too. What really made the meal was our server Matthis (spelling? Sorry if it's wrong). He was funny, friendly and fast. Our drinks were never empty and he seemed to really care that we were happy. I wish it wasn't always so busy. I guess it's because the food is so delicious. Like I said though, it's worth the wait. Thanks to everyone there for a great lunch!",

Come with a friend and you can get seated at the bar, even at peak time, without having to wait too long. Come with more than one friend and you'll have to wait, but DEAL WITH IT DAWG. Patience is a virtue, and pulled pork BBQ with Hot Georgia Peach will be in you soon.",

The cornbread is great and had pieces of pulled pork in it.

Love getting a flight of sauces and working my way through them between dinner and the excellent sides. I highly recommend the sweet potato fries and, if it's summer, the smoked sweet corn. Yum! As most everyone else has said, the meats are also delicious -- according to my husband and the tons of people we've brought here for lunch or dinner.Their tap list is relatively small -- they usually have somewhere around 7 beers at a time -- but there's always lovely choices. Recently, there's been some absolutely delicious dark pumpkin / apple fall beers! Bar and food service sometimes seems rushed, but surprisingly good for how busy they get.This place is insanely busy at pretty much all hours (30-min wait at 8.30pm on a Wednesday?), but it has still become our default for out-of-town guests.

                "review": "Simply put, Black Dog has excellent barbecue. I have yet to try something from the menu that I don't like, and I've actually been pleasantly surprised each time I've tried something new. I usually go for the pulled chicken sandwich (with locally raised, free-range chicken) with Georgia Peach BBQ sauce, and a side of sweet potato fries or pit beans. The chicken has always been incredibly moist, and the peach BBQ is a perfect compliment. Absolutely delicious. I've also tried the brisket, pork tacos, and burnt ends, which were amazing. The sides have also all been delicious, from the corn bread to the spicy potato salad.In addition to the food, the selection of beer on tap is typically pretty varied and affordable. I almost always get a beer with my meal...well, when I'm not feeling too cheap, that is. ;)The only thing that hasn't been consistently good is the service. Don't get me wrong, it's never been bad, per se. They've always been very friendly, but the waitstaff gets easily overwhelmed. So, if it's busy (which it will be around lunch time and early evening), just be patient and don't be afraid to get someone's attention if you feel you're not being noticed.If you love barbeque and supporting awesome local businesses, you should definitely give Black Dog a go.",

Once you enter into the tiny grunge-designed restaurant, the smokey smell of meats will serve as an early indication that you've come to the right place. The only issue with Black Dog is the wait. It's such a tiny place that if you go there at most times of the day, you will have to wait a good deal for your table. I had to sometimes resort to ordering out; however, when you're not in too much of a hurry, the ambience will convince you to stick around.",

It's a close 2 or 3 in my BBQ book (OK Joe's being number 1). For just being in a college town, I wish this restaurant got more publicity because their recipe is ROCK solid. I miss it every time I'm thinking of visiting my Alma Mater.Their ribs and burnt ends are my favorite. I like my meat fatty, and these meats are marbled well, and smoked well. The corn bread is also phenomenal. It's pretty big (I usually split with one other person). Lastly the sauce: everyone I've tried is true to its name. Try Carolina Red for a kick or Georgia Peach for some sweet sauce.",

So we decided to call Black Dog to see how long the wait is, when we heard it was only 10-15 mins wait, we wasted no time. We put our name down and still had to wait like 20-30 mins. We had 6 people so it was harder. They eventually squeezed the 6 of us in a booth. Burnt ends was amazing! It was so perfect. mmm! Ribs was also delicious. The meat came off the bone perfectly. Twice baked potato casserole tasted more like mashed potato. I didn't think it was very special. Beans were surprisingly good! I usually hate all types of beans, but I found myself trying more than 1 bite of my friend's dish. The only thing that I was MEH about was the sauce. I thought Georgia Peach was a bit too sweet, but the meat is already seasoned, so I didn't even eat it with the sauce.We saw the owner working and he even talked to us about the food. He's such a chill guy and I can tell that he loves his job.",

I've also done a carry-out with several other people which only took about 25 minutes to prepare.There's a variety of BBQ sauces from mild to hot listed and detailed on the menu. My personal favorite is the Texas Sauce; it has that smoky flavor I expect out of Midwestern Barbeque. Also, you haven't really lived until you've tried the brisket sandwich.As for side dishes, my friends and I swear by the Twice Baked Potato Casserole. The sweet potato fries are irresistibly sweet and caramelized. Overall, Black Dog provides a one of a kind cuisine. Also VEGETARIANS-- there are some delicious options for you, too.",

The food here is fantastic and I recommend waiting out the long line to eat. It's well worth it. I highly recommend the Texas caviar as an appetizer. If I didn't care about my waistline I would order it every time. The burnt ends are good - there's a reason they sell out like crazy - but I don't think they're the best value for your money. I usually get the hot polish and brisket with the twice baked potato casserole and baked beans. The fries are also great, but I LOVE the potato casserole. You're missing out if you don't get it. My boyfriend loves the rib tips. I think they're the best value for your money, but I get annoyed putting that much effort into eating ;-)The sweet tea isn't great. I wouldn't order it if you're looking for legit sweet tea. The Carolina red sauce is my favorite. Black Dog switched their default sauce from that to the Lexington something other. Not sure why because I think the new default sauce isn't great at all. The Georgia peach is also good, but of you don't like sweet sauce stick with the Carolina. I will definitely miss Black Dog after leaving Champaign.",

I am not a barbecue aficionado, but this was definitely the best place I have ever been to.  I got a pulled pork sandwich, since I had read so much about it, and was definitely not disappointed (I was pleasantly surprised at the fact it was served with slaw on top).  My girlfriend got a brisket sandwich, which was very good, though I preferred my sandwich.  In addition, we got sweet potato fries, which were delicious.They had a fairly extensive drink menu for a restaurant, though not quite as large as a few of the other establishments in the Champaign/Urbana area.  Their draft beer selection was good, and they had a good selection of bottled beer.  In addition to this, the service was both prompt and pleasant, and when I ordered a bottle of Lone Star after having Dogfish Head, the waitress (thankfully) talked me out of downgrading like that (I was... unfamiliar... with Lone Star, I guess it is like Budweiser).Overall, I was very satisfied with this restaurant, and I plan on going again soon (though I have to pick a time when I'm not terribly hungry, due to the wait).",

That was a definite mistake and I wish I had gone here sooner!  Everything I've tried here has been excellent.  Even the sweet potato fries, which I usually don't like, were awesome.  The service was prompt and friendly.  The prices are pretty darn amazing ($6 for a sandwich and side?  Awesome).  And they have fresh squeezed lemonade, free refills.  My first time here was with my mom and stepdad, and they loved it.  My stepdad hates pretty much every restaurant we go to, and his most frequently said phrase after dinner is \"4/10.\"  Black Dog got an \"Eh, I'd come back here,\" which is a ringing endorsement from him.In addition they have a nice selection of beers on draft at all times.  The first time I went here, my boyfriend got the sampler and it had 4 pale ales, which I was a little disappointed in (though they were pretty good).  However, they rotate in 6 new beers every week or so (I'm guessing) so it's worth coming back frequently.  I was there just the other day and got a Left Hand Milk Stout, which happens to be one of my favorites.  So smooth, so good.",

I am originally from L.A and an almuni of the U of I, and in my 4 years in the area, this place consistently serves up the best meals. Whenever I go back down to school, I always make sure I go to Black Dog.Logistics: They won't seat you until your full party is there, and make sure you arrive on the earlier side of whatever meal you plan on going to (5,5:30pm is a good bet for dinner, 11am or so for lunch). The waiting area inside is very small, but there is a nice size bar and tvs.Food: Everything i've ever had from here is great. A go-to is always the combos, and obviously the BURNT ENDS have to be part of whatever creation you make. The ribs, pulled pork, brisket, rib tips, and all of the sandwiches and specials i've tried are delicious. There are some excellent sauces- Hot Georgia Peach and Carlina Red are my 2 favorites. As for sides, the thing to order is baked potato casserole- that alone might be the single best dish on my plate. They have specials all of the time and new dishes that are creative and unique.Beer: Always some local, midwest brews on tap, and they change it up very frequently. The beers they offer are seasonal, the the fall/winter beers are particularly tasty. A great place to get a great meal, some good beers, and watch some games.Service: The service is as good as the food, which is remarkable considering how busy the place gets. There always seems to be 2 waiters around which doesn't seem like much and really isn't- and they do run around, but the service is always fast, pleasant, and attentive. You never feel rushed, the waiters never seem to be too stressed, and they really do a great job.",

I haven't had anything that wasn't good there, so you really can't go wrong.  Beer selection is excellent as well, which is a nice bonus.That said, the quality is a little variable.  Some nights it's just good but then other nights it's drop dead amazing.  On top of that, it's impossible on virtually any night of the week so get there early (5:30 or so) or expect to wait a long time.  It's still worth it and you can't begrudge them their success, they deserve.Always ask if they still have burnt ends... and I vastly prefer their hot Georgia Peach sauce to the standard sauce.",

We did crammed back in a corner but that was ok, we thought. I was excited when I looked at their menu because they had burnt ends. This is a special extra smoked point of the brisket. They smoke the whole thing 12 hours, trim the point, then dry rub the point and resmoke it 12 hours. This cut was in very limited supply so I wanted to get there early. Luckily we got there in time. I ordered the burnt end sandwich which was topped with vinegar based cole slaw with some purple cabbage in there and their signature vinegar red barbecue    sauce. Smoky, spicy, and tart. As my side I choose the sweet potato fries, which were highly recommended here on yelp. The fries were nice and crisp but seemed like I got the end of a batch because they were all small, short fries. Another great thing about The Black Dog is it has a tremendous beer selection. I had an Avery Maharaja Imperial IPA. Extremely hopped and sitting nice at 10%. The food was great but what have them a 3 star rating was when the air kicked on. Once this happened, dust was flying every where. It was all over my shirt and the table. I am sure I ate some but I could not give up this fine meal. Seems as if a spring cleaning was in order. I would go back to Urbana just to try this again. Next time I hope to give it 5 stars.",

Their smoked turkey is amazing - which surprised me because I hate turkey but had to try it when I was drooling over someone else's meal. I've tried most proteins on the menu and sandwiches - I've never been let down. Only once have a thought the meat was a little skimpy, but it's not like I left hungry.

The first trip I had the full slab of ribs while my wife tried the brisket.  Both were absolutely delicious.  We even tried the full flight of sauce's and enjoyed them all.  My wife adores the sweet potato fries.On our second trip, I had to try the pork belly sandwich...in fact, we both did.  UNREAL.  It is unbelievably tender, and the addition of their red cabbage slaw on the bun is a real nice addition.  As for the beer, try the Sawtooth Ale.  A very nice compliment to their BBQ.  I now have a favorite new restaurant in Urbana.  My only complaint, like others before me, is the size of the restaurant.  I don't know that the owners knew their little eatery would be as overwhelmingly successful as it has become, because it can be quite difficult to get a seat.  Their aren't many booths and/or tables in addition to the bar seating.  We arrived at 4pm on a Saturday afternoon thinking it would be dead and still had to wait.  Might be time to either add or move to a new location.  In closing, I cannot recommend Black Dog enough.  Just delicious, home cooked BBQ in the cornfields.  Can't wait to try the \"Burnt Ends\" that everyone is raving about.",

Wasn't too long of a wait for me, only about 2 couples ahead of me and the gf. Got seated at the bar and had an unfriendly waitress. She just seemed stressed and unhappy. Heard her say to another table that it was a long day, so tried not to bother her with anything. I waited until she left and asked another waitress for a different bbq sauce with my meal ha. Anyway, I ordered the rib tips since they guy next to me got it and it looked delicious. It was alright, nothing crazy. I got one of the vinegar bbq sauces first and didn't like it at all. That's when I got the Georgia one which was a lot better and thicker. The twice baked potato casserole, I think it was called, was delicious. The potato salad was meh, you could probably skip on that. The gf got the chicken salad which came with a bunch of crackers. It was a different style on chicken salad so not really sure what to compare it too. It was alright though. We also split some corn bread and that was meh too. I think it was over hyped in my mind from some of these other reviews. Over all it was alright, wasn't too expensive either and you get a pretty decent amount of food. Had to take some home since there was so much so that's always a positive. One day I'll try those burnt ends....one day....",

It's very worth it. So you walk up to free outside of this place and you can already smell the bbq smokey goodness. It only gets better from here. If you can get lucky enough to wait inside during a hot summer day... You're already doing pretty well. So you finally have a table. Grab a menu and order the burnt ends sandwich... I've never had anything like this before. I've had a lot of bbq coming from the south and living here the majority of my life. But the beef brisket here is amazing. It's more tender than any other beef brisket... drool... order it with the Carolina Red sauce. So good. Soooo good. The sweet potato fries are also good too. Corn bread... mmmm. The only thing that I could have done without is the slaw. Meh... I've had much better slaw, but in the sandwich is good. It compliments the rest of the flavors. Can we get back to that beef brisket?

I'm always worried that places with lots of sauces and sandwiches aren't conscious about my gluten free needs but I eat here regularly and haven't had any problems.  The fries are NOT safe for fellow Celiacs, and neither is the corn bread (which I hear is fabulous). I do always make sure to tell them that I have a \"gluten allergy\" and require special attention.  All of the sauces are gluten free as are all of the meats! People don't really rave about the ribs because they are dry rubbed and not fall off the bone but they are yummy.  The brisket and pulled pork are my go-to favs.  The burnt ends, when you can get them, are delicious but people either really love them or really dislike them.  As for sides, the pit beans, apple sauce and potato casserole are all great compliments to their BBQ.  They offer GF beer along with some delicious mixed drinks too!The wait at the restaurant is generally pretty long (especially during peak times) but you can call in and take out which is generally what we do.  Definitely one of my local favorites!",

It's alright, I thought the flavor would be more apparent but it was just okay.It can take the LONGEST time to get a seat but that's okay.

I'm not a BBQ fan for the most part but the flavor in the \"burnt ends\" sandwich was indescribable. As I sit here finishing my Green Flash IPA I'm tempted to order again. I walked in here at 1115a thinking I'd be the only one here only to find I got the last seat at the bar. Soon after I looked over my right shoulder and there's an ever growing mob of people that looked starved and impatient. Not much seating and peeling paint worn out checkered floors give this place a certain feeling like you found something off the beaten path that's special to you and you can't wait to tell your tribe about it. I see one award dangling crookedly dead center of the bar that's partially covered by liquor bottles that reads \"Best of CU ... WINNER\" but the wall should be covered in awards for the succulent deliciousness.  If you're here, you need to eat here.",

You lucky UIUC kids, I'm jealous!Last September, I went to Black Dog for the first time on a double date. We had a 40-minute wait but time flew by in their awesome draft beer selection. They ran out of the famous burnt ends (meat cut from the point half of a smoked brisket) by the time we sat down, but everything else was delicious so I promised myself to go back. And I did, 3 times! It has become a tradition for my boyfriend and me. The quality of their food and beer is amazingly consistent.The burnt ends turned out to be perfectly charred, moist and smokey. On top of that, their hot polish and chicken are just mind blowing. I never pick chicken over beef/pork at bbq places, until I reached my fork into my friend's Black Dog chicken platter :P But tonight, we got another surprise...Smoke Duck Special, which has now made Thursday night the best night! Both the duck and the chicken are worth trying. They not too greasy and deliciously spiced.Last but not least, I have fallen in love with their sides and bbq sauces. You can't go wrong with the sweet potato fries and the vinegar based slaw, also, the cornbread has BRISKET in it! I know the bbq sauce variety does not help your decision making. If you like something with a little \"zing\" or \"kick\", I suggest the Hot Georgia Peach and the mustard.",

Service was friendly, cheerful, and prompt; we each tried some sample beer sips and then got a draught. Everything on the menu sounded delicious but we were just looking for some light bites and then some beer samples. I enjoyed the 1/3 rack of ribs appetizer with a garden salad on the side and my colleague had the same salad with the rib ends. The smoky flavor was incredible and their sauce selection was top notch. I tried both the mild Georgia Peach and the more spicy Carolina vinegar sauce while my colleague tried the hot Georgia Peach. The barbecue was a dry rub - which isn't my favorite - but I have to say the meat was super juicy and tender. If we were in town for longer than one night I would absolutely go back. The barbacks seem to be almost over-staffed and very helpful and conversational to us travelers. Two thumbs up! Bonus: there's a parking lot right next door, so we didn't have to consider street parking.",

Obligatory praise due for the burnt ends (smokier, juicier cap of the brisket, with a crispy, burnt edge), pulled pork, and brisket. Of course, that's leaving out any one of the awesome burgers, the half chicken,ribs, and their awesome sides (pit beans or sweet potato fries for me...but regular fries, southwestern potato salad, twice baked casserole, and smoked sweet potato w/ brown sugar and butter...all ridiculously awesome).The red cabbage cole slaw, and any number of their homemade sauces (my favorite being the hot georgia peach) are outstanding compliments to the meat. and they're conscientious too. a few small price hikes to support grass fed, local beef, and the delightful free-range chicken. they even recycle, which I assure you most of the restaurants in town do not. Oh, and don't glaze over when you hear the specials. Burritos for lunch are insane, and don't get me started on the beef ribs. Slightly more labor intensive than the pork ribs (at risk of being redundant, also excellent), but a serious treat. Almost forgot to mention their amazing beverage selection. Not only is their beer selection fantastic (with the option for an affordable flight of craft beers), they have 1) an awesome whiskey selection 2) awesome bottled soft drinks...mexican coke and squirt (with sugar, not corn syrup), and a couple other tasty options. Alright, this post is getting annoyingly long. But this place is just too good. They deliver you an amazing product while being environmentally conscientious, and just overall nice guys. Lastly, I also might clarify a couple things that people have commented on, but are inaccurate.The platter vs. the sandwichplatter is twice the meat of a sandwich (in the case of brisket, pork, or ends), with two sides, and no bun. so it's not \"basically the same thing,\" it's twice as much of everything, without a bun.the beans don't come out of a microwave, they are smoked and then kept in a hotbox, which is very much not a microwave. plastic might still melt, but it didn't happen in a microwave. That is all.",

I spent three years in Texas where I became a real lover of all things barbecue. Black Dog knocked my socks off.We started with chicken wings. They arrived too hot to touch and glazed in the house standard Carolina BBQ sauce. They were great. Then we shared two combination platters which included brisket, sausage, pulled pork, ribs, twice baked potatoes, slaw, pit beans and sweet potato fries. We had a flight of BBQ sauces which included Carolina, Texas Georgia peach hot and mild, chipotle, Milo's mustard and a vinegar. Get the flight. The diversity of the sauces is half the fun.Keep in mind that you are in a college town and the atmosphere is busy, bustling and full of college kids. I enjoyed it, and actually prefer it over a faux-texan theme with a bunch of cowboy junk on the walls.Great beer selection also. I'll be back next time I'm in Urbana.",

I would recommend the the corn bread (it has bits of BBQ pork in it) to start, the chicken sandwich for an entree (its free range and you can tell the difference) and whatever beer is on the \"nitro tap\" (it makes the beer really creamy).THE BAD: customer service is very poor. in order to be seated all of your party must be present. I was hassled because 5 out of 6 of us where there. I understand if 1 person is holding a table down for 6 but 5/6? C'mon. Also, servers have been cold, short, and gruff with my tables. On the whole, the staff comes off very pretentious.HOW TO FIX: right now you are walk in, consider a reservation system; expand your seating area/kitchen to accommodate more customers; ask your staff to be friendly (not many of them smile, honestly!) and understanding (especially in situations like the ones I described); try and give off the vibe that you appreciate our town in which you have been so successful.STAY or GO: I wouldn't pick Black Dog for a meal but I would go if someone else wanted to.",

We ordered sandwiches, all of which were uniformly excellent (a pulled-pork sandwich, a brisket sandwich and a pulled chicken sandwich).

And, one small dressing.  Oh yes, and the tomatoes. . . they brag about locally sourced lettuce, but then put on roma tomatoes with no flavor and obviously from a large food service company.  The local tomatoes now are so awesome--if you're so plugged into local, why not use them?  Also, every time I come here the service is indifferent at best.  I also feel like they don't want me there. LIke I owe them something since they are so popular.  I hope the other BBQ places start using more sustainable meat, and I will go there instead of this place, where I have to wait an hour no matter what time of the day to have the honor of them serving me!",

We both had the house sauce, which was good but I will probably try something a bit milder next time.  The staff was VERY friendly.

We were expecting 5 people to show for dinner and so I signed the paper at the front for 5.  When one didn't show up the waitress informed me that everyone needed to be present in order to be seated and that nobody could join your table at a later time.  On to the food:  I had the beef brisket platter with corn bread and their beans.  Both sides were absolutely amazing.  I tried a little of my sister's potato salad...I think and it was great as well.  As far as the brisket goes, I kind of expected it to be seasoned better.  It was very tender and perfectly cooked but I thought it would have seasoning aside from the BBQ sauce served in a separate dipping cup.  All things considered I give the food as a whole 4.5 stars, the service gets 3.5 stars because the waitress seemed a bit short when she stated the seating policy.  True there was a sign at the front, but I didn't see it because the place was crowded.  Maybe put multiple signs up.  Please hurry and get your second location going!",

I sampled the Carolina vinegar sauce, but my favorite was combining the Georgia peach and Texas sauces on the brisket. We liked the Pit beans and the corn muffin was amazing with a smokey bacon flavor. The slaw was ok. The food order came quickly, and the portions were generous, too.

It has pork and whole bunch of other stuff in it that make it extra special.  The prices are unbeatable too.  Dinner for two, I'd be shocked if you spent more than $30 total with drinks.  I've heard the wait can be bad, but I was there on a Saturday night at 7pm and only waited maybe 10 minutes.  It was so good though I would wait much longer!Highly recommended!",

If you mind the wait, go for lunch on weekdays or choose odd hours, when most people don't have their lunch or dinner. Most of their food is really good. I particularly like the pork belly sandwich and the rib tips.",

Well was I ever wrong!  The menu offers quite a few items for non meat eaters, a smoked catfish, salmon (on Friday and Saturday) a falafel  plate AND a grilled cheese!  My son and husband started off with wings and then moved on to the burnt end sandwiches, one choosing potato salad the other choosing fries and i had the smoked catfish.  Always health conscious I had to ensure that the items were not fried and the extremely friendly and helpful waitress assured me, no they were only smoked.  All I can say is WE ARE CONVERTS!!!!  No other barbeque places for us anymore.  My husband and son agreed that 10 out of 10 times they would get the burnt ends sandwich(one note to others-this does run out).  As for my catfish?  Delicious, mouth watering, healthy and left me wanting to come back often-thanks Black Dog for offering outstanding BBQ for us all!!!!!",

Black Dog is a family owned restaurant & recently opened their new location. I personally have worked with the owner's wife, Kim, and she is delightful. Really good family with good work ethic and super friendly. I had to work Black Friday at the local mall and wasn't able to go home for Thanksgiving dinner, so I was invited to have dinner at Black Dog with Kim, her family, and other co-workers. I was not disappointed! I even saw the smokers they use to smoke the meat! Pretty cool. When you enter you have to sign a giant list and the hostess calls up whoever is next and crosses them off. Super cute idea and very unique. Makes the (long) wait go by quickly. Definitely stop by if you are ever in the area, even if you don't like smoked food or BBQ, they will have something you can try... (twice baked potato casserole) ;)",

I could not finish a full rack. The fries were on par with any other sweet potato fries I've had anywhere, but the portion size was relatively small and the fries themselves were on the cool side like they'd been cooked and reheated. The slaw was not to my liking. The cabbage was cut too thick, chewy and bitter.  And while the sauce was a pretty tasty vinegar base, it did nothing to transform the cabbage. The sauce just ran to the bottom of the bowl. I would definitely recommend this place if just for the ribs. Our party of 4 waited about an hour to get in, but the servers were attentive and good at handling large crowds.  I would have given Black Dog 5 stars if the slaw and fries were better.  Overall, I love the feel of the place and appreciate a small business that does things well.",

I had never been to Black Dog when I lived in town, but on a recent visit some good friends told me it was THE place to go. We arrived around lunch time and we expected to wait for a table. The restaurant sits MAYBE 30 people, and this is a good thing. We only had to wait about 15 minutes, which given the number of people and the small seating area, I thought was pertty good.Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and made great suggestions. I ended up ordering brisket and pulled pork. Both were delicious. The smoke ring on the brisket was a beautiful color and all the flavor was there. The house BBQ sauce which came with the meal was EXCELLENT and though I have heard that they have several other options, I'm not sure there would ever be any need.Another bonus was that Black Dog had a small, but great, beer selection. They had 7 beers on draft, all of which were really good. They offered a sampler of 4 oz. pours, which was a great thing to enjoy with my meal.  It was a LITTLE nerdy that the beers were served in a \"dog bone\" shaped serving platter, but I suppose it was fun.Overall, I had a great experience at Black Dog and I would love to return on my next visit.",

My coworkers had told me about this place and everyone had ranting about how amazing it was.  Given that I love good barbecue, I knew I had to check it out, so when a buddy of mine got dumped by his fiancee, I knew exactly what he needed--beer and barbecue from Black Dog.The first time I went, I had a pulled-pork sandwich with fries and a beer.  I had the standard red sauce, which was tangy and delicious.  The pork was juicy and flavorful.  The bun was large and tasty.  They put coleslaw on their pulled pork sandwiches, which I probably would have asked them not to put on it had I known, but I decided to give it a shot since it came that way, and I was pleasantly surprised at how it added to the experience.  The fries were good steak fries--fairly standard fare for such a place.  It's hard to mess up fries.The second time I went was with a large group of people (~12), which given the size of the place, proved to be a bit of a chore.  Part of the group had to sit in a booth, while the rest occupied the high tables.I ordered a full rack of ribs with potato salad and sweet potato fries on the side.  Sweet potato fries are always great, but because of the sugar content seldom reach a decent level of crispiness.  These were adequately crispy and very flavorful and had brown sugar on them, adding a nice touch.  The potato salad had something spicy in it, which gave it a nice, unique kick.  The ribs were fantastic, and having been there, I really wouldn't recommend anywhere else in town for ribs.  They had clearly been cooked a long time and seemingly without boiling.  The edges were crispy and flavorful and the insides were tender and juicy.  I ordered the same sauce I had ordered the first time I visited, which once again, was tangy, sweet, and delicious.The atmosphere was good--pretty laid back, somewhat cozy and down-to-earth while still maintaining a sense of rustic class.  The layout prevents the gathering of particularly large groups, which is not surprising for a place that size.  It was worth splitting the group a bit to go there.",

Then it was a choice between the ribs, half chicken, catfish, and pulled pork (pulled pork !!!).  I had to get the ribs, which were dry rubbed, smoked, and came with the perfect vinegar-y sauce.  The sides are just as delicious, one of my friends fell so in love with his baked beans that he's been talking about them for the past two days.

Brisket was awesome. The vinaigrette they make for the salads is super. And they had a great beer menu.We loved it and will definitely be making an excuse to do the 2.5 hour drive again!The only thing we wouldn't get again was the cornbread because it was very salty.

I know what you're thinking: you ordered meatloaf?!? Well the meatloaf was delicious compared to the combo plate (I won) which I find satisfying and disappointing at the same time. The BBQ was supposed to be amazing here but I thought it was dry. They provided sauces and whatnot but really good BBQ doesn't need anything extra. Also I thought it was funny that the combo plate was more expensive than the meatloaf and I got this huge thing plus sides whereas my friend got these small samples of meat. If I remember correctly, they brew their own beer in the back (or have stuff on tap) which was really good. All in all, this place has too much hype because it's good but not to die for like everyone says.",

We had fantastic BBQ & service! Since there was a 45 minute wait when we arrived and my grandparents are over 90, the host told us we should walk over to the bar across the street for drinks and he came all the way over there to let us know our table was ready!! Now THAT's service!    Also, I'm from GA and the BBQ here is better than most I've had back home, and that's sayin somethin!",

The brisket was perfectly tender and moist. The pulled pork was light (not greasy). The waiter was light hearted and made the evening even more enjoyable. The crowd was having a good time.I especially liked that they offered samples when deciding between two unknown beers. Hope to get the opportunity to eat here again.",

The sauce is tangy with a bit of a kick, not a sweet bbq sauce.  They usually don't put enough on in my opinion, so ask for extra.  The ribs have a dry rub that make a nice crust and the meat inside is extremely tender and juicy.  Their twice baked potato casserole is delish, but I think the sweet potato fries need a lot more seasoning.  The cornbread is different, a little smokey and actually has bits of pork in it, but it was great.  The only reasons I don't give them 5 stars are 1) they are usually out of at least one thing (maybe that's part of the allure??) 2) it's really small and crowded all the time and 3) I've found the service to be rude. They make me feel like it's a hassle for them to bring me my food and take my money.  Oh well, the food makes it worth it!",

By the time we did get seated they had run out of: brisket, burnt tips, smoked catfish, smoked chex mix and their potato casserole which included a couple things that I had wanted to try. I ended up going with the two meat platter and got bacon meat loaf and fried cat fish while one of my friends got pulled pork and ribs. The ribs and meat loaf were pretty good, but the pulled pork was a little dry and the fried cat fish was just average as well. I would say all the sides are pretty delicious and I had a try at the cornbread, potato salad, slaw, and beans. The corn bread is outstanding with bits of meat in it and the potato salad was pretty good as well. You get to choose hot sauces to go with your meal and I would definitely recommend the Georgia peach! I will have to try this place again to see how the brisket, burnt tips, and smoked cat fish are!",

Go here only if you are willing to sacrifice a little convenience in order to gorge yourself on some of the best food in town.   There doesn't seem to be a weak spot on the Black Dog's menu.  As other people have mentioned, the pulled pork is exceptional, but right now I'm hung up on the free-range Amish chicken.  Whether you get it as a breast or as a thigh and a wing, you won't be disappointed.  It is moist, succulent, and pairs well with their homemade sauce.        In my experience, the service is pretty good given the circumstances.  Yes, you will have to wait fifteen minutes to a half hour to get a seat, but eventually your turn will come.  Moreover, since it's a barbecue joint, it doesn't take too long for your food to come after that.  The restaurant would probably benefit from an expansion or a move to a larger location, but for food this good, I'm willing to brave a short wait for the time being.",

It's too bad because the food is good, although not the sublime experience that some people claim.  Yes, the burnt ends are delicious -- if you can ever get them.  Forget about seating.  Forget about customer service. Get take out, if you can find someone who will condescend to wait on you.

One visit, they had pozole, which was pretty damn good.  The sweet potato fries are a must, but every other side I've tried is amazing, too: pit beans, regular fries, baked potato casserole, and on and on.It's got a very casual vibe that I like, but it's also not so casual that it's trashy.  There's often local abstract art on the walls, but there's also a huge jug of tequila and pineapple on top of the fridge.  So, there's a desirable balance.Since this place now has a rep, lunch and dinner times are sometimes kind of crazy.  If you can hit it around 3 p.m. during the week, you usually won't have to wait for a table.The prices are fair, as long as you don't go too nuts with the beer.",

I would definitely go for the burnt ends, but they sell like hot cakes, so make sure you get there early or order ahead of time.I was interviewing the owner and staff for an article, and everyone was beyond passionate about their food. As I was taken back to see the smoking rack, I was happy to see the staff joking and laughing with each other. They seemed so at ease and seemed to enjoy their work. From the bartenders to the wait staff to the chefs, everything is bar none here. It shows in the quality of the bbq and the excellent drink recommendations made.I've seen people get the whiskey fleet and be awed by the beautiful presentation. Plus, there's nothing better than a spot of whiskey, burnt ends, pulled pork, mashed potatoes and some sweet potato fries. Better hit the gym afterwards, but you know it'll be worth it.",

The burnt ends are basically legendary. I had never been there early enough to try them until yesterday. Yeah, they're amazing. It's no wonder they sell out before 12:45 pretty much every day. The barbecue is divine, the sauces fiery, the fries crispy, and the beer cold - and all for a terrific price (and friendly service!). Lunch for two with one appetizer, one sandwich, one platter, one soft drink and one beer - $32 before tip, and there were even some leftovers to take home. The only downside I can see, other than the occasional out-of-stock menu item, is the seating issue. There's definitely not enough space. However, they do make it fantastically easy to get a meal to-go, plus some relaxing outdoor seating for the warmer months. If you come with a group, make sure everyone is there on time, or you'll be waiting until the last person arrives, and then some. Still - it's worth the wait.",

We saw people in booths and tables with food and drinks, waited on by a woman, and at least two people standing around behind the bar. They were not busy.Finally tiring of this exercise we seated ourselves at the bar uninvited. The bartender came by and told us they were basically out of food. No ribs, no pulled pork, no chicken, nothing.I can understand their under-estimating demand given that they haven't been open that long. (Although, if you start serving ribs at 5pm, you only have something like 5 booths and 4 tables, and you're out by 8pm -- huh?)But if someone had told us there were out when we came in, it wouldn't be a problem. Letting customers just stand around stupidly is ridiculous. I'm sorry, no food is so good to suffer so much attitude. I felt like I was in a snooty restaurant in Paris.No thanks. We went down the street to Seven Saints and had a nice dinner with friendly service.",

And I really want to give 3.5 stars but since I can't do that, I rounded down mainly because the brisket we got really was dry....and for a BBQ place with that much hype I was really kind of sad inside to get dry brisket...WE REALLY wish we had gotten the burnt ends, but they were sold out by the time we got seated...next time and I am sure that would have caused me to round up instead of down from 3.5 stars...The cornbread with pork in the cornbread, however, is genius! So so good and it added a little more moisture. I definitely need to try making it that way at home. And the pulled pork was also decent especially paired with one of their sweeter BBQ sauces that we got. The catfish was probably my favorite though which is surprising since I don't even normally order fish at a BBQ place, but here I was and I had heard it was good, and it actually was pretty good!The mac and cheese was only okay as well in my obsessiveness over anything with cheese and in particular mac and cheese, but the cornbread and catfish were the winners for me!",

BD has become one of my regular dinner spots, their meals hardly ever disappoint. The only drawback is the waiting, sometimes you stroll right in and get seated, other times, it's an hour wait. The wait staff is very hit or miss, I have a few favorite waiters (yup, guys) and one waitress that I think are helpful, attentive, and funny. What to eat: Appetizers: smoked chicken wings, smoked artichoke dip (AMAZING!) Meats: anything pork (seriously), smoked chicken (I MUST try their brisket)The burgers-allSides: sweet potato fries, French fries, beans, slaw, twice baked potato casseroleDrinks: great selection of beers, wait staff and bartenders tend to give spot on recommendationsIf liquor isn't your thing, they make their own sweet iced tea-yumOk: dinner salad with pulled pork, portabella sandwichMeh: Cuban sandwich -- while it's the best one in town, I was a bit disappointed in its size and it's good, but not excellent. That said, I might give it a second try.Misses: Chicken salad (new) and their very popular corn bread (sorry, it's all of that meat in it, for some reason I just can't like it!)I was just there this past Tuesday and am already planning my return. 4/5 stars because of the long waiting, running out of food quickly (though who can blame the hoards of hungry customers?!), and the hit-or-miss wait staff-I HIGHLY recommend this place the food is excellent, the drinks are good, and the prices are very fair do keep on mind that due to it's popularity lines can be a bit crazy",

Based on the reviews here, I was expecting a long wait, but got lucky and only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table (I'm sure the miserable weather had something to do with that).  I can be a touch critic when it comes to BBQ - having spent years living in the southeast and in Texas, I'm familiar with both BBQ traditions.  Since everything looked so good, I had to get a combination plate.  My ribs were just so-so - I got the small end, and the meat had gotten pretty dried out, and were perhaps a tad over-seasoned.  They did have a decent smoke flavor though, and I imagine that if I had gotten the larger pieces I would have liked them significantly better.  The brisket (my usual favorite) was not particularly good - it was so lean that it had become dry and tough.  However, the burnt ends really stole the show.  In case you aren't familiar, they are chunks of the brisket point (not really \"burnt\", but they spend some extra time in the smoker giving more smoke flavor, and they don't get overly dry because of their higher fat content).  They had great flavor, with an ideal, tender-but-not-too-tender texture. My sides were good - surprisingly good fries (skinny cut with a seasoned surface) and apples (a nice complement to BBQ that doubles as a dessert).  None of the sauces stood out to me, but it was nice that they had a variety.  If you want to try extra, you can get \"half-and-half\" if you ask - smaller portions of two different sauces - otherwise, they do charge extra.  It is a little on the pricey side for BBQ, but given the relative lack of quality options in C-U (and the fact that they're always so busy), I can't fault them for that too much.",

If you tend to go out to restaurants like, say, Chili's or Friday's, where the servers are obligated to be saccharine to the point of nausea, then hey! you probably won't like The Black Dog's atmosphere because you'll think the servers, host or bartenders are rude for not falling all over themselves to do your bidding. I personally love the Black Dog, primarily for the food. If I had one complaint about the place it would be that it gets pretty cramped. Probably once a week I entertain the notion of going to eat here and have to decide against it because of how ridiculously busy it is. I know The Black Dog isn't hurting for business and I might even be doing them a favor by not going to dine with them on their busier evenings, but GOD, I love them so much. Why do you constantly rebuff my advances, Black Dog?The Black Dog is hands down one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. I've loved everything I've tried on the menu thus far.  The portions are always more than enough, and the food is, frankly, under-priced for the amount and quality of food you get. The first time I went I expected to pay $15 an entree and was shocked to find it was far cheaper. Pay this place a visit, even if you have to wait 40 minutes to be seated. Worth it.",

However, after the first bite I can't help but wish I was scraping the bone of a Black Dog rib drizzled ever so sparingly with the Texas BBQ sauce, or savoring another bite of the always delicious potato salad. Mike, Pedro and the crew have truly created something special, a place that transcends the food it serves. Black Dog isn't just a restaurant, it's a state of being, a place that people are eager to take others for their very first time simply to try and relive the joy of their own first experience. Whether I'm salivating over the smokey charred brisket, or jonesing for one of the hand selected craft beers on tap, Black Dog will always maintain a special place in my heart, one that every future smoked meat establishment will fruitlessly attempt to replicate. I will be back to Black Dog one day, but until then I will have my memories of Black Dog stuck like proverbial rib meat between the teeth of my epicurean reveries.",

The pulled pork is a personal favorite, and while I never switch away from the Carolina Red (reminds me of barbecue at home) my friends love the Georgia Peach sauce. The brisket is also good- nice and tender- and the rib tips are fantastic. I don't like cornbread, but theirs is good (plus they bake meat into the bread- always a plus). They've recently slimmed down their beer menu a bit, but it's still very diverse, as is their whiskey menu. There are a lot of bourbons here that you can't order elsewhere in town (including Evan Williams 1783, a personal favorite). The place is too damn small and I wish they'd have burnt ends a bit more often (they're very good). But I can't really complain.",

I had the Carolina Red and Hot Georgia Peach - both were excellent with just the right amount of heat (I like it hot).  French fries were really good - not overcooked or cold.  Overall the meat that I selected was tasty.  I had the pulled pork and burnt ends which were both cooked to my liking.  And the Metropolitan Ironworks beer was pretty good.The bad: The coleslaw was barely edible.  The cabbage was almost completely raw and the sauce was a huge miss.  I don't think it was just me either.  I noticed a few other people who's plates were clean except for the slaw.  The biggest disappointment of my whole visit though were the burnt ends which were almost half fat.  The whole point of a BBQ spot is the meat, so you've got to do this right!  I was expecting a better job on the trimmings considering the prices.  Lastly, the Green Flash beer was underwhelming.  They claim that it's like Bud Light, except that it's not and cost $6.  Make sure you ask for a taste before ordering.Overall it was a decent spot and I Ill will probably try again now that I know what items to avoid.",

On top of everything, the staff are very friendly and the atmosphere is welcoming and laid-back. A must-visit if you are in the area, and worth the wait that you will almost certainly endure (even in the bitter cold of an Illinois winter).One note: they've recently switched their default sauce from the somewhat-spicy Carolina Red to a milder, liquid sauce.

It has pulled pork and pit beans and so good when it's hot.Expect a long way. I suggest going really early or really late.",

The sauce was very good- definitely homemade, not the HFCS stuff from the bottle. It's not as sweet as the thick and dark styles, but its delicious, with a bit of heat. The slaw is is vinegar, not mayo-based and mine was fresh and crisp. The cornbread was delicious- the description says it has chilies, beans, and meat in it, and I was imagining something with big chunks or almost like a baked sandwich- when it arrived it looked like a piece of thick cornbread, but when you bit into it the flavor was salty and smoky with just a hint of chile flavor- no discernible pieces of beans/meat. The potato salad was good, but not the best I've had. The baked beans were delicious, with a definite smokiness, NOT the sweet stuff you're used to from pot lucks or the can!Delicious BBQ!",

We had the burnt tips for an appetizer and I was very impressed with the flavor and the tenderness.  I ordered the brisket with their version of Texas bbq sauce and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Great smoke ring and flavor with a good portion size.  SO ordered the combo plate of a half slab of spareribs and catfish.  The ribs were seasoned well with a sweet dry rub which is how my SO prefers them.  They were cooked to perfection, tender but not overdone and I got a good crisp bite off the bone.  I didn't care for the catfish as it was smoked however the hubby enjoyed it.  I liked the bbq sauces we had (Texas and sweet Georgia peach) however did not  care for the house bbq sauce.  The side dishes are okay.  I had the Southwest potato salad and it was a different take on traditional potato salad. Atmosphere was great and the servers were friendly and knowledgeable.  I do wish they had more room inside the restaurant however I hear they're opening a second location with more square footage.  Definitely pleased and would have this add a go-to spot to take visitors for bbq.",

From the outside you would never think that good food was coming out of the kitchen, but as they say, \"don't judge a book by its cover.\"  We started out with the wing appetizer, they were great. The wings were smoked, and tossed in an amazing sauce, wish their were more on the plate than six. Then I went with the brisket sandwich, it was tender and delicious, for my side was the twice baked potato casserole which I really found to be something special. My wife went with the pulled pork which was superior to any I have found in the area. We also ordered a sampler plate of their sauces, they have seven different sauces varying in sweetness and heat, they are all unique and really nice. Overall the food there that we had was fantastic.     I really wish this place was in a bigger building, it's tiny. We stood in a small mob at the front door waiting to be seated for about 25 minutes. Though it was worth the wait for the great food, I did see many people open the door, see the crowd and leave. We ended up getting stuck at the bar to eat our meal, which wasn't preferable, but beggars can't be choosers.     Overall, I was super pleased with this place because of the awesome food. We will definitely be back.",

I continue to take meat and sauce home to this day when in the area.  If anything, they have created a monster, with waits (sometimes lengthy) at any meal time.  Go off-hours if you can.  I find their burnt ends, pork belly, chicken wing starters, beef brisket, and Carolina and Texas sauces some of the best things I have had at any bbq joint.  Given the crowds, service is good, but it can get hectic.  Not a place to linger and talk unless you get there at an off-time.  This space itself is pleasant with warm colors, and flatscreens have games going all the time.  Probably best bbq between the Chicago area and perhaps Murphysboro (17th St. Bar and Grill), some 5 hours south.  Warning - not sure who owns the parking lot to the north of the building, but it is in AWFUL shape.  Beware.",

She spoke very highly of it and I was so excited to try it!!! I would like to say first and foremost that I have been in the restaurant/bar industry for around 6 years and I know what it is like to work in a busy environment...though there was a wait, it was NOT busy enough to provide THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER.We arrived and the hostess (a gentleman) greeted us with a face of annoyance. I saw an extra chair at the bar and asked if we could pull up an extra one and sit there. With annoyance he answered with \"Not right now.\" We were never told that the bar was also a part of the seating wait. We asked how long the wait was and received yet another look of annoyance stating there were sixteen tables waiting ahead of us with no time frame. I really wanted to try the food so we decided to take it to go. By this time I was upset considering, like i previously mentioned, I work in the industry and know how to give customer service to build rapport. I asked the guy taking our order if the hostess was the owner and he informed me that the hostess wasn't but he in fact was the owner, omitting to ask if there was something he could do for us. I did not mention what horrible service we were receiving because I like to be more professional but while we were waiting for our food we over heard two other customers become disappointed at the responses they were receiving from the hostess. Honestly though the food was good my friend nor I will EVER come back here. Come on dude, step up your game if your gonna be a popular place in a small town. AWFUL SERVICE!!!!",

(I lived in Michigan for awhile, and what they serve is the most heinous excuse for BBQ I've come across. Obviously Illinois ain't BBQ stupid like that state north and east of us on the other side of Lake Michigan.)Damn, has Black Dog has got it going on! We're talkin the real deal KC style burnt ends. The pulled pork is the meatier Georgia style, and better than any I ever had in Tennessee. The mustard based sauce was authentically Carolina. I swear, the Carolina Red was the best sauce I've had outside of Kansas City. The sauce is actually reminiscent of Gates (Hi! May I help you?!) in Kansas City more than any other sauce I've ever had. The pit beans were real pit beans. (Never got anything comparable in Tennessee.) And the burnt ends were moist, smokey, and delicious. Southern transplants, you best git yo asses down there quick, y'all. Hell, all y'all need to git yo asses down there quick, so long as you save me a spot in line. I guarantee you'll slap your momma and ask her why she can't cook like that! Can I give six stars, cause damn, they're worth it! And I haven't even mentioned the draught beer selection!",

That wasn't so good, but everything else was.And sweet Mary and Joseph--CORNBREAD WITH MEAT IN IT.Yes.  UH. MAY. ZING.The wait staff is friendly and personable, and the food is top notch.  My only other complaint would be the lack of fried catfish 6 out of 7 days.  Oh, they have regular catfish, but it's only fried on Fridays.  And that just breaks my heart.  Because I LOVE fried catfishy.  DOn't judge me.Tasty, tasty catfish. Anyhow, Black Dog is worth a stop, they've definitely renovated and improved the former space, and the food is great.",

Gross and waaaaaaaaaaay too much fat. Not the kind of rib tips I'm used to. I think asked for the actual ribs of the pig and they were ok. The rub was not impressive, the meat did not fall off the bones, and the sauce was nothing special. I guess Chicago kicks butt for ribs because Urbana, IL is highly overrated.

Pulled pork & briskets are both good, the burnt tips are the best item but they run out quickly at lunch and dinner.  A few excellent sauces. My fave: hot georgia peach, but the carolina vinegar & mustard are good.  The sides are good:  excellent slaw, good baked beans, & decent potato salad. Great beer selection, better brown liquor selection. As a bonus, they occasionally have neat add ons like smoked ice (turns your bourbon into scotch). The downside: the restaurant selection in CU is so impoverished that Black Dog is always crowded, and I mean crowded as heck (this includes a Thurs at 2pm in late May after the undergrads left). My tip: get takeout.  It's inexpensive (especially because you're saving the cost of alcohol). Just don't get the fries as a side.",

The Texas burger comes with a patty, cheese, brisket, and their famous Texas sauce. For $10, it's a great amount of food, as it also comes with one side. Great burgers, their twice baked potato casserole is a huge hit, best ribs ever, huge fan of the fries, and you can't go wrong with the burnt ends (better go early before they sell out). Service is also always great. Food comes out fast. They got these sick new iPads that each waiter carries with them when it's time to pay - quick, efficient, super hip. Super fan of Black Dog.",

WHAT A SHAME! I have truly missed out. I went there this past weekend after much hype from previous colleagues. The setting is just as you expect it.. always a wait [20-30 mins], very... barbequ-ie. You know, metal trays, easily cleanable, amazing smell, tasty beers, etc.Anyway, I heard so much about the burnt ends I had to get them. They only serve them twice a day. At least, this is what I am told. They have them when they open and they have them in the afternoon/dinner time. But once they run out, you'll have to wait til next time. :-( saddd face. Luckily, They had the burnt ends. Naturally, i ordered them. They were sooooo tender. I can't recall any other meat I've had in my LIFE as tender as these. They literally would fall apart when you picked them up. // Burnt ends - DEFINITELY get these. enough said. // Cornbread appetizer - easily the tastiest cornbread I've ever had. I think they put bacon in it? or some sort of meat. So soft and savory. It was very unique and definitely should be on your check. // Sauce flight - $2 - this is very cool for your first time but I wouldn't get it again. I wanted to try all the sauces but my favorite was the milos mustard. Also the vinegar one is great too. I forgot the name. I would get it your first time to kind of try all the sauces. // Sides - all of our sides were veryyyyy good. the FRENCH FRIES were amazing. They must be friend in pork fat. seriously, I have only had fries like that at one other place and they were fried in pure fat [or so i speculated]. Didn't get to try to sweet potato fries. The mac and cheese was good, a bit on the smaller portion.The only thing i didnt like... was the ribs. They were just a little bit to tough and didn't fall off the bone like i expected. I would opted out of these. But honestly, the burnt ends were so good that it didn't even matter what else I had.If you are every traveling through the champaign-urbana area... STOP AT THIS PLACE.

I ordered the combo: ribs and catfish with the Carolina house sauce on the side.  The plate arrives with small portions and a side of the worst sauce I have ever tasted.  The way the food is cooked must be particular to a certain region because it is not like the Memphis, Kentucky and Texas style I grew up eating.  It was full of vinegar, spicy and nasty.  The meat was tender, which it should be because it was smoked for 4 1/2 hours, and I wouldn't have expected anything less.  After eating here, I wasn't impressed. So many people have talked about how great the food was, and I should have known better.  The food was okay, and I must say I've had better barbecue in my own backyard.",

This is descent BBQ, but I definitely wouldn't say it's amazing or anything. As a matter of fact, their burgers and most side-dishes are absolutely a waste of money! Also, I've tried all of their BBQ sauces and the only one I really liked was the sweet GA peach, the rest are not that good.I was a bit torn on how to rate this restaurant -- they have descent BBQ, I absolutely love the cornbread, but I hate waiting in line, and I find their snooty \"we're the best restaurant in town\" attitude EXTREMELY off-putting!",

Among the choices, one of my favorites is the pulled pork sandwich with their signature sauce.  The pork has plenty of smoky flavor but it is not overwhelming while the sauce has a slight tang and complements the meat well.  I recently tried the pulled chicken sandwich and found it was just as good if not better than the pork.  Outside of main entrees, the sweet potato fries are fantastic as is the corn bread.  One thing to note about the sandwiches is that they all come with cole slaw on top unless you specifically ask otherwise.As others have noted, there is not a lot of seating in the restaurant and if you happen to visit during a busy time you may end up waiting for a while.  Also, given the tight quarters, there isn't much standing room while waiting so things can get cramped rather quickly.  If you want to try Black Dog's food without waiting for a seat, they do offer carry out which is extremely quick.",

I did not really look over the menu because I knew what I wanted before going: the Thursday special, the BBQ burrito. I placed my order and within five minutes my lunch was placed before me. Added into the burrito was pico de gallo, house salsa, cheese, saute'd poblano peppers and smoked turkey. It was an interesting combination; not quite mexican, but not quite pure BBQ. It was filled with flavor. The only issue I had with this dish was how much juice/grease was inside my burrito. It ended up falling apart, but luckily the lunch came prepared with a fork and knife to clean up the scrapes. Based off of this dish, I am sure a pure BBQ dish would be quite delicious, but I am going to reserve a 5 star review until I can try it out. As a summary, the service was nice and quick, I was a fan of the atmosphere, and the food left me wanting more.",

Each of my friends groups loved this place and it's great for takeout so I must have been here over 30 times in two years.  And now that I've moved to a region with crappy BBQ, I dream of Black Dog's brisket and wonder why I moved here. Job, schmob.I've been coming here ever since the first week they opened and they've really come a long way.  The food was always delicious, but they ironed out the kinks and expanded the menu. Everything is delicious.  You really can't go wrong.The ribs, brisket and pulled pork are AMAZING.  The brisket is my favorite, hands down. I've had brisket at other places and it's dry or fatty or lacking in flavor. Not Black Dog. I've never had bad brisket here. I've never had bad ANYTHING here.The sides are just stunning.  I had a recurring problem with underdone smoked sweet potatoes but no one else had this problem. I must be cursed. When they're fully done, they're delicious, just check them before you leave if you get takeout.  The fries and sweet potato fries are crisp and delicious. In about 20 orders, we've never had soggy or greasy fries.  The potato casserole is okay but it's a bit bland.  Their homemade smoked bleu cheese dressing  is also fabulous.  And I'd consider composing an ode to their cornbread.They also did theme nights, where they'd put on special dinners.  There was a night with local meats from Triple S Farms, a beer night, and a Thanksgiving dinner.  All delicious. Notice a theme, here?  I miss you guys!",

The pulled pork is great on its own or in a sandwich, and the pork belly is heaven if your arteries can handle more than one bite :).  Unfortunately, they're very crowded a lot of the time and it can get quite noisy inside.  But with food as good as theirs, I'll keep coming back.  Their house BBQ sauce isn't sickly sweet like some other area establishments', but instead is slightly spicy with a vinegar kick (but if you're with silly folks like my  hubs who like a sweeter sauce, don't worry, they've got that too).  Delightful.  Try the smoked sweet potato after 5pm for a special side, it's one of my favorites (and makes especially good take-home leftovers if you are too full after devouring your meats).  Oh, and if you're like me and were used to mixed drinks that come all tricked out with umbrellas and slushy neon coloring, sit down before you order one of theirs.  Their margaritas are delicious, not at all watered-down, and served in a plain old glass.  Knock your socks off yummy and strong.  Their selection of beer is also excellent.",

When you order you have your choice of sauces and I went with the Texas sauce for the pulled pork and the hot mustard for the sausage. The meats were smoked to perfection and the sauce complimented it nicely. The side dishes of potato casserole and cornbread were probably the best sides I have had in a long time with BBQ.

By looking at the exterior of this place I would have never guessed it to harbor a BBQ-haven within. I arrived in on a rainy early afternoon and was surprised to see still a bit of a crowd. In hindsight, this is probably a sign that the Urbana folk love this place- and warranted.I was promptly seated at the bar and happy to see that they have an EXPANSIVE option of bourbon and rye to choose from; even some high quality stuff like Bookers. Additionally they had a good handful of on-tap options covering a variety of beer types. The bartender wasn't the warm and fuzzytype, however he was very prompt, attentive, and professional. I opted for the combo of two; 1/4 rack of ribs and beef brisket. For sides, corn bread and twice baked mashed potatoes. I'll have to say each were very flavorful with thee own unique taste. These both are definitely someone's home receipe and I approve. The cornbread itself is hearty and flavorful enough to TRUELY qualify as a side.Overall this is a great place without the steep price you generally run accross in a BBQ joint (that's including the bourbons). The quality to price ratio definitely leaves the patron winning in this transaction. Well don't Black Dog.... Well done.",

Their other sides are very good but the sweet potato fries are so amazing its hard to pass them up. The chicken wings are possibly the best in town. All of the sauces are excellent, I highly recommend getting the sample sauce tray.Downside to this place is the wait but if you go early or late you generally only have to wait 15-20 minutes. I also suggest no more people than 4 as it is a very small place. The bar is a great place to sit so don't count it out.The beer selection is excellent and I highly recommend the flight if you have some time (and a DD). The cocktails are so good and strong, just the way they should be! My biggest wish is that they will open a second location in Downtown Champaign.",

Always ask for more butter, though!They do take-out really well, which is nice since they're always so busy. Everything is wrapped individually and easily reheated. Service is always great. Beers are pretty good. So why the four stars? Partly because I can't give 4.5...but mostly because I LOVE a bloody Mary, and theirs are just terrible. I've tried x3 with no success. They taste overwhelmingly of actual bbq sauce and meat. Like a liquid dinner platter. If that's your thing, go for the 5 stars.",

It only got better from there. Ordered the three meat combo of burnt ends, brisket and ribs. I have to say the burnt ends were my favorite, but they all were perfectly cooked and the taste was outstanding. I went with the Carolina Red sauce and it had just enough zip in it. I was pleasantly surprised with their choice of beers and IPA's. I went with a tough to find Dog Fish Head Brown Ale on tap. I will be back Black Dog very soon. Nice work!",

Large TV's above the bar if you want to watch something or a warm, inviting seating area if you wanna talk. A huge selection of craft beers. And to top it off, seasonal, local specials (I once had the smoked beet salad, which was glorious).Take my word for it, the wait isn't that bad. If you want to go out for great food with an old acquaintance, a business meeting with the roommates or perhaps a casual date with the designated lady/gentleman friend, Black Dog will always do you right.",

The guy who seated us was a little surly but we didn't have to interact with him much.  Our server however, was great fun.  We had the beer flight which was great and then each of us had a sandwich - 2 pulled pork and 2 burnt ends - and then the sweet potato fries.  Sandwiches came with sauce and coleslaw on the sandwich and they were phenomenal.  Price was amazingly low and terrific value for the dollar.",

I didn't know what a treasure we had in CU until I left the Midwest for the bustling East Coast. There, I kept getting email and newsletters that kept telling me that all the way back in CU was one of the country's best BBQ joints! And boy, can you tell the difference when dining in other BBQ locations (granted, I'm trying BBQ on the East Coast, that's mistake #1). But I finally got to come back to Black Dog just a few days ago and boy...boy was this a happy moment. After puzzling through their menu of mouth-watering items (whole platter of burnt ends? Or the pulled pork? Or brisket? Nevermind, got it all), we put down our orders with our very friendly and amused waitress. While we wait for our food, let me describe the place that is Black Dog. It's a cozy little joint that always has a decent crowd of people milling around the outside of its brick building, all waiting for a coveted table inside. Once you make it in, the interior is kinda small. Full of tall wooden tables towards the front and then lined with a couple booths as you head further back. Right across from the booths is the long full bar. It's a warm and cozy looking place, you know, not upscale or fancy in any way, but with that wooden glow that just makes you feel at home and the smell of all of that meat...Our bbq platters are brought out on these cute and convenient tin trays. Aside from their meat, their must-try sides are: sweet potato fries, twice-baked potato casserole and their corn bread. Mmmf you can't go wrong with any of those.Let's start with the meat. The burnt ends. You better get to Black Dog early if you want to sample these babies. Melt in your mouth, smokey, delicious goodness. A perfect ratio of fat and meat. Uuugh. I could have eaten two platters worth of these if I didn't care a wit about my waistline. Then there's the pulled pork. Not the strangely dry stringy pulled pork you might get from other joints. This pulled pork is long, thick, and moist. The bbq sauce you get on the side is perfect for adding the tang/flavor you want--you don't need it to restore moisture back to pulled pork, that's for sure.Then there's the brisket. Tender and juicy. Mmmmf. I don't think I've ever had brisket as flavorful or tender as this. So yes. Champaign-Urbana. You got something good. Real good. I'm super curious about what their new Champaign location is going to be like (it's supposed to be bigger--thank goodness haha). Just don't lose that beautiful quality of yours, Black Dog! I'll bear all the long lines as long as you stay just as good as you are now.",

My wife can't stop talking about how good the burnt ends are, and she must not be the only one because the sell out frequently.

What exactly is it that makes this place so amazing? What is the one ingredient that brings it all into harmony?  Well, after twenty visits, I've figure it out.  It's that waiter. You know the one. The ironic hipster with the glasses and the longish hair who knows every single thing about all of the beer selections and all of the food and who is probably the guy responsible for the fact that Tom Waits is playing and you can just hear it under the really loud sound of the game on the tv at the bar.  This guy is free from the shackles of his hipster tribe, because he's nice. He's kind.  He will figure you out and he will use this knowledge responsibly.  This guy will tell you everything you need to know. He will not patronize you, rush you, brush you off, or forget your table.  He will shine his magical hipster/doofus sparkle charm on you.  He is the patron saint of this restaurant. Go there and ask him to tell you what to eat and what to drink.  Obey him.  Thank him.  Seriously, who is this guy?  I love this guy.",

I first visited when it opened and have been back many many times, bringing new people with me each time and converting them into Black Dog lovers just like me.  The BBQ here is fantastic (declared by a St. Louis girl)!  Whatever you do, you must order their Burnt Ends, either in Sandwich form or as an appetizer.  The pulled pork sandwich and ribs are also great choices, but nothing beats their Burnt Ends.  Another great appetizer is the Texas Caviar, a delicious salsa made with black eyed peas and hominy.  As far as bbq sauce goes, my personal favorite is the Hot Georgia Peach.  It's the perfect mix of a spicy bbq sauce and the sweetness of the regular Georgia Peach sauce.  And the sweet potato fries...oh, the sweet potato fries.  What I wouldn't give to have some right now.  I'm not even going to tell you how good they are, you just need to have some for yourself.This place also has a great beer selection and the servers are friendly and obliging in offering out recommendations.  My friends and I all agree that this place reminds you of a neighborhood bar that you would find in Chicago.  A nice change of pace from all the typical campus bars in CU. Some tips on dining here: it gets packed and fast!  Part of Black Dog's charm is that it's a small bar.  Unfortunately, that means limited seating.  If you want to get a seat before the rush, try to get there before noon for lunch (they open at 11am), or before 5:30 for dinner.  If you happen to find a long line when you get there. Don't leave!! Stick it out! It's worth it.",

I had the pineapple pepper margarita (x3), and a combo platter with brisket, catfish, greens, and twice baked potato casserole. The only bad thing I have to say about this place is that the brisket was dry, but everything else I would order again. You can't go to this place and not have the twice baked potato casserole, though. I wish I had taken home a whole pan of that stuff. There was a long line when we got there, but since there were only 2 in our party, we were seated relatively quickly (about 30 minutes as opposed to an hour and 30 minutes).  They seat smaller parties first, instead of pushing tables together to accommodate larger parties (which was a plus for us!). Our waitress, Liz, was very helpful and relatable, plus she had great recommendations. It was obvious that she was really busy, but she always made sure to check in and see that everything was still good with us. The pulled pork was also really good. Everything on my plate was seasoned really well and the bbq sauces were a really nice touch (Texas & Georgia Peach). I was saying that I can only think of 1 other restaurant where everything I ordered was great (brisket here being the exception)...I highly recommend this place, I doubt you'll be disappointed.",

Went on a Thursday night, and was ushered in to two seats at the end of the bar by the hostess. The bartender/server was nice and was around enough to take our order, and the service was very efficient, almost too efficient. I certainly felt rushed to order, eat my food, pay my bill, and leave so the people waiting could eat. I've been to much busier BBQ places like Oklahoma Joes in Kansas City that operates a similar size joint  out of a gas station and it's all self seating, and although most people won't sit there all day while others wait, they don't hurry you out after you've waiting your turn in line. I probably still had half my food on my plate when I was asked \"are you all done with that?\"... seriously? As for the food, I ordered the cornbread appetizer, and the pork inside was a interesting touch, which I liked. Before we could finish our cornbread the food was already served. I got the pulled pork/brisket combo with twice baked casserole and slaw. The sides were pretty good, though my GF's potato salad had zero flavor. The meat was nothing special. Yes, it was tender, but the pulled pork almost looked roasted rather than smoked, and having an ice cream scoop shaped pork was kinda odd.  The house sauce was what really killed it for me. I really couldn't put my finger on what I don't like about it but the sweet, smoky, kick it has just doesn't do anything for me but overpower the flavor of the meat. And like everyone else says, the place is packed and cramped all the time. If this place is so great then they should give the customer a good overall dining experience and not just rely on their food. I'll try going back again sometime, and who knows I may hit the lottery and be able to get their seemingly impossible to get burnt ends.",

Which I guess is alright cause they have so much other good meat. Their pulled pork is amazing, and so is their brisket. The older guy who seats you sometimes is a mood killer though, that's all I'll say. Expect a wait- you can't call ahead or anything which is a bummer, but it's well worth the wait.",

Regardless, you have so much to choose from (http://www.blackdogsmoke.com/menu/), and don't be stingy with the sauce!  I'm a true Carolina girl at heart, and Black Dog does this Carolina Red that's vinegary and tomato-y, and has a bite to it that'll just.. well, it'll make your mouth water.  Other's really like the Hot Georgia Peach, like the most exquisite combination of both heat and sweet!All in all, you're going to get a fabulous meal here, and for Champaign-Urbana IL, it's some pretty legit BBQ!

The corn bread here is ridiculously good. Be sure to try some of that. Just be careful as it's addicting! I've always found myself buying extra so I can bring it home!Anyways, I always get a sampler of everything there. The brisket and ribs are definitely my favorites there. You can't go wrong with that.They also have some amazing service. From the moment I walked in, there was a guy (forgot his name) that was very inviting and with a great sense of humor. Wish I can go back, but I'm back in LA!",

I also adored the twice baked potato casserole which I learned about from other Yelp reviews.  They even made another batch for us, how terrific!My only issue is that it is always crowded.  So I suggest that you double the size of the place or keep a table that is always available just for me.  Thanks!",

But take a seat at Black Dog and give the best barbecue in central Illinois and arguably some of the best barbecue in the country a try. The original Black Dog location which has been open a couple years, is a narrow and small place, always packed to the brim. Expect to wait for lunch or dinner and even into the early afternoon and evening, this place will be busting at the seams. But that shouldn't be a discouragement, come ready to wait, and ready to eat, because the food is incredible, the beer selection consistently interesting and varied.And the food. There is not a bad option, but there is a best option. The burnt ends, for those not familiar with burnt ends, this is the meat from the end of the brisket pieces prepared for lunch, so there is a limited number. The burnt ends name is a slight misnomer, these are not burnt, but they are cooked, ends of meat, and are immensely flavorful. Topped with a variety of sauces there are some really great options, including Georgia peach (spicy and not) and a few acidic sauces. The sides are also a hit with an amazing twice baked casserole as well as great beans, mac and cheese (on the right day), and sweet potato fries.Don't hesitate, or balk at a wait in line for a table, head here now. Hopefully the new location to be opened in the neat older train station in Champaign will help make some space for meals in both locations, the demand certainly seems to be there.",

Overall:- It's an excellent place for barbecue. I've been here at least five or six times, and have taken family here as well. And I don't even typically enjoy barbecue!",

Every regular menu item is fantastic (the pork, the brisket, the polish, catfish, etc. etc. etc.)  The bbq sauces are amazing as well. Personally I like the chipotle, its spicy and amazing.  The carolina red is great as well with a nice kick, and the hot georgia peach is an awesome combo of sweet and spicy.  If it were just for this it would already be 5 stars.  But it isn't just this.The specials might be even better than the regular bbq.  The cuban is the best cuban I've ever had.  The pastrami is the best pastrami I've ever had.  The new turkey club (twice a week) is THE BEST turkey sandwich I've ever had.  The fried cod on Friday might be the best sandwich all week.   Finally, the tacos and burritos here can stand up to Maize any day.And then there's the beer.  Different craft beers every time you go in there.  Place is just awesome.",

The cornbread, however, was moist and delicious, with lots of good things (pulled pork, etc.) inside.  So, although I didn't care for the barbeque, I raved to everyone I knew about how great the cornbread was.About a year later, I decided to try them again, and ordered some chicken and ribs to go, along with some cornbread.  This time, the chicken was OK, the ribs were still dry, and the cornbread was incredibly dry, with none of the deliciousness I remembered.  I was quite disappointed.Now, when I drive by and see the lines outside the restaurant, I am amazed.  There is nothing special about it.  I have eaten barbeque at many, many restaurants throughout the country, and, solely based on the quality of the meat without rating the sauce, this would probably rank in my bottom third.  (Sauce is irrelevant to good barbeque- The meat is what matters.)",

When they brought the order, the guy told me : \" there's no moist brisket, but here some dripping\". First of all, he lied to my face, I've had moist brisket at numerous BBQ joints and this guy tells me they don't have it? Instead of letting me know and letting me order something else, they brought me DRY briskets and rendered fat to make it \"moist\". I can't take this place seriously as a BBQ restaurant. Maybe if you have some alcohol before eating the food, it would not be so disappointing.",

On that note, I chose the burnt ends and pulled pork, which are always my go-to meats.  I had high hopes, but the burnt ends were really charred and chewy on the crust and excessively fatty otherwise.  With the pork, it had this unexpectedly greasy, slick, plasticy feel, and it made me miss the likes of Smoque in Chicago. My other observation was that the portions of meat were rather skimpy, relative to what I've received at other establishments. Each platter comes with 2 sides, so I chose fries (basic, hard to mess up) and slaw (your healthiest choice of side here).  You also get to choose the kind of BBQ sauce you want, and I was satisfied with the mustard-based one.  Service was really attentive, and no hassle with getting separate checks.  The waiter handled everything on an iPad, and we could choose to have the receipt emailed or printed.",

I had many a fun time at Todd and John's. For me the food in Urbana has always been good. The frustration has been your limited capacity. I cannot tell you the number of times I've come in and you were sold out of my dinner choice. Now to Champaign. I was so excited to learn you were opening in downtown Champaign. Finally I thought no more capacity problems! I first ordered carry out in May--I am a Brisket man and love it moist and with \"bark\". This had neither.  It was fatty and without smoke. Fast forward to today. Ordered Brisket, and Pork  Ribs. Beans dry and SWEET?  Dry? Sweet? Cole slaw warm.Brisket dry.Ribs salty.Muffin moist and yummy! That's Nice. Applesauce spicy? Server overbearing at times. FYI. I think brisket should not require a knife. Getting the check:Now, what's with no printed receipt? Meaning, what's up with no opportunity to review your bill? Server: \"Sorry, I cannot print you a receipt, you can only sign off on the total I am giving you\" Me: How do I know it is accurate?",

I ordered brisket, pulled pork, rib tips, cornbread, twice-baked potatoes, & smoked catfish. Even if you selected from the menu at random you can't go wrong. Everything was delicious.

The bar runs almost the entire length inside, so plenty of seats there with a few booths and high top tables.  High ceilings and windows all around as well, which makes the place feel a little more open than the narrow area suggests.  Love the atmosphere.I showed up about 11:15 am, and there was plenty of seats available.  Though that filled up quickly.  Sitting at the bar, I had no issues with the service.  Food came out before I knew it, and piping hot.  The bartender also new the beer list and we talked a bit about the cask offerings.  This and the Urbana location might be the only place in the area that does cask now.  Which is a shame.  Anyway, ordered the burnt ends sandwich.  Topped with coleslaw and the Carolina Red vinegar based sauce.  I am not a huge fan of coleslaw by itself, but put it on a sandwich and that makes all the difference.  The sauce had the perfect vinegary kick, and the burnt ends are just damn good.  Along with a side of pit beans that were hot, smoky, and sweet.  The burnt ends sell out pretty much everyday.  However, they are always ready at opening, and again at 5pm.10 taps, with two cask offerings (as I said above).  I don't know if I have ever seen North Coast Red Seal on cask, and it was in good condition.  With the rest of the tap selection running from Founders to The Bruery.  Along with Blind Pig, one of the better beer bars in the area. I have always thought the Urbana location was very good, if not excellent, though maybe a little overrated.  Though the burnt ends are very much on point here.  A great beer bar and really good BBQ place in downtown Champaign.",

I like that the new bar that doesn't have that annoying ledge so I can more comfortably enjoy my food. The food is just as amazing and the quality of service is just as good as the original. What I love about Black Dog is that they keep their prices affordable by embracing ways to cut costs by increasing the efficiency of operations - and never compromise on the quality of the food. They were pioneers at the Urbana location when they started having customers sign themselves in on a pad of paper. At the new location, there is a tablet where you sign yourself in. You enter your phone number and you'll be notified when your spot is ready. If you download the app they use to reserve a spot in line, you can even see your spot advancing to the front of the line meaning you can head down the street and grab a drink comfortably knowing when to return.",

I was so excited that a Black Dog location was coming closer to my home, and let me say right up front that the food is ambrosial; the ribs are among the best I've ever tasted. However, now having sampled both the Urbana and Champaign shops, I'm convinced management knows their menu is so superb that they don't really need to care about customer service. Dining in at the Dog is an eternal-wait, cattle call experience in the best of times; now, at the Champaign location, for carryout there is a single line for both ordering and paying for food, which completely defeats the advantage of calling ahead for one's order. After standing in line for several minutes (while my call-ahead order cooled), I decided to have a drink at the bar. Five minutes later, I still wanted a drink at the bar. I don't believe anybody is too busy to say, \"Be with you in a minute\" or \"welcome to Black Dog,\" but apparently they are. I've yet to have a totally positive encounter at Black Dog. My treatment (or lack of same) at the Urbana location during a 2014 visit was so abysmal that a friend informed the owner, who issued a gift certificate. I don't want free food; I want great food from a great staff. I want to be excited about going to the Black Dog, not decide I want a meal there despite the service.",

Onions forgotten both time for my burger (kitchen staff needs to know menu items better),  BBQ sauce forgotten on second visit.  When the kitchen staff runs out of an item from the menu,  instead of just writing it down on a board in the back like every restaurant I've worked at they scream it from the kitchen and all the servers on the floor scream it back. Quite annoying.  The thing I found really odd is their closing process. They don't leave a ticket at your table so you can review your bill. I had to ask to see the charges before payment, and instead of printing a receipt she showed me on her tablet,  very awkward. Also,  the waitress had her long hair down. Kept using her hands to push her hair behind her ears. I'm assuming she didn't wash her hands every time she did that, and I'm sure her hair will find its way into someone's food sometime.",

There was a line out of the door, but you reserved your spot in line by signing your name via an iPad and entering your phone number. You then get a text when they're ready to seat you. This made a big difference because you can see how many are in front of you in line and the progress being made. This allowed us to go next door to another, less crowded bar, and get some beers for the wait. The food was the same and the service was great.",

The server presents you with your bill by shoving an iPad in your face and showing you that you can select a tip of 18%, 20% or 25% \"or custom amount if you'd like...\" and then stands there staring at you while you decide on their tip.There is a great letter to the editor in the November 14, 2015, Champaign-Urbana News Gazette that sums it up.  I was not motivated to write a Yelp review until reading that letter which summed up my dining experience just two weeks earlier.This place would be good if it didn't make me feel so crappy by how little they valued my patronage.

The food comes to the table quickly and cooked to perfection. The wait staff truly seemed to be working as a team, as we had a few different waiters come to our table to make sure our drinks were filled throughout the night. The downside to black dog is that... 1. You can't make reservations2. It is near impossible to bring a big party here unless you're willing to wait an eternityI came on a Sunday night and only had to wait about 10 minutes, but the party of 9 in front of us had already been waiting an hour and weren't seated until later. Another large party in front of us had also been waiting around an hour and eventually just decided to leave.3. They often run out of things...  By 7 or 8:00 a waitress ran us through a long list of things that we could no longer order. After we placed our orders, we heard the kitchen yelling to \"86 x y z of the menu\", meaning more things were now on the \"you can't order\" list. ANYWAY, I totally recommend coming to this place if you're looking for the best BBQ in town. Just stick to small groups and come at weird times to avoid the wait. ;) Also, try the flight of sauces for $2! It's a lot of fun to get the variety.",

All of the best parts about the Urbana location without the cramped quarters and lack of parking!I was raised on Kansas City BBQ and have lived down south in two different states. I moved to CU skeptical of Illinois barbecue.Excellent BBQ was the last thing in the world I thought I'd find here. Black Dog is the real deal. They have the KC style burnt ends. The pulled pork is the meatier Georgia style, and better than any I ever had in Tennessee. The mustard based sauce was authentically Carolina. I swear, the Carolina Red was the best sauce I've had outside of Kansas City. The sauce is actually reminiscent of Gates (Hi! May I help you?!) in Kansas City more than any other sauce I've ever had. The pit beans were real pit beans. (Never got anything comparable in Tennessee.) And the burnt ends were moist, smokey, and delicious. The best part is that the new location has none of the heavy wait in the undersized restaurant feel. There is plenty of space, the food is just as good, and the decor is fabulous! This is an excellent restaurant upgrade.",

I am pleased to report back that the taste and quality that you've experienced and loved in the original Urbana location is definitely here. I called in ahead of time to order 4 platters for the family: burnt ends, beef brisket, salmon, and pulled pork. 20 minutes later, I pulled into downtown Champaign and into their new parking lot.This new Black Dog is situated in an old train depot building. It's a little bit hidden off the intersection of Main St and Chestnut, just around the corner from establishments like Memphis Off Main and etc...makes me wonder if this Black Dog might be open as a late night option for those of us who make a night out of downtown Champaign. The new interior looks beautiful. Full of polished and warm woody browns. I'm super excited for when I come back to Illinois to try dine-in when this place opens up entirely. As for the food, the pick-up was easy enough and after unwrapping the beautiful feast before us, my family came away stuffed and quite happy. All the meat is tender and moist. Again, in Black Dog goodness, the BBQ sauce is delicious and great augmentation to the flavors of the meat. That meat doesn't need sauce in order to be juicy and moist. Praise be!Also, let me tell you. I ordered their smoked salmon for the first time and yes. Please. That is some of the best salmon I've had in a long time. Just like the red meats, the salmon is moist and tender and flakey. Not a hint of dryness in there and just oh so smokey. Why haven't I tried this sooner?So yes, Champaign Black Dog is just as good as Urbana Black Dog, so don't be scared! Come enjoy this place just as much! It probably isn't as crowded as the Urbana location for carry out anyways...Shhhhh",

It's basically in an old train station, but don't let that fool you, the inside is really nice. It's definitely not as cramped as the Urbana restaurant, but with the crowds that Black Dog regularly draws, there still was a considerable number of people just hanging out around the entrance and about a ~15 minute wait on a Saturday at ~4pm.The food, I would say is the same. The Urbana location never fails to disappoint, and the new location similarly made for an excellent BBQ dinner that my family and I enjoyed. I tried the smoked salmon this time as a change of pace and it was delicious.The service was good, it's great to see that BD is hiring servers of the same caliber at the new location. Ours was nice and handled our group of 5 quite well. There was a little mix up on the sides, my grandfather received my sides and I received his. Not a big deal at all.Still probably the best place in town for BBQ, definitely like the new location and it's nice to see a local business expanding like this.",

In my opinion, this place has one of the best smokie \"cooked on wood\" tastes in the area.I used to go a lot on Sundays for their 1/2 chicken special that included a 32oz lemonade shakeup, both which are delicious! All for under $5, this deal can't be beat. All their food has a good smoky flavor and you can order sauce in a few levels of spicyness, on the side or on your meat (usually mix is good).  Most of the items on their menu are pretty good and fresh if you go during the lunch/dinner hours, although the beef ribs might be a little dry at times.All their entrees comes with an order of fries and are served on a tray with paper and foil, basic but gets the job done. The place is quite small and dirty, but the aroma of the smoked wood and the style of food makes it seem more authentic.The quality of food might not be the best, but if you account for their fast service, killer sunday special, good sauce and CHEAP food, this place is definitely for you. In my opinion best bbq \"hole in the wall\" as of now in Chambana.",

That being said, the mediocre sides/atmosphere take one star away from my rating. When I come here, I get whatever is on the daily special (a menu item with a 10% off price).  Everything is great, as long as you come at the right time.  As usual with any BBQ place, you really need to come during lunch/dinner rush hours to have perfectly smoked meat (another 2-3 hours waiting in the smoker will easily dry out the meat). The meat is served with 2 pieces of plain Butternut-looking bread, and steak fries. You can substitute the steak fries for another side if you wish ( I usually pick the baked beans, which seems like they are from a can).The sauce here is delicious! You can pick from Mild, Mixed, Hot, or Xhot Even if you are scared of a little spice, I would at least get Mixed--the mild is way to sweet for my taste.  Watch out the the X-hot, it's very spicy stuff.  I am a spice head and usually get the Hot.  I can handle the X-hot but I reserve it for when I want to be sweating afterwards.Prices are great here! You would be hard pressed to find cheaper well-smoked 'cue anywhere else.  I really don't get everyone's obsession with Black Dog--I feel that they oversmoke their food and overcharge for the small amount that you get there.Bottom line: Real hickory-smoked barbecue for a great price.  Sides are mediocre, but sauce is great.",

Fairly certain I also saw it had won some \"Best Barbeque\" awards for the area.  My hopes were high, but after trying it, I was terribly let down.The barbeque this place serves reminds me of very average cafeteria style food.  I'll say I definitely thought the meat was very good..  (I  have tried the chicken, pork, and beef) and it has a nice smoked taste to it.  Unfortunately, everything else that makes the sandwich fails.  The barbeque sauce, perhaps ultimately the most important ingredient, pretty much is what ruins the sandwich in my opinion.  Like a lot of other reviews have said, the sauce is unduly sweet, and extremely watery.  It almost tastes like drinking liquid sugar in some regards... The bread is not much better.  Sandwiches are literally served on tiny hoagie rolls like the generic ones you buy at the grocery store for $1.  Probably the most generic, cheap type of bread anyone can afford... Sides were also generally unimpressive.  Baked beans were nothing special, and I also had a potato salad side that seriously had almost NO taste to it.  It tasted like eating raw potatoes.All and all, definitely a huge let down for me, and very sub par barbeque and sides.  Really a surprise they keep winning the best Barbeque award for the CU area, but I guess there's no other competition?  Sad to say, but this was probably one of the worst barbeques I've ever had.",

I think some of the low-starred reviews here expected something different than what Lil Porgies is.  Lil Porgies is solid, delicious food for cheap.  If you want fancy sandwiches I recommend Black Dog instead - and the thirty+ minute wait.  If you want something dryer or Texas style, try Hickory River.  But if you want ribs, slathered in sauce, or barbecue chicken this is where you should be.I'm not a big fan of the sandwiches - they are kinda soggy - and I cannot begin to understand why you would order fried shrimp or fish sandwiches at a barbecue place.  The smell of slow cooking wood tells you what you should order.  That smell brightens my evenings as I drive home each night.  The ribs are awesome.  There is a range of quality - some days they are just Very Good, but other days they are Amazing.  I think it has to do with how long they sit on the shelf over the smoke - the longer, the better.  The barbecue chicken is also awesome - tender and very smoky.  I prefer the mixed sauce, which is both sweet and spicy, but the mild is more sweet.  They also sell the sauce along for cheap if, like me, you can't get enough of it.There are some seasonal offerings as well, like chili in a bread bowl or smoked turkey legs.  The chili was good and a reasonable price but I always come back to the pork ribs.  Meals come with big steak fries and white bread, both of which soak up the generous amounts of delicious sauce.  There are daily specials, but the best days are Friday, Saturday, and Sunday - beef ribs, pork ribs, and chicken ribs respectively.  The lemon shake-ups are sweet and delicious, too.I've eaten here many times and never been disappointed.  One of my stand-bys.  When I moved from Champaign to Urbana I was relived that  I was still within a couple minutes' drive of a Lil Porgies.  The building look a little sketchy but it's worth it to stop in.",

I am a university student from Chicago and have had my share of barbecue - Smoque from Chicago, Black Dog, etc. Out of all the barbecue places I have had, I can honestly say that Lil Porgy's is my favorite. My GO-TO is definitely the RIB TIPS (tub o tips can feed 2-3 guys) and the 1/2 chicken with mixed on the side. Some of my best college memories include the tub of tips. So good. Make sure to get the sauce on the side!!! This place is awesome and I will definitely crave it when I leave campus.Tips:-From personal experience, the springfield location seems to have better rib tips and the university location has better chicken.-There are daily specials (I love the Sunday special: 1/2 chicken, fries, and lemon shakeup for $5)-RIB TIPS + MIX ON THE SIDE.",

The sauce had a great flaver.  It had clearly been cooked into the chicken, and not simply poured over it before serving.  The meal was served in a paper basket.  More of the sauce got on the fries than I would have preferred, but it was very good.  The fries were done, but not overly crisp.",

I visited with my entire family (husband, mom, and 2 kids) on a Friday night.  Don't let the outside faade of the building fool you - it might not look like much, but the food is dang good!The Good:  We loved that the menu was limited to a few items (making it easier to make a choice on what to order).  There's your ribs, rib tips, chicken, shrimp, and a few sandwich options.  All orders come with bread and french fries, but there are lots of side options too.The Bad:  I was disappointed to find that there wasn't a kids menu to choose from, so it made ordering something for my toddler very difficult.  (We ended up just letting him choose what he wanted to eat from our plates.)The only negative thing I can say about the food is that the mild sauce tasted too sweet (like cinnamon), but the mixed sauce (a mix of the mild and hot) was great.Overall: Lil Porgy's Bar-B-Q is great for a quick bite to eat.  The rib tips were very tasty, it was just hard to pick something for small kids to eat.",

Tart, sweet, tangy, spicy...so good. It's like A1 sauce in consistency. For those of you that are iffy about the sauce (because it seems like people have mixed reviews on it, get it on the side. That's what I usually do so it doesn't make the bread and fries soggy). I get the sauce on the side as well as some extra. Slap that on those juicy rib tips and I am good.Yes, the lemon shake-up and Tea are amazing also. They have huge sizes for the drinks. I ordered a large and that looked like it was extra large!I love that the fries are actually more like wedges instead of limp soft fries here at some of the more acclaimed places in Chicago.They had great daily specials at around $5 for a meal, but I would recommend the rib tips if it's your first time. They do the ribs and chicken best in my opinion. I haven't even tried any of the other things on the menu (aside from the sweet corn)...and I don't need to.Whenever I drive to the C-U area, I have to pick up some porgies. I MISS IT SO MUCH!Update: Make sure to get the Large sized rib tips. It makes a difference. If you get the small size, they'll sometimes give you some of the tougher ends or pieces they want to get rid of.",

I actually couldn't get them apart to eat them.  The beans and slaw were a-ok but since I was there for the BBQ, I had to give them 2 stars.  It's really too bad because the flavors were really good and the sauce is really solid.  I will be back to try the chicken next time and may update the review at that time.

However in my time of eating barbecue, I would have never thought the best things we could have been served at a barbecue joint were a piece of white bread and a moist towelette. This journey begins the same way it ended, poorly. We arrived at the restaurant about an hour before closing, which one could say that we can't expect much quality. However I believe that if a restaurant is still willing to keep their kitchen open until close, then expecting food quality to be similar from open til close is a fair expectation. We ordered their regular order of rib tips with mix sauce, which for a half-pound of meat was decently priced. When we sat down to eat, we were a bit disappointed that the barbecue sauce was very watery. It's not a sweet sauce at all, but more on the tangy side. It is homemade so that was cool to see. Unfortunately what was not cool were how bland the steak fries were. It was as if they had never seen a grain of salt in their life, and were forced to drown in a watery pool of sauce. Those potatoes never got to see their true potential. This also seemed to be the case for the rib tips. The rib tips were very thin and barely had meat on them. At the end of the day, I will say that you can get well priced barbecue in no time here. However with the meat and potato soup we were served, I would probably take my next bbq purchase elsewhere even if it meant paying a bit more or waiting a bit longer. They probably have other items that are much better, but at this point I'm pretty confident that I won't be returning. I have a better chance of returning to a Golden Coral. Make sure to get a towelette!",

Maybe it was because I visited during a lunch rush last week, I don't know, but the pulled pork sandwich I got was entirely covered in barbecue sauce, which I don't usually mind, but it was completely soggy. The bun was so soggy I couldn't pick up the sandwich, so I used a fork, but even the pork was soggy. I didn't know that pork could be soggy. But it was. I wouldn't have minded that much, but not only did I find the barbecue sauce lacking somewhat, most of the fries were soggy from the sauce. And what few fries weren't soggy from sauce were soggy from the pickle.The entire experience was just a bit off-putting. The lemon shakeup was delicious though. So there's that.I'm definitely willing to give the place a second chance; maybe I just got unlucky that day. I'd be interested to see how their sausage is, too. But unless it goes stupendously better next time, I'll probably go with Black Dog for my BBQ fix.",

The guy who took our order was ok, but when we went to go pick up our order, we asked again for the number that was called.  The guy didn't even answer us and just waved us to go on.  Ok, so we took our order.  We saw people get up and get refills so I went to go stand in line.  The guy just kept on ignoring me as I stood there for a few minutes trying to be polite.  He knew I was there standing there and after giving out a few orders, finally asked me what I wanted.  So I told him and he was rude and told me \"no!\".  Of course, I couldn't understand him so I asked him again for a refill and again, he abruptly said \"No!\"  I told him that I saw others get a free refill and he just walked away, letting me hanging.Wow, so if you don't care about good service and only want good BBQ, this is the place to be.

I found the sauce to be too sweet, tasted like apple pie, but wasn't unpleasant when combined with the rib tips; definitely get it on the side. Not very hot for being 'hot'.Pickle was very good.

The spicy pickles are just that spicy and delish!! The portions are nice and the price reasonable and I do like getting value for my money and Porgy's delivers on that! The bf and I will definitely be back since he loves it too. I can't wait to try the whoa Nelly!!",

Only difference is that I eventually graduated from mild to hot sauce! I personally don't think waiting 30-40 minutes for a table at Black Dog is worth it when Porgy's is within walking distance and is no frills as BBQ should be. Black dog you can keep your fancy local beers and exotic hipster BBQ sauces. I'll skip the side of pretension and stay loyal to Porgy's!",

I went the other day with a few friends of mine.  I saw the shack and as we walked in, no frills, just a simple BBQ hole-in-the-wall.  But see I saw this as promising, because good BBQ doesn't come from a fancy place.  My staff was slightly hard to understand, but took my order.  There's no table service, but I didn't expect that.  I ordered a half-rack with a catfish sandwich and fries.  I was very disappointed.  That fish sandwich came out of someone's freezer.  Literally it was a fried fish patty in a bun.  TADA!  My ribs were less than pleasing.  The bones were everywhere; they gave me the crappiest slab of ribs.  The sauce tastes like apples & cinnamon (honestly, just not my thing for BBQ).  Fries come with every meal, you know like ten fries.  Haha and they had the audacity to put my fries underneath my ribs to smother them in the awful sauce which in the long run made them soggy.Hole-in-the-wall or not...don't need to come back to this place.",

Smoked pork was great and in abundance, barely contained by the bun, while sauce was almost unnecessary as the meat was incredibly juicy and flavorful; sides were fine, standard smokehouse fare. Thrilled to have this additional BBQ option in downtown Urbana (we really have an embarrassment of riches in that regard). I'm looking forward to sampling more from their menu. I don't care if they've figured out the register or not.",

Right now this review is purely food and service based. I ordered the chicken and brisket 2 meat combo. The chicken was by far my favorite out of the two, but that doesn't mean the brisket was sub par in any way. The BBQ sauce was delish. I don't usually eat too much of the bread in order to keep room for meat. In this case I was eating the bread just to get more sauce after I had finished all my meat. Mind you, I'm barely 5ft tall and teetering over 100 lbs and cleared my combo plate. That's how good it was. The service was phenomenal. The staff constantly checked in on us to make sure we were satisfied.The restaurant seats about 25 people and they do have take out.",

We couldn't find the number anywhere online. All we could find was the old number which goes to voicemail. This was probably my biggest frustration. I felt that a business absolutely needs a publicized phone number in order to be successful. So we decided to go in and order take out. When we got there, I saw a huge line for the cash register with a bunch of employees  standing around in the back. After a good 20 minutes of waiting in line, the food took just a couple of minutes to come out. It seemed like they have a lot of kinks to work out. The cashier looked like she had never used a register before. In the end, the pulled pork was delicious and ridiculously juicy. The sides kind of tasted like something they'd serve at a grocery store deli counter. The mac and cheese noodles were over cooked and flavorless. The baked beans just tasted like the sugary stuff they sell in cans. I'll definitely wait to see how they figure things out before coming back.",

I ordered a slab of ribs,  Cole slaw with pineapple,  potatoe salad,  baked beans and greens. Now i have to add i placed this order to go.  Service was good but when i received my order only two if the sides were there.  They corrected the order.  Now the food.  Ribs were very very undercooked.  Had to finish them in my own oven when i got home.  Is there a rub on these ribs?  Could not tell with the sloppy runny bbq sauce.  Average flavor.  Baked beans no big deal no spices to speak  of stood out.   Potato salad and greens were hit heavy with vinegar. ..one star.  And Cole slaw again too much vinegar.  Poor quality.  As a side note so much smoke hanging in the air my shirt the next day smelled very smokey. Will not be found back.  Too expensive and under average food.",

Why I wouldn't go back: the meat was fatty and tough...if the owner is reading this, I would really suggest marinating the meat for hours on end (it really makes a difference!). The rib tips were so fatty that we really got very little meat and were still hungry at the end of out meat.  (so we very shamelessly walked to BlackDog across the way for some brisket and burnt ends, really!).  We got 2 slices of bread, maybe french...that's it, no butter or some nice spread to go with it, good but nothing special.  I'm really hoping this place is successful...I want to be supportive but like other reviewers, there is better bbq around BUT I WILL GO BACK FOR THAT COLESLAW!!!!!!!",

It was empty when I came in the early afternoon so I was greeted warmly at the counter and asked about the menu. After some small talk, I chose the rib tip  platter to go.  There was some confusion about payment and someone else's order, but I understand that is all new business hiccups. The service was fairly quick and staff was so friendly I'm sad to give them two stars. However, those stars are specifically for the food. I give some slack for my to go order being lukewarm since I had to go back to work and eat. The tips however were pretty dry and didn't have any seasoning. I tend to like my tips fatty so the sinewy alternative disappointed me. The side was a small cup of pineapple coleslaw, which essentially was regular cabbage slaw with pineapple chunks in it. The fries were actually good and what I expected. Steak fries make this meal just a little better. BBQ is pretty pricey so I never expect to spend less than $10 for anything I get. I really hope to try some other things and alter my review in the future. I want this place to do well and since it's only the beginning, so they have plenty of time! Here's hoping.",

                "review": "Read the article in the Gazette about the opening, so thought I would try it out.  When we arrived, the crowd was fairly sparse (about three groups dining, no line).  Considering I often wait 20+ minutes at Black Dog, this was a definite plus.  It's the kind of place where you order at the counter and the food is brought out to you, which I prefer for a place like this.When I placed my order, I was informed that they were out of the burnt ends and the pulled chicken (my first two choices) along with a couple sides.  I opted for the brisket sandwich with a side of pit beans, as I feel this is a good barometer of a BBQ restaurant's overall quality.  The sandwich and single side cost me $10.90 (w/ tax, before tip) with no drink.  Not outrageous, but it's probably double what I would have paid at Porgy's and maybe even a little more than Black Dog.The overall quality was fairly average.  The beef had good flavor, but was a little fatty and tough.  The BBQ sauce was very average and in short supply.  The beans were also pretty average. I will say that the amount of meat on the sandwich was very generous and I didn't walk away hungry by any means.  The customer service was great; friendly and quick.  Helped that not many other people were there.Overall, I don't see how this place makes it in an already crowded marketplace for BBQ restaurants.  Black Dog, Po' Boy's, Porgy's, and even Hickory River are better options in my mind (sorry Smoky's) and are right around the corner. Even Chester's BBQ truck at Tumble Inn is probably a better bet.  Not sure how I can justify spending almost $11 on a sandwich and one side when Porgy's is probably better and 40% cheaper.   It doesn't even come close to Black Dog quality, which with a second location opening, is always my first choice.  Also, I am pretty sure they don't have booze (could be wrong about that, I got my order to go).  I hope they can pull it off, but I just don't see choosing this place again with so many better BBQ options available.",

I can personally vouch for the quality of the Polish sausage, the pulled pork, the rib tips, and the beef brisket; all of 'em are great and (of the equivalents I've had) better than Black Dog's. Service is also way better: food is prepared and served very quickly, everybody's really friendly, and the staff checks in frequently to see how the food is and if you need anything.All in all, a great place, and each visit has been a more pleasant experience than any I've ever had at BD. As long as this little gem is in town, I won't be going anywhere else for my barbecue.",

Also, I asked if the coleslaw was vinegar or mayonnaise based and the owner kind of laughed at me and said 'IT'S COLE SLAW'. I was like, which KIND?

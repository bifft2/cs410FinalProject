Maybe it was the dish I ordered, but the Boo Dae Chigae is a very traditional korean dish which is a stew of vegetables, ham, and noodles. The portion is not gigantic where it can be shared, but the unique blend of flavors and spiciness makes it quite a dish on a cold winter day. It is definitely spicy, but that is balanced with the saltiness of the ham/spam. You do get some noodles in the dish, but the stew goes well with the rice also. Plenty of self serve water will put out the fire in your mouth. I can't speak for the other dishes, but this was quite a nice find. Prices have gone up so I was a little surprised this dish set me back 12+ dollars.Pros: tradition korean food, spicy, flavorful, free parking lot, no need to tip, self serve waterCons: expensive for asian food with okay portionHidden deals:The included yellow radish ban chai is delicious, too bad there is only a small dish given with your meal and some complimentary kim chi",

Just a small little shack-type place in a plaza on the edge of campus. So why 5 stars? Because the Korean food here is as authentic and delicious as it gets. This place is for real. It is essentially run by this Korean lady who knows what she's doing. The stews and soups are excellent here, as is the bibimbap! I love coming here after work. A little taste of Korea right in Urbana.What would I recommend?- dolsot bibimbap (in stone bowl) - a Korean classic. - budejigae - a Korean everything stew- bulgogi - meat. Yes.- spicy pork bulgogi - similar to beef bulgogi, but it's spicy. My personal favorite!- spicy tofu soup (soon dubu) - really flavorful and can be spicy- donkatsu - fried pork cutlet. Yes.",

It takes a while because it is freshly fried to order. But don't worry, it is worth the wait. It was so good that I had to go back and get it again the next day. I do not understand why this place is not full of people eating fried chicken all the time. Got a friend who's not a fan of Korean food, but you still want to eat together?

The shop is neatly tucked away in a small plaza and doesn't have a lot of floor and seating space available, but the food more than makes up for it. You get a full meal - rice, miso, pickled vegetables, the sides complement the main dish well. I usually get the spicy chicken bulgogi. Liberal amounts of gochujang paste are used, which gives the chicken and cabbage a rich but not overwhelming spicy and salty character. The spicy pork bulgogi, which looks to be more popular, is probably even better. The katsu is also fantastic and the bibimbap looks appealing. There's plenty to try and plenty of food given each time. I always leave satisfied!",

I always like Korean beef noodle soup and it was my first time ordering this dish at k bowl. The problem was where we sat, we could see the kitchen. We could see the stove. I saw the female chef cooking my soup and tasting it with a silver spoon. She tasted it with the silver spoon and then put the same spoon back to the soup and stirred it. At least 10 times. She even had the lady from the front to go into the kitchen to make sure the taste was fine. So basically there were two people trying my soup before handing it to me. When they gave me the soup and chef all the sudden came out and informed me that she forgot to put the beef in. So she had to take it back to cook more and taste more. Really? It's such a disaster. K bowl, I really want to like you, but it is not too much to ask to have a dish without your peoples tongues in it. Please respond. Thank you.",

I ordered Bi Bim Bap, since it is my favorite Korean food, and it was top and center on their menu.  Everything about the dish was perfect.  It was probably the most beautifully arranged Bi Bim Bap I've seen, which is rather surprising, as I got it to go.  It had a lot of sesame flavor, and there were a lot of sesame seeds visible on it.  The sauce (gochujong, I'm told) was probably the best chili paste I've ever had.  The dish came with separate containers for rice, gochujong, kimchi, soy sauce, and even came with a side order of miso soup.  Everything was fantastic.The woman who took my order didn't speak any English.  But, all I needed to do to order was point.  The restaurant has a couple bar-type seats, or you can get it to go.  It took about 10 minutes for my food to be made, so it isn't the fastest fast food I've had, but it very well may be the best.",

Also had boneless Kalbi and all I can say is weird, weird, weird.  It was like Korean salisbury steak; two ground up beef rib meat, which is fatty and a strange gravy to top it off.  Also way too over priced at $13.95.  I can get something similar but real ribs at Aloha Grill in Chicago for $7.  Im sure everything else here is ok, just stay away if its more than $10, esp the Kalbi.  Yecchh.",

                "review": "I was finally able to give this place a shot today and I was very disappointed. Prior to eating here, I knew from other reviews that the service wasn't the best, but I wanted to go to the restraunt without letting this info skew my opinion. However, I got there and received some of the worst service I've ever gotten. Right off the bat, the young man at the counter was not welcoming at all - it seemed like he didn't want to be working. I asked him if there were any sections for lunch specials in the menu because I saw \"lunch special!\" written on one of the laminated pictures, and he rudely replied with \"no lunch specials.\" Okay then...I paid with my debit card and they do it with an iPad, making you pay tip while they're pointing the iPad at you, which I thought was a bit rude. I gave 15% but I shouldn't have because this guy was extremely rude and they don't serve you at all. It's all self service. Also, I asked for no onions in general for my tofu soup, but when I received my food, there were green onions on top. So I said I had asked for no onions and the guy that took my order first gave me attitude saying \"that's not onions, you didnt tell me no green onions, you just said onions.\" And I replied with, \"they're still onions... I said no onions, I thought that was very clear.\" And he replied with \"you need to specify what you want.\" And I just shrugged it off and was already annoyed with him at this point where I just took the food because I didn't want anymore trouble, and the woman who gave me my food asked the guy as I was leaving if I had an onion allergy where he replied to her saying I had none, I just didn't like them. This was so rude because he doesn't know me (what if I did have allergies) nor was it necessary for him to make it my fault that I didn't specify what kind of onions I didn't want, when I didn't know there were two different types of onions in the soup. So needless to say, I probably won't be returning to the restaurant unless I'm having a huge craving for their mediocre korean food.",

                "review": "The lure of unlimited rice refills & homemade banchan made Woori Jib our first stop in Champaign after hauling all of our belongings halfway across the country & subsisting off of salads from Costco. Woori Jib clearly caters to the hungry college crowd - you place your order up front, pick up utensils, water, & free soup to the right, then snag a table & wait until your order is called out.  After you're done with your meal, you do have to bus your own table a la Ikea style. While Woori Jib is a little pricier than the other local Korean restaurants, it also ranks as one of the highest ones.  The meat-centric dishes will knock you back $10-$12, but you will certainly get what you paid for.  I've had the divinely tender Galbi Ribs & the charred Pork Belly, while the boyfriend is loyal to the Spicy Pork Bulgogi (the only downside is that half the dish was onions). The portion sizes are quite generous, where you can certainly split an entree to feed 2 people with the add cost of $2 for unlimited rice for both, or pack up the other half for some tasty leftovers!*They accept Visa & Mastercard along with cash.",

                "review": "In general, most Champaign area Korean restaurants start out with bad service. This place is no different. After ordering your food, it typically takes 10-15 minutes to get your food, and it doesn't always come out in the same order as you ordered. On top of that, you'll often have other people that cut into line and get the same food that you ordered before they did.On this occasion, I ordered duk mandu guk and it came with soggy seaweed in it. For the price of $10, it was a bit more expensive than other Korean restaurants in the area. In addition, it didn't taste spectacular to any degree. The only consolation was that it came in such a big bowl that I could take a little bit home for a leftover meal.Another dish that is pretty popular is their BBQ bulgogi. It usually comes with a special sauce but it really depends on the day to figure out whether it's good or not. Sometimes, it's under cooked. Other times, it's over cooked and burnt. They also use about a 50% onion to 50% meat ratio so it seems like you are paying for a lot of onions and not a whole lot of meat.The seating is usually crammed so during rush hours, it's hard to find a seat. There is very little room to back your seat out as seats are pretty much back to back.",

                "review": "Other reviewers have described Woori Jib as a \"hole in the wall.\" It definitely is. The place is functional; it caters to the lunchtime campus crowd. The food isn't cheap (around $10-12 for an average lunch), but the place fills up. Most meals include a second bowl of rice for free and a side of kimchi (radish and cabbage style), which is good. The food is not elegant or fancy -- it is tasty, basic, and homestyle. To me, this is comfort food, the kind you might make yourself at home if you had the time (and tended toward Korean comforts). The beef bulgogi comes out sizzling, with thin sliced and seared white onions. It has been marinated in a sweet soy sauce and this sweetness caramelizes nicely upon grilling. The portion is big and filling.The manduguk has a chicken broth base, and includes loads of mild beef dumplings. As is traditional onions, scallions, and eggs flavor the broth with a little dash of dried kelp on top.The dolsot bibimbap is yummy. The meat was not marinated beef in strips, as I've had in the past, but ground beef (that was just okay). The mixed, steamed veggies and the chili paste with fried egg on top were delicious mixed with the crisped rice on the bottom. All that was finished just right.Just to clarify what I've seen in other reviews, when you go in, your whole table orders at the counter together and is given a shared number. When someone from your table has an order up, your number is called. It may be called several times, at different points. If you order a dish that takes longer to prepare than others (like the manduguk) you will find other numbers higher than your own being called. These folks aren't cutting in line -- it's just part of the kitchen's process.Once you pick up your order, you will stop by a side table near the counter to get your silverware / chopsticks, etc. When you have finished, you return to the front on the other side with your tray, which you place in a cafeteria cart. Efficient, no frills, but relatively fast even on busy days (15-20 minutes to get served something cooked up fresh to order).BTW, I've also heard some reviewers writing in to say they feel they've been treated differently because they weren't Korean. I am a Caucasian American and have felt well treated at Woori Jib. Yes, the cashier has assumed on occasion that I and the white people in line behind me are eating together because, well, white. But that's no big deal. The owner thanks me after every stop and the cashiers have helped me to explore and order.",

When you go order they placed it through an ipad. One of the questions is whether to tip 15-25%. Just click no. This is a self serve restaurant from picking up your food to depositing your tray. There is no reason to tip and this just by default. I was craving some other korean dish which was not available here. I went to the kalbi, unfortunately I made the mistake of ordering one that was a stir fry version of kalbi. There was vegetables and it was a soaking mess. I have no idea were my dish went wrong. Small amount of beef, lots of vegetables. Tables are very cramped and the prices are not cheap. My kalbi dish cost 12+ dollars. Overall a big let down, this is a big step below K-bowl which is leading my Korean food experience in champaign.Pros: Unlimited riceCons: Expensive for the quality of food, small spaces, sub-par foodHidden deals:Make sure you don't hit the tip button. This is a SELF-SERVE restaurant",

At first glance the place is a little small and has a very casual setting. There aren't many servers on hand, and it was not too busy when my party went in.  Now if you've been reading my reviews, I never judge a restaurant solely on experience, cause it's all about the food. I didn't mind the small size because it reminded me a family-style, close knit style of eating with friends and family.  The food was decent but not the best I've had. I ordered the spicy pork and got some tofu soup on the side.  When the food came out, the portion size was not as big as other restaurants like Ari-rang or Bwon and did not have much flavor to it. It was kinda bland and not as spicy as I would've like it. Now I remembered one of my friends telling me you could get umlimited soup, so I went to the little station they had set up and it was seaweed soup. The problem with it was that it tasted like water and no flavor at all, so besides it being unlimited, one bowl was enough for me. Everything else was pretty good, the ban chan was good and I enjoyed the free refills on everything, and tofu soup portions were actually of good size. Overall, a pretty decent place, but I've had better Korean food on campus (and off-campus at Bwon) and would recommend trying those places first.",

The counter staff has always been very polite and helpful.  My favorite dish by far is the BBQ fresh bacon (I recommend this HIGHLY), but all of the dishes I've had from Woori Jib have been delicious.  The stir fried dishes come in large portions and have a nice mix of vegetables along with the meat.  The tofu stew is also very good combined with any meat, but is pretty spicy if ordered above mild, so bear this in mind.  The grilled fishes are salty and cooked just right.  The dumplings have a hand-made form and taste.  The kim chee is not as varied as at some restaurants, but also tastes \"fresh\" (as fresh as kim chee should be) and home-made.  If you do have a wait (which is common for any BBQ dishes made to order, at any restaurant), the cabbage soup is there, waiting for you.I'm not particular about ambience, so I don't mind that Woori Jib is a bit like a cafeteria.  I'm all about the food and the prices, and those are both excellent at Woori Jib!",

Their chicken bokkeum is really good (get it spicy!), the soups are pretty good (galbi tang, soon doo bu tofu soup) and their rice bowls are fantastic (bibimbap and dolsot bibimbop in the stone bowl). The sauce is pretty spicy though, so if you normally don't like spicy, get it on the side. Actually, if you don't like spicy food don't get it at all; it's not the same without the sauce. The bulgogi (korean beef) actually isn't the greatest (even though so many say it's fantastic). It's a little too dry, and the marinade could be better. Everything else is really good though; definitely get the free soup (it's always pretty good) and the kimchi and sardines that come with every dish are really good too. Don't be scared of the little fish, just try it.",

The bi bim bap came in a huge silver bowl, not a black cast iron pan, so the rice wasn't cooked crispy but the flavor was good and the hot sauce wasn't too spicy for the non-Korean (or none spicy) eater. The kalibi had a good flavor but the meat on the bones was a little tough.  It came together with a bowl of rice and some hot soup and of course a side dish of kimchi. You order at the front counter and wait for them to call your name. It's self service and self busing afterwards. Quick, low key and easy to eat.  Good place for a tasty meal.",

The soybean soup was simply gritty and tasted like it came from a cheap pre-made mix. They only gave me two pieces of kakdugi and three meagre slices of kimchi. Most Korean restaurants, for $12.00 you get five of six banchan (side dishes). If you want to really experience Korean food, go to Good Fellas. For slightly more, you get the full meal and refills on banchan. And they definitely don't charge you $12.00 for bones and fat.",

Miko has become one of my favorite local restaurants, and I would definitely recommend this to my friends",

I just basically spooned a bunch of different stuff onto my plate and hoped for the best, which was a mistake. Only about half the dishes were any good, and most were cold. There's also a buffet of different rolls. Those were so-so. I suppose if you ate a ton of rolls it might make up for the buffet's price. All in all, I give it a big 'meh.' It's okaaaaay. Nothing special, and I won't be going back.",

This time, I thought everything about my dining experience was pretty bad - bad tasting food, expensive prices, and boring teppanyaki \"show\".  The sushi was terrible.  After waiting for 30 minutes (and the place was empty), my fiance's sashimi came out .  It was not worth the wait as it was super fishy tasting.  He thought that it came from the freezer, yuck.  I had a big roll, which in my opinion, was definitely not \"big\".  The only big thing on it was the many layers of tempura batter.  I felt like I was eating all breading.  I also did not like that the little bit of unagi sauce on the roll had carmelized before gettting to me, weird.  Even though the roll was half off, I felt it was over-priced for the 6 small pieces that I received.  Since we were with a large group for a friend's birthday, we also had teppanyaki.  We received salad (gross dressing!) and egg drop soup (ok).  The rice that the chef made was pretty good, though very heavy on the onions.  He also gave us a cream sauce that reminded me of honey mustard.  While I liked the sauce, I don't feel it went well with anything - maybe I could have used it on my salad to improve the taste!  The chef putting on our little \"show\" was uninteresting, awkward, and boring.  For my meal, I split the filet and shrimp with my fiance, and even the shrimp tasted too fishy.  I'm sure this is standard, but I had to pay an extra $16 to split my fiance's meal.  Everyone assured me that it was worth it because of all the food I got....hmm....I don't consider a small bowl of soup, a crappy salad , and some rice to be that much food.  Everything about the experience was negative.  I struggled with giving them one or two stars.  In the end, I went with one star because I honestly will never return there.  While I've rated other restaurants as twos, I still have hope that maybe sometime I will return and my experience and food will be better....but everything here was so overwhelmingly negative, that I really don't think I will ever go back.  Sad.",

Luckily my waiter was super accommodating and nice about it, and ended up not charging us for the entree. It was the Masaman chicken, which I had previously said was SOOOO good. Well, this time they left out nearly all of the veggies that the menu claimed that the entree had. When I pointed this out, the waiter took it back, and when it came back the second time, the only thing that was different was that there were now cashews!! Dumb!!",

Miko has teppanyaki though, which I guess sets it apart.  Also, the \"Champaign Roll\" at KoFusion is called the \"Urbana Roll\" at Miko (since KoFusion is in Champaign and MiKo is in Urbana).  Hilarious!It's wierd that I think I actually like Miko better than KoFusion, because it is more laid back, but I go to KoFusion much, much more because of the $1 sushi.  The staff at Miko has always been friendlier than at KoFusion, for whatever reason, but the bar is not as good.  Anyway, try the Dragon Roll.  Top Notch",

The sushi is entirely adequate and teh Dragon roll was indeed quite good.  There's a varied array of Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese food available, which seem delightful if not extremely special.The space is large and friendly, yet it was made much more spacious by the lack of people there on a Sunday night.  I enjoyed my chicken katsu (a bit dry, but okay overall), and sushi while taking in the slightly austere decorations (and super cool fish tank).The only thing that made it truly surreal?  The love of the cheesy movie soundtracks.  Primal Fear.  Titanic.  Star Wars. 2001.  All of the pivotal movie scores swelled serenely, lending our conversation an entirely unnecessary gravitas.  In fact, you all should try it--talking about grocery shopping is incredibly portentious when done to \"My Heart Will Go On\" or \"Flight of the Valkyries.\"One big note: Miko's price.  Thank God everything is now half price, which now means that things are *normally* priced.  Otherwise, you'd have a restaurant offering decent food for exhorbitant prices.Now, you have a restaurant that serves decent food for decent prices in a decent setting.In a word, decent.In two words, good sushi.In three words: Celine Dion sings.",

My friend ordered the Bul Go Kee (Sliced NY strip marinated in soy,garlic, and Korean spices, then charbroiled to perfection) which was seasoned really well. This came with a side of rice.I had the Ya Chae Gob-Dol (Rice with assorted vegetables and steamed tofu in a hot stoneware bowl. Stir it up with hot sauce, served on the side.) I had cellophane noodles instead of the rice.This was a pretty funny story. At first I asked our waiter if I could have noodles instead of rice. He veeeeery hesitantly said...\"Welllll I don't know...I'll have to ask the chef...\" We couldn't understand why they couldn't just put noodles on the bottom instead of rice. The guy was hilarious though. He was so awkward about it, but in a cute weird way, not a mean \"I don't want to do it for you way.\" It turns out that because the pot is so hot, he didn't know how the noodles would hold up to the stone pot. The chef said they could do it so I was happy :)The service was okay. There was only one guy working. He was nice though. Didn't refill my water though.",

They have sushi rolls (some raw and some fried), seaweed salad, miso soup, spicy soup, chap chae, sugar donuts, orange slices, salad with an Asian-style dressing, a really good sweet chicken akin to sweet and sour chicken, and either seafood, pork or chicken kalbi...all for under $14!

One major major problem with this taco was that the flavor of the pork belly is completely lost. It almost tastes like you're eating just the veggies and the sauce. The sauce is only good if there is a fatty meat flavor that goes with it.They probably didn't season the pork belly at all. And that's such a shame. I'd probably season it and cook it in sesame oil to bring out the flavor. For 4 dollars this taco was not worth it. I'd give it a 2.5/5 but I'll round up.",

                "review": "Roks Korean BBQ Taco Truck is trying to do in Champaign what is successfully being done in places like LA with Kogi Truck, and Korilla BBQ in NYC.  Review based on the metrics of taste, service, and value. The two most successful Korean BBQ trucks, Kogi Truck in California, and Korilla BBQ in New York are where I base my comparison for these three metrics.  I can say safely that Roks Korean BBQ Taco Truck sits comfortably ranked second among the three.Korilla BBQ, where they charge more, can back up the prices they charge with quick and professional service, and Korean BBQ Tacos that are ridiculously delicious.  Well balanced, deep and heavy flavor in the proteins, paired with bright notes in the slaw and sides that come with it.  Though I would spend more money at Korilla compared to Kogi Truck in LA or Roks, I would never feel like it was wasted money by any means.  Korilla still stands as the defacto standard of delicious Korean BBQ Tacos.Now enter in Roks, trying to build on the success of Korean BBQ Taco trucks, and you find that they build on many of the same principles that Korilla has done so well.  Looking at the metric of taste, Rok's does a great job.  The protein is well seasoned, and supported well with bright balanced notes through radish and lettuce.  The gohchoojjang based sauce they put on top of the lettuce is sweet more than spicy, and ties everything together nicely.  Tacos are a little unwieldy to eat though, and since the sauce is on top of the lettuce, you may find yourself spilling sauce covered lettuce all over yourself while you eat.  They may want to consider putting the sauce over the protect, and then packing in clean lettuce on top.  From a taste perspective however, Rok's is on point as they pay respect to the Korean BBQ taste both of the pork and bulgogi, while keeping it fresh and delicious for the American palette.  Definitely a 4/5 on taste.Now Service.  As well as can be expected for a food truck.  A friendly face at the window, a clear ticket written for my order, money taken, and their off and running to make my food fresh.  The wait was about 4 minutes for the 4 tacos I ordered, which isn't terrible, and they were kind enough to wrap my tacos in a paper bag for me as I was taking my order to go, and wasn't going to eat it right there truck side.  Inside the truck looked nice and clean, which is important to me, and catching a glimpse of a hand sanitizer dispenser is always a welcome sight for a food service truck, just so long as they aren't getting triclosan in my food. =) Definitely a 5/5 on service.Value.  Admittedly, for all of my reviews, it's near impossible to get a 5/5 on value.  But this is probably the most important metric for people these days.  Especially in the food truck industry which is more about function and value, more than it is about a unbridled desire to get high quality delicious food.  At Roks, each taco ran $4.  Coming from my experience with Korilla and Kogi Truck, my immediate reaction was to scoff at the price.  I had a $20 bill in my hand and was expecting to get about $10 back after buying my lunch, and tipping them.  But with a $20, I bought 4 tacos, and tipped them the rest.  It was difficult getting around that price point knowing that Kogi Truck in LA charges something like $2.50 per taco, and have combo deals, 3 tacos and a drink for $8, etc.  But when I got my tacos, and looking at the serving size, it was semi-justifiable, but not really.  Where Roks taco's are bigger than Kogi Truck's, they are the same size as Korilla's, but again, here in Champaign, it was difficult to justify $4 a taco to myself. If I wasn't buying so many tacos so that I could try them and write a review, I would be hard pressed to justify spending $12 or $16 on 3 or 4 tacos.  Considering that Roks is in Champaign, IL, $4 a taco is close to an outrageous price per taco, especially when the serving size would necessitate 3 or 4 tacos as a lunch portion.  So for value, Roks gets a 2/5 rating.  I'm sure on paper, someone can justify $4, to account for operating costs, overhead, and margins, but as a customer who just cares about how much food, and for how much, the taste, while very delicious, still does not justify the $4 cost per taco.It's a difficult because as much as I've been waiting for a Korean BBQ Taco truck in Champaign for a long time, Roks, where their tacos are delicious, I can't see myself going there more than once a month.  The wife however is a big fan and vows to return. She's the reason why the overall rating is 4/5 and not 3/5.A food truck has to work towards gaining daily, or several visits weekly support if it is to be sustainable with decent margins.  But at the $4 price point per taco, it has shifted out of affordable with justifiable value range, to \"once in a while.\"  Good service and tacos, but it has to taste good to my palette AND my wallet for repeat business.  Change it to $3/taco, and I'd be there more often.",

Bulgogi taco was great, sweet and spicy as advertised.  Pork katsu was good but found it a little bland?  Maybe that's because I had it following the rice balls which were outstanding.  They were nicely crisped with a nice spicy aoli on top.  Although it would have been better to have the sauce on the side for dipping.  I'll have to ask next time.Service is steady as there was a several person line the 15 minutes I was there.  I probably waited 5 minutes after placing my order.  Definitely a good place to grab something different for lunch.",

I understand that it's a taco sampler, so each one of them was going to be smaller than regular size tacos, but this is ridiculous. There was almost no meat on any of them. Four tiny tortillas (actually more like three) with almost nothing on them, costing $10. I had such high hopes for roks. I honestly hope they see this review-not so they can know that I'm angry at them, but rather that they will change.For now, if you're craving Korean tacos, just go to spoon house. Their tacos are actually really good.",

                "review": "A new truck to the Champaign area which we noticed after stumbling out of Joe's one night.Korean BBQ tacos sounded pretty good, so each of us ordered something. I believe what I had was called an Ace-Deuce, it had a spicy sauce, lettuce and a few other things on it and the main meat was like seasoned pork. Overall it tasted really good. Definitely a unique flavor that even drunk me was able to remember and now rave about. Perhaps I'm just not experienced with Korean flavors but this was definitely quite good. Lots of good texture, the meat tasted to be of decent quality, fresh veggies, etc.My only qualms, like many others here, is the price. These tacos are expensive, and they are especially small. Like really small, too small to charge $4/taco. My friend was quite let down with the size of the sampler, which, at $10 plus the upcharge he paid for kimchee, was also underwhelming and we both found ourselves hungry after getting home. The problem here is that hungry students know what they can get for X amount of $. If I'm not mistaken, almost all the Mexican places on campus (Maize, Chipotle, El Charro, Burrito King) have a massive burrito that is even less $ than 2 of ROKs tacos. Granted, the better of those places aren't as unique and also not as conveniently open late, but anyone who has been to ROKs and is looking for a full meal knows it probably can't be had there for under $10. Not to mention the often difficult task of having to locate a food truck when it's not in it's usual spot, and potentially having to travel farther. Unfortunately uniqueness and flavor are often overlooked in favor of portion size.If the portion size was improved, I'd be a regular for sure. ROKs has a lot of potential.",

It comes with rice, bean paste soup, side dishes, and fried mackerel fish. I found this to be the most well-balanced meal for those needing to meet the demands of school. I have heard about the customer service being a hit or miss and that's cause you don't speak Korean or you always expect amazing service without tipping well.My suggestion: tip well and they will remember you. Because I knew they were a primary supplier for my Korean fix, I wanted to show them I valued their business. It worked. They remembered what I ordered, I was always seated promptly during busy times, and the owners were never rude to me. I often came alone and they always still cared to ask how my food was-which was always great.I give them 4 stars out of 5 because they close on one of the weekdays, I forget which one. I even forgot when I lived there so I often drove out for no good reason. hah.",

I arrived at 8:45 on a Saturday and unsure how late it was open, checked the sign on the door, which stated they're open until 10:30 every night (except Monday, when the restaurant is closed).  These hours are repeated on the front of their menu as well.  On entering, the genial host welcomed us effusively.  We sat down, ordered, and in five minutes, long before any food, the check arrived, our waiter saying, \"We close at 9:30.  Please pay now.\"  When I pointed out that the sign on the door said the place closes at 10:30, the waiter responded, \"Actually, we close at 9:00.\"  The food arrived, and was delicious (though the speed with which the BBQ was ladled on my plate made it clear that they hoped we'd eat quickly and get out.  I was harassed twice while eating to pay the bill -- clearly their need to cash out taking precedence over my comfort or dining experience.  What was especially galling was that while we were eating, the restaurant staff were setting a table for their own meal.  It was apparent that no one was really going anywhere, and they could easily have let us dine in peace.It's a shame really, that a place with such decent food lacks a basic standard of cordiality.",

                "review": "Given the size of Champaign-Urbana, I was quite surprised by the number of Korean restaurants in this town.  I have had generally good experiences at each one, but B Won is by far my favorite, especially as it is the best option for more formal dinners.B Won radiates with casual elegance unlike the other Korean restaurants here, which feel more like sweaty lunch spots for strung-out college students.  The real benefit of this building's high ceilings and good ventilation is that you don't feel like you're sitting in the characteristic smoke clouds found at most Korean restaurants (delicious, delicious barbecue smoke clouds--but, smoke clouds nonetheless).The sophistication of B Won is also reflected in a menu that is both diverse and interesting.  They have all the standards, like bulgolgi, jiggae, and bibimbap, but they really separate themselves from other Korean places in the variety of noodles, soups, and casseroles they serve.  Each item in the menu is given a description of the full complement of the dish's ingredients, which can be helpful for diners unfamiliar with Korean cuisine--and reading about ingredients like bellflower root and sweet potato noodles just makes you feel like you'll be enjoying an exotic meal.  During the winter, I love to eat their soups made of beef bones, which are always filling and well-seasoned.  I also have to pay compliments to the kimchi, which really stands out among the side dishes for me.  I usually overlook the nappa kimchi in favor of other dishes that I prefer, but at B Won, the kimchi has what I would describe as a very distinctive, carbon-y (think soda fizz) sensation in the mouth.Lastly, I want to address comments from other reviewers about the behavior of the owner and wait staff.  Although I'll admit that the waiters seem a bit socially inappropriate (by American standards), my own experiences give me the impression that their actions are mainly innocuous and can be attributed to cultural differences.  My experiences aren't intended to dismiss the feelings of obvious discomfort felt by other patrons; I'm just merely trying to cast a more humorous, silly light on the situation.  One time, I went with friends and we all ordered entrees.  The waiter asked if we wanted white rice or mixed rice (a blend made of several types of rice, grains, and beans).  My friend asked, \"What's mixed rice?\"  We saw the waiter struggle for an English description: \"It's, uh...well...it's...it's...it's good.  Yeah, it's good.\"  We had a laugh and just ordered the mixed rice, given his recommendation that it was good.  Another time, we had just finished a meal and received our check, which comes with pieces of corn-flavored candy.  My friends were weirded-out by the flavor and didn't eat their candy, much to the chagrin of the waiter when he returned to our table.  He asked why they weren't eating it (rejection of food is considered pretty rude in Asian culture), but I quickly picked up the candy and said, \"You don't want it?  I'll eat it then.\"  That seemed to resolve the whole situation, as the waiter hurried back with our change and more pieces of corn candy for me.",

It's located on a nondescript strip mall on Neil, and unfortunately hard to get to without a car.  (Disclaimer: Not Korean) I have been here once, a long time ago, and twice in more recent memory. Both of these times, I have ordered the fried rice with tender beef, because it is honestly one of the best dishes of fried rice I have ever tasted. Whatever, I don't care that it probably isn't that authentic of a dish; I wish I could cook a batch of fried rice that good. There are many types of veggies cooked in with the dish, but they're mainly there for texture and flavor. It all ends up creating this fairly homogenous taste, but it doesn't matter, it's homogenous like a tub of butter pecan ice cream is homogenous; sure, there's no variation, but in the end, it still tastes really good and you're happy to eat more.  The rest of the menu is vast, containing foods that I don't know how to pronounce nor consume. Also, don't forget that they bring out six dishes of banchan, small accompaniments that go with your meal. All of this makes for a (seemingly) authentic experience that's pretty good for central Illinois.  The owner is a pretty animated guy, always staying busy at the counter, and keeping this place immaculately clean. He's a bit aloof, probably because his English isn't so good, but I'm sure he's a lot more chatty and helpful in Korean, and the same goes for another  waitress.",

I've had an AMAZING Korean meal before and since then I've been trying to replicate that experience. No success though.So why B-Won over the 3 other Korean places on campus (4 if you count Spoon house)? Maybe it's simply because of the ambient. Even though the waiter spoke little English and wasn't able to offer any helpful recommendation, the overall ambient was much less chaotic than other Korean restaurants. The restaurant wasn't too loud to talk or too smoky too breathe. I don't know if the food is any better because I never seem to get the same dishes to compare, but the experience was more enjoyable.",

However, even among the pile Asian restaurants, the name B Won weighs a ton. B Won is a Korean restaurant that is ran by Korean owners and chefs. Needless to say, their authenticity is not to be questioned. And I mean it. I ordered D2, otherwise known as \"bos-som\". It is a dish that is meant for two or three people to share. But since I am a \"phat\" butt, I had it all for myself. On it, comes with seasoned/cooked pork belly along with radish, and raw garlic/jalepeno and lettuce. In case you haven't figure out yet, you are suppose to wrap each of those aforementioned ingredients in the lettuce leaf and eat it whole. The dish, though may seem like a very simple dish to prepare, emphasizes knife work above all else. All the pieces were cut to the same size so perfectly that you would think a machine did it. Some ingredients taste may actually vary depends on the way a chef cut into the ingredients. Upon ordering, you are given a bowl of rice and numerous side dishes, as per Korean culture. Those are free refill. So do dig away. Though be careful, some of those small side dishes may not be for the faint-hearted that are not familiar with authentic Asian cuisine. The restaurant itself is very spacious. The lighting is sufficient, but not too bright to take away the mood. The staff are very nice and attentive (and they have to, with the free to refill side dishes policies). Though high traffic, both the common area and the restrooms are clean beyond my wildest imagination. If you are looking for the best Korean restaurant in town, stop looking and just go.",

The food is worse than at Woori Jib (when cooked by the boss there, not by the Mexican \"substitute-chef\" who has no idea what he is doing) or at Good Fella, also on Neil, which is overall the best Korean restaurant in town. Both my and my friend's dishes were VERY salty and unhealthy, a ton of salt, MSG and excessive oil. Yes, we know that Korean food is not necessarily dietetic, but it CAN be extremely tasty and well-cooked without sending you to the hospital. It's hard to believe how people talk about how this would be \"authentic\" Korean food. Far from it, it is a bastardized, vulgar version of Korean recipes, with unhealthy, unbalanced spices piled up in order to shock the tastebuds of (sorry) undiscerning customers. Your tongue will be anesthetized, your stomach, liver and kidneys will NOT thank you. The atmosphere is awful. The owner and the waiters are rude, they give you the impression that they don't want you there, that you're intruding on them while they have better things to do. A guy basically ORDERED us to order RIGHT AWAY. We've received just a tad of tea in some odd glasses and FOR 40 MINUTES we never had a tea refill and no waiter ever asked us whether everything is OK, whether we need anything else etc. Given how salty the food was, we were really thirsty, not that they cared.We'll never go back. For those of you familiar with the British series Fawlty Towers, this is the closest experience to that one which we've ever had in Urbana-Champaign. The only place which serves food which is even worse is The Great impasta, but B-Won takes the trophy for the worst service in town. By comparison, Soup Nazi from Seinfeld was a gentleman.",

That was a thumbs up. Along with the beef bulgogi we got soon dubu jjigae (spicy soup that has tofu in it), a salad, and 7...not 1 or 2... but 7 side dishes. That's pretty impressive. The side dishes were delicious. The beef was perfectly cooked at that time. I love how marinated sauce thickens by the time the meat was completely cooked, it has so much flavor to it and there's that hint of sweetness to it.Ok second time we visited, me and my sister ordered the same food cuz, well, we freakin love the first one that much. To my surprised, it was more of let-down. The beef was harder to chew, the sauce that comes with the beef was rather runny or liquidy compared to the thick yummilicious one, and the soup wasn't as warm as before and got cold pretty quick. At both times someone was cooking the bulgogi for us (We just don't know how to do it.. or I guess we're just spoiled lol) and by the same person. The people were really nice though, very nice. I just didn't like the food the second time around. Am I going to this place again? Why not. I've only tasted one dish and I want to try others. This would've been easily a 4 if the food was prepared the same way as before. Consistency is important.",

The noodles were good, but it was very sweet and needed more vegetables. The bi bim bap is really good, and doesn't skimp on ingredients. I didn't try the stew, but it was well-received.

Thin round noodles (thicker than angel hair and clear) were sauteed and stirred fried very graciously with the slightly sweet and salty and greasy sauce. Beef slices bound into chunks but absorbed the sauce well. The Veggies were too thin-cut and too little. An improvement space there.Overall, 3.5 stars for the above and 5 stars for the seafood pancake (tons of green onions, if you can get pass with that).",

I really didn't expect too much when I decided to give it a try for dinner, first because I've had some disappointing experiences with Korean food in the past, and second because of its weird location outside of town and tucked between the train track and a GM dealership. I got there at around 9pm (which is late for getting dinner on a weekday in Champaign), and surprisingly enough the place was quite happening (it wasn't nearly full, there were a good dozen of people or so). The interior is a little bare, but it's clean, modern and well lit. The menu selection is extensive, and while I'm by no means a connoisseur of Korean food, they seemed to offer a lot of pretty typical dishes. I ordered the stir-fried squid in spicy sauce (see picture... I love squid and will order it whenever I can, which is surprising considering I wouldn't even consider eating it just a few years ago... but I digress), and it was pretty good. The squid was just a tiny little bit too tough, and this could have been expected considering the distance to the nearest ocean(!), but it was still very good. And not to forget: this little side dishes were plentiful and delicious (again see picture), and it also came with a bowl of rice and soup... I'm happy I didn't order any appetizer, which I was considering doing upon getting there, because that plenty of food already. All of that for a very reasonable price ($10.50). Sure, this may not be the best Korean food I've had, but it was still very good, filling and relatively cheap... how much more does one really need?...  4-1/2 stars.",

The bulgogi was above average, though it wasn't grilled.  That was sad.  However, it came with plenty of tasty sides and a bowl of miso soup.  It also came with a salad with a kim chee-esque vinegrette.  Sundobu jigae and Pa chun:  Nothing particularily special, but quite tasty.",

We ordered the spicy beef soup (yuk gae jang) and the spicy cold noodles (bi bim naeng myun) and it was very good. And it's not even that pricey. Around $10 per dish.. not even that much more at all than the restaurants in campus town. Whoever said it was way pricier must be trippin..",

Some dishes needed to be cooked at the tables so that further limited the service. We had to wait 20+ minutes after sitting down before ordering.Serving sizes were generous but they were very stingy on the rice. When we asked for more, the waiter let out a large exasperated sigh before complying. Quite unprofessional. When we asked for more water, again with the exasperated sigh. So sorry for inconveniencing you! We ordered our dishes with white rice, but when our food was brought out, we got red rice instead. We told them we ordered white, but they said that they were out and red was all they had and left it at that.You have the option of having meat grilled at your table on a portable stove, which is nice, but after they brought the stove out and lit the fire and poured oil in the pan, they left for around 15 minutes. In addition to the increasingly hot oil that was sitting right in front of us, the pan was leaking oil over the open fire and the table. When this was brought up, they brushed it off saying it was okay. They never cleaned up the oil on our table.After we finished our meal, we waited quite a while for our check. Eventually, we were fed up with waiting and we got up to go get someone to bring us the check. When the check arrived, we quickly threw in our credit cards and set it to the side of the table (cards sticking out, easily visible) and proceeded to wait another 15 minutes before they came back to pick up the check. After that it was a good 20 minutes before we got our cards back.TL;DR Food is good, but service is atrocious.",

I have seen a lot of reviews saying the service was terrible, but in my multiple times have no experienced it. The owned is usually there and they are very welcoming to kids, which is sometimes tough to find.The Bi-Um-Bop is by far my recommendation. It comes in a hot pot with an egg on top, and has great veggies in it. The Rice cooks to the bottom of the pot making this fantastic, crunchy texture to the meal. The sauce they provide is amazing, but spicy so add at your own level of tolerance. Other great dishes include: Spicy Octopus, Bulgogi, Chop Cha.",

The food was so-so, nothing special. The side dishes were okay, but the servings were small and no one offered to refill them. The main dishes were bland at best (seafood dolsot bi bim bap and bean sprout stew with dried pollack and bean curd). The stew was spicy even though there was no spice indication in the menu (not necessarily bad, but not good when unexpected). The prices were a little high considering you can get the same portion size at other Korean restaurants for a couple bucks less. I would definitely go to Woori Jib before coming back to B Won.",

It's an elegant little restaurant with a very friendly and polite staff. They always greet us warmly and service is good.  I have to say that the gold standard for me is a positively ambrosial 8-course Korean meal I had at a family restaurant in Honolulu back in the 80's.  I've never had anything like it since then.  I remember it being the heartiest of Asian cuisines, but very low-fat.  B Won's food tends to be kind of oily.  I usually get the mixed vegetable with sliced ribeye, and that's quite good.  I'm also very fond of the squid pancake and all the luscious little dishes they serve to be shared communally as appetizers (pickled ginger,  sprouts, turnips, and a half-dozen other things.)  I could live without the barley tea or the rice candy, but B Won is usually filled with Korean people and I understand that these are items that they expect and enjoy.  I like B Won and don't mind going there now and again.",

The steamed and fried dumplings were delicious and the bulgogi is my hands down favorite.  I recommend the multi grain rice, it has more flavor.  I am by no means an expert in Korean food but I sure know friendly and polite employees who work in a clean restaurant that serves tasty, fresh food.  Give it a try!",

The strengths:  Try the S6 spicy chicken and cabbage.  Or the seafood pancake.  Of course the classics are good too -- Bulgogi, Bebimbap hot and cold.  They also make a mean takeout box because they include a solid selection of banchan (the little appetizer dishes).  I also like the mixed rice which I have not seen elsewhere in town.  Service can be slow.",

The sauce that was out for the Bi-Bim-Bop was supposedly spicy, but I dumped a ton on  my dish and barely felt the heat, though it was flavorful.  You can get their varieties of meats (and now tofu) as a \"bowl\" with rice, or as a \"tray\" with rice, noodles, and a salad.  My friend got the tray, and that thing was huge!  The burrito that somebody else got was so-so for the price, but was still tasty.  There is radish kimchi for free at the counter...I wasn't a fan...and they have to-go boxes out for the taking, as the \"trays\" could easily serve as two meals.  I can't wait to go again!",

I had Korean tacos for the first time a year ago, in LA, the home of Korean-Mexican fusion. Despite being two thousand miles away, Spoon House's tacos are definitely good enough to compete with those on the west coast. To know my knowledge, they're the only restaurant in town that serves such a dish; they're both delicious and reasonably-priced, which adds to their good reputation. Go for the beef bulgogi taco and the spicy chicken taco, those are the two best. Personally, I feel that they are too heavy to be eaten exclusively as a meal, so you're best off ordering a small rice or noodle dish with several tacos on the side, so it's easier on the stomach. I would avoid the quesadillas, the saltiness overwhelmed the taste of the meat. I can't really speak for the rest of the menu, but those tacos are quite a gem.",

Service was quick but the meat tasted overcooked and dry. We came within the last hour of closing so the service was all over the place. The rest of my party had to wait 15-20 minutes for their food to be ready and they messed up one of my friend's order twice. They also seemed to try to usher everyone out by putting the rest of the orders after mine in to-go boxes. On the plus side, they sell bubble tea from Cocomero but they also ran out of boba while we were there.",

In our generous (and food-wise varied) Urbana-Champaign, I can only think of Great Impasta (POST-change of place/owner) that offered food as bad as this one. The amount of salt (and/or MSG) used makes the food to border on inedible. A bad sign was that there wasn't one Korean person inside, only Caucasians. I should have known better.",

Then again, you learn after a while to take reviews (even those with a 100+ comments) with a grain of salt. Last week I went to a 4.5-star rated Korean restaurant rated by 220 people and left pretty disappointed, while my mom+sister vowed to never trust my recommendations again.I should note that I don't go to UIUC, so I can't compare this with other restaurants in the area, but for what it is, Spoon House is pretty darn decent. They have innovative menu items (Korean tacos, anyone? or galbi-filled onigiri?), nice decor, decent food...what else do you want from a casual spot? It's not trying to be a a candle-lit date-night gourmet spot, so I won't hold it to such standards.I had the spicy tofu pan noodles, my mom got the bibimbop with stone bowl (not worth the extra $2 but otherwise good), and my sister the milk tea and two tacos. My pan noodles were surprisingly made from pad thai noodles and tasted fine, but I just wouldn't have expected to find pad thai noodles from a Korean restaurant. My mom's bibimbop was again, pretty good, except they were a bit skimpy on the beef. My sister's milk tea was from powder for $4, but that's what floats her boat & the tapioca perfectly done. There's no table-side service. All in all, I'd definitely consider stopping by again when I'm in town :)",

Actual effort went into presentation, which was a bit of a surprise, and the service was pleasant enough.  Flavor wise, the ingredients were fresh and well prepared, but the burrito itself was sweet to a fault.  The atmosphere is pretty surreal though.  A strange mix of Motown, Coldplay, and some indie rock are piped through the speakers.  Phrases like \"Dream, until your dreams come true\" are painted on the walls.  Large, shiny spoons are hung from the walls.  For Korean, you're probably better off at A-ri-rang.  That being said I've definitely had worse, and the place itself is kind of a trip.",

I was kind of hoping the regular price was worth it, but I was disappointed. By no means did they taste bad, but they weren't great either. I was kind of irked by the sogginess. It was all mushy and the juices from the meat mixing with the sauce made eating the \"taco\" like eating a moist sponge. I got a bulgogi beef and bulgogi chicken taco, and I noticed this was the same issue for both tacos. The beef was okay, but didn't have much flavor besides being spicy. The chicken was a bit dry, but despite that, it tasted pretty good with a mix of sweet and spicy. I'm not a pro on Korean food, but I think K-Bowl and Arirang do it better along with better pricing/portions.",

They have $1 tacos on Tuesday and Thursdays, but since we went on Wednesday there was no deal in sight. We were told that the $1 are smaller as well. I still wanted a taco so I tried a sweet and spicy chicken taco and the beef taco. My friend warned me that their special taco sauce can be overpowering so I'm glad they only gave me a little. The tacos were fairly large so I didn't mind the $6 price tag. The spicy chicken was just right and flavorful. I added a little soy to balance the heat. However, the tortilla was really dry and thick. You should never taste the tortilla before you taste the filling. The other taco, the beef, was okay. The meat was a little dry and it was a little bland even with their taco sauce. Unfortunately my soy sauce could not improve it either. I was happy to see they have the flavored Aloe Vera drinks (Pomegranate!) so that topped off a pretty decent meal.Oh, as for ambiance, the place is bright, clean, and has plenty of seating. You are expected to go get your food and there is a ticketing system so don't throw away your receipt until you know your order number.TLDR: Get sweet/spicy chicken taco with soy sauce or stick to the Korean menu",

From the name of the place, Spoon House, I was hoping to sit in front of a hot bowl of traditional Korean soup on a nice cold night but the name was a little deceiving. The place was very bright and well-lit. The menu was lit on flat screen TVs which was a pretty cool feature in the restaurant. The menu consist of Korean-style tacos/burritos, Spoon House trays (Korean-style meat entree), and rice and noodle dishes, however, the menu was limited and a little random? One of the random dish was a ramen and kimbap combo (korean-style sushi)  which seems like a genius idea since this place is located on a college campus. I mean, what college kid wouldn't like that? My boyfriend and I (yes, I mention him every time I yelp... we like to eat a lot) shared a 3 taco combo special which include a fountain drink for $6.95 and Bulgogi tray. We also got an extra taco (each taco cost $2.00) to divide the food equally. The wait for the food was a little long since it wasn't busy which I can see as an issue during busy hours, but I didn't mind the wait. More importantly, let me talk about my meal....The tacos were nothing special. If you get the 3 taco combo special, it's nice that you can mix your pick of types of taco meat (bulgogi beef, bulgogi chicken, sweet and spicy chicken, or spicy pork). In my opinion I thought the tacos were eh okay. On a good note, the tacos felt light. I didn't feel like I want to roll home like I do when I eat Chipotle's burrito. The Bulgogi tray was pretty disappointing... maybe because of my Korean background, and growing up with awesome Korean mom/cook, I judge Korean meals critically. The bulgogi tray came with rice, side salad, 2 puny potstickers, an eggroll, and sweet potato fries. Suggestion... if you claim you're a Korean restaurant, why wouldn't you add kimchi in the tray? Kimchi is ubiquitous dish for Koreans. It's kinda of an insult to not have Kimchi at a Korean restaurant. Overall, the experience (food, service, atmosphere) wasn't terrible but  it was mediocre. It seems like Spoon House has catered their menu towards Western's taste. The food seems healthy and fresh, which you don't really get from other restaurants on Green Street. I wouldn't mind going to there again, but I might have to try something else on the menu. I wish their business good luck.",

Its main ingredient is kochujang, which is a red pepper paste that is prevalent in Korean cooking. Many Korean cooks have their own personal recipes for making that particular sauce. My mother uses sesame oil, sprite, fresh garlic, and other ingredients.Also, I believe Spoon House is following the trend on the West coast of putting Korean-style prepared meats into typically Mexican fare, such as burritos, tacos, and quesadillas. As such, the name bulgogi burrito is not offensive. My personal experiences at Spoon House have not been that great. Ddukbokki is one of my favorites, and I was slightly disappointed by their version. The dish had less heat and more sweetness than I cared for. I also did not care for their yukgaejang. The kimchi that was available on my first visit was watered down and bland, but was improved on my second visit. The bulgogi quesadilla, however, was pretty tasty, and I enjoy their bright colorful interior. Overall, I would go elsewhere for Korean cuisine, but would come back for Spoon House's burritos and quesadillas.",

Let loose the rotten tomatoes.I really wanted to give two stars, but taking my dislike into account, I'm giving 3.  I got the sweet and spicy chicken tray, which came with rice, roasted potatoes, and a salad.  It was entirely too much food, but that's a different story.The chicken itself was cooked well, but the sauce was just kind of blah, and not spicy enough.  The salad was fresh and the dressing was pretty good.  The potatoes, believe it or not, were the star of the tray.  They were cooked to perfection, and seasoned perfectly with salt and (I think) parmesan.  Really sort of an odd side, but it worked.  It all came on a neat tray, dividing all the foods from one another.  I love that.  I know I'm a weirdo.It was all a bit expensive, too.  The tray--though I previously mentioned was way too much food for me--was $13 not including a drink, which was more than it was worth, in my opinion.I'm also torn on the ordering system.  They give you a number and have you sit, then your number pops up on a screen above the counter when it's ready.  Quite efficient and convenient, but the bell got annoying after going off so many times and it kind of reminded me of the DMV.",

I've been here a few times already, two times with some friends in my department and another to take my friend out for a birthday dinner. Both times, I got tacos (specifically spicy chicken and sweet and sour.) I've also tried bits of their other flavors of taco as well as their udon noodle soup. The food is sometimes a bit salty, but it may have just been that isolated visit that had that problem.Don't get me wrong, the food is pretty solid, the tacos are on point, and their tea is good. I like how they let you service your own water in an easy and sanitary way (there's a dispenser along one of the walls next to the cutlery and napkins.)The decor is really homey and cute, almost like cafes in Korea. The walls are bright and the decorations are great. The restaurant is roomy and you won't have a problem finding a place to sit. Now that I've listed some of the positive, let me tell you about my biggest reservation about this place. It is so, so, so slow, There could be only 4 people waiting for food and it'd still take upwards of 15 minutes to get out 3 tacos. For this reason, I there aren't ever a ton of people waiting which lessens the problem but still, it shouldn't take so long to get food. Additionally, I've heard from many friends that the staff can be unfriendly at times. I'm not sure who they are talking about because I've never felt like the staff were particularly rude or impolite.All in all, if you're not in a hurry, grab a comfy seat and take in the atmosphere. The food is good if you're willing to wait. Happy Eating!",

The stone bowl was not as hot and therefore the rice didn't scorch the way it should, and the final insult was that the Srirachi sauce was served in squirters labeled: \"Bi Bim Bap sauce--hot\".  It would be as if McDonald's labeled their ketchup: \"hamburger sauce\", assuming the customers had no idea what the food was like or how to use the sauce.Lastly, the reference to burritos, tacos and quesadillas is offensive.

My stomach feels like it's being stabbed by a thousand treacherous knives, and my boyfriend is not doing much better. We're getting chills, we're achy, and we can't do much beyond lay on our backs and bemoan our pathetic existence.Around 10:30, calamity hit. Our apartment bathroom devolved into a Lord of the Flies scenario, with both of us fighting past each other to find something, anything, to throw up into. Vomit the consistency of wet granola spewed out of each of us like buckshot. I will spare you the details of our other bodily functions, but let's just say that by dawn, our bathroom resembled a Pollock. My boyfriend only vomited once. One of the unfortunate souls we dined with threw up over twelve times All of us were too weak to do much beyond lay on our respective bathroom floors, undergo unspeakably painful stomach cramps, vomit, and pray for an Easter miracle. Spoon House, all of Neptune's great ocean will not wash this blood from your hands. We're graduate students. We all have deadlines and conferences coming up, and having to sleep in a bathtub because I just can't stop throwing up is not the best use of my time. The fact that all five of us had different dishes just underscores the fact that you guys need to start following health code before you get shut down. As per my scorched earth policy, I will never go back and I will warn all of my friends about your culinary betrayals. Get it together.",

With that said, each and every one of those would try to have their specialty to out-do the others. A-Ri-Rang, in my opinion, does stand out compare to its competitors in its own unique way. In my personal opinion, I find A-Ri-Rang to be much cleaner than its competitors. Furthermore, the layout of the tables were done in such a way that it would not block incoming traffic, which, if you are a regular at Woorijib, would probably understand what I mean. Every day, there is always a lunch special going on. And it is most definitely worth every penny! For approximately $7-8 dollars, you would get a bowl of rice, a fish, and a soup of choice. Now, this may not sound like a lot, but the soup that comes with it is more like a stew. I always get the Soon-dobu jigae (forgive me if I spelled it right). In English? Tofu Stew. It is a LOT more filling than you think if you never had it before. Trust me on this. If there is anything you really need to know about A-Ri-Rang, is that their stew/soup food items are superior than their competitors. Therefore, if you are not sure what you want to get, if you stick with this guideline, you really can't go wrong!With reasonable price and delicious food, I would highly recommend this place to anyone!",

It looked like most of the foreign students in there were also ordering soups (could have been because it was really chilly).The soup came with a large portion of rice and only 3 kimchees (not really banchan). Oddly enough, there were somen noodles in mine but the soup was deeply flavored and I was more than satisfied it. I can't wait to come back to IL to get another bowl of this soup, its my comfort food when I am on the road for recruiting.",

By far best Budae Jigae.Also try the Omu Rice. It's their version of omelet fried rice. Fried rice is wrapped in omelet egg.I'm an easy going customer so the owner being not too friendly is not a big deal to me. In fact, what do you expect at a no-waiter restaurant?

We decided to stop for a quick lunch and ended up at the first restaurant that opened at 11 AM on a weekday. It was easy to order because we were the first customers of the day. They have a nice laminated menu at the desk to chose your entree. It would be nicer if they had pictures instead of a word description of each item. I selected the combo platter of bulgogi which was 9.99. Afterwards it was a long wait of approximately 25 minutes before we got our food. The dish itself came with a large amount of rice and 2 ban chae along with a bean soup. Based on the pictures I could have chose the beef bulgogi paid less and likely gotten the same amount of food except less variety. The bulgogi was well seasoned, but the meat was cut into smaller slices which detracted from it. Prices have gone up according to my wife since she was in college. Overall slightly above average, I will have to find another korean restaurant to compare too.Pro: average price korean food, large portionCons: long cook time, higher price than average lunch placesHidden gem:Your meal comes with rice, soup, and 2 korean ban chae",

For those who don't know what it is, it's basically ramen mixed with sausage, pork belly, spam, dumplings, and vegetables. You can also choose the level of spiciness of the broth. For the typical broke college student, the prices are low compared to other places on campus and they give you a lot of food all for under $10. If I had to rate the budaejigae, I'd give it five stars based on taste and the sides offered along with it. Also, there was so much, I had to take home half in a box.It's true the owner isn't very talkative, but that's due to a language barrier and it's not fair to deduct any stars for that. There's also no waiter service, but it's a casual restaurant, so this is to be expected. Another thing to note is that it's very clean compared to other places, which is a nice touch. It's not the best Korean food I've had, but it's quite filling especially when you've got an urge to get Korean food.",

Um, okay.. So I order one of the specials, which is tofu soup and fish. I actually enjoy the salty fish and the kimchi is alright, not the greatest, and the tofu soup could be better. So yeah, the food is okay, not too bad. But yes, this place looks like a cafeteria and it was packed with college korean students..why? I don't know..

At the very least, I wish he would have asked me to clarify my order.There are communal tables in the center of the place, which I like but they are merely worn out old folding conference tables.He always has the TV blaring on Headline News.But the food is good, maybe the best Korean on campus.  This is no small feat in a university town hosting 3500 native Koreans.So I added a star for good authentic Korean food, patronized by mostly Korean clientele, but subtracted a star for a surly owner and subtracted another star for crappy interior furnishings.",

I only have a few minor complaints. First, I felt that the food wasn't spicy enough especially considering that it was a Korean restaurant. Even the kimchi was surprisingly bland. Second, there were a few items we ordered that were supposed to come vegetarian but did not and thirdly, we ordered french fries for the kid only to find out that they didn't have ketchup. They shouldn't have french fries on the menu if they don't have ketchup.",

Not only did I visit often, I brought the place lots of business by recommending it to friends or even inviting them there.Been there with my friend yesterday for lunch. Got the bulgogi again.... we didn't even go for the cheaper lunch special option, we paid full price - which is not exactly cheap. Atrocious quality meat - nobody expects fillet mignon in a Korean marinated beef dish, but to have more cartilage than actual meat, making it hard to chew and impossible to swallow, made the experience akin to consuming dog food. The waiter just didn't care, he was a completely untrained young guy who made no effort to help the customers. Nevertheless, the bill included the \"suggested 20% tip\" number, the percentage calculated including the tax as well, which is a bit rich. We paid, we didn't complain, but, given the extraordinary wealth of restaurants Chambana has to offer, Masijta just disappeared from our map.      Definitely a one star experience. I give it two for the sake of the old times. If they don't revise their practices expect this place to close soon.",

My grandmother really enjoyed her dolsat bibimbap, so that was good too. We also shared a seafood pancake that could've been a hair crispier, but otherwise was chock-full of seafood and green onions. I will probably be back next time I'm in the mood for Korean!",

The owner came out to say hi, which was nice.  We will be back to try the tableside barbeque!",

I have only tried spicy items and none have been spicy. On my next visit, I may see if they can kick it up a notch. There is a minimum of two dinners when you want to cook at the grill even though one could feed two people. This is a great spot for a small group or double date. Two dinners is plenty for 4 people and it's a lot of fun cooking your own meat and veg and then adding the toppings of your choice.",

The decor is nice and the location is pretty great considering its near ample parking and just off the major bus stop. However, the food was less than spectacular. My friend got the bulgogi which was cooked thoroughly, but was not especially tasty or well made -- could have gotten a similar dish elsewhere and had it taste basically the same. I had the jjajjjamyun which had a great sauce, but the noodles stuck together quite a bit and the pork was a bit tough. Our server was courteous, and brought us everything we order, so no complaints there. As it is, it's a standard Korean place but for the price, I would have expected a little more.",

Hence, when I first came to Champaign, I was utterly disgusted by the Korean restaurants here; they used msg, had marginal service, and were overpriced. I started cooking just because I needed Korean food now and then and I couldn't bare the restaurants here. But today, I got to taste something different from this newly-opened restaurant called \"masijta grill.\" Their choice of meat for Barbecue was excellent; the meat was fresh and was cut right. The soon-tofu soup with intestines were far from the competitors' in that they actually used properly made stock, instead of the \"msg frenzy.\" The attendents were eager to serve us--I didn't even notice my cup of water being filled up occasionally. They honestly told us how they got the ingredients and asked us how the taste was like each time the dishes came out. I could feel that they wanted to get a good reputation as they are starting their business out and they were quite successful with it. The effort must stay the same, but as of now, when someone asks me if there's any good Korean restaurant in town(or let's say a Korean restaurant that is worth going to), I would pick Masijta Grill with no hesitatioon.",

I think they have the best Sahm-guyp-sahl. Pricey for sure but no one beats their quality cuts.Proceed with caution because you have to spend money to get service. That's why I give them 3 stars. Even if you tip well, this place does not care. I don't know how to get the level of service I expect but it just doesn't happen. But yea, the pork belly, it rocks. You stop caring about the piss poor service once you cook the fatty thing on your table.",

I have been there around 10 times, and I did not have the experience of bad service mentioned in one of 1-star comments -- \"at least 10 minutes to get the menu, 20 minutes to get the water\". Every time I go there, I get a menu as soon as I sit down, and the water comes in a minute. Also, the madam there is very kind.After your orders are taken, you will be served around 10 dishes of really delicious appetizers(which are free). Sometimes I will ask for one more dish of my favorite appetizer(also FREE).If you don't know how to order for the first time, look at the photos on the wall. Those dishes taste really good.Have a nice meal :)",

I used to get the ox bone soup all the time, which was heavenly velvet awesomeness, and they had fantastic barbecue. the Kimchi was always perfectly fermented (which there is an art to, my friend), and every side dish I tried there was fantastic. I never ate anything there that I didn't like.On top of that there was a woman working there, I think one of the owners, who always took an interest in helping us have an authentic experience. As one of the few white patrons at any given time, it was nice to feel like we were welcome to partake of their culture, and she consistently gave us advice on ordering and how Koreans traditionally season or assemble whatever dish we were interested in.What I wanted coming in was a mom and pop place that felt like a window into the food and culture of Korea, without being completely inaccessible to an outsider like myself, and that's exactly what I found.That being said, I was sad that they took jajangmyun off the menu before I got a chance to try it. Then again, this is more of a meat place.",

I've eaten at places in Chicago that did not serve the bibimbop in a stone bowl, so I never knew that stone bowls kept the dish warm for longer and crisped the rice at the bottom of the bowl. This was, however, the most expensive bibimbop I've had ($12.99) but it's worth it in my opinion.I also had a pork dish whose name I do not remember. It might have been M16 on the menu. It was also very good with lots of vegetables and was marinated in the red spicy sauce.I do not give Good Fella four stars, however, because it was hard to capture the waiter's attention for more tea.  In addition, the ventilation in the restaurant is not good so you end up smelling like Korean food when you leave the restaurant.A big plus to this restaurant is that it's the only Korean restaurant in Champaign that has not been subject to a health code violation.",

I would recommend it to anyone who likes korean food. The service was great too. We had the private room at the back. They checked on us consistently.",

He suggested going for a bento box over their \"fusion\" fare because they hadn't perfected it yet....but assured me that the authentic korean fare was spot on.   I ordered the bulgogi bento box and boy was he right!  It was excellent!   I inhaled everything in a matter of minutes.... Not sure what everything was (bulgogi, tempura, rice, a macaroni type of salad and then these gelatinous type of things) but it was great!   I also ordered the kimchi soup and that was great too but it took me a while to finish because it was almost too spicy for me.  Everything came out to $11.  A welcome addition to Champaign!  Thank goodness they replaced Kamakura...that place definitely needed to go!",

                "review": "Giving Yori Q a 4/5 rating with a caveat to be explained later.  Suffice it to say with one exception, the food was excellent and I'll definitely be returning often to eat here.  Review is based upon taste, service, and value metrics.First taste.  We ordered a boodae jungol, corn pahjun, egg jjim, and some spicy dahk bbq stuff.  I'm going to go ahead and mention the \"exception\" mentioned earlier.  Anything on their menu which is a hot plate or whatever, with spicy bulgogi, pork or chicken... I would stay away from all of those items.  Our dahk bbq hot dish thing was an abomination.  The chicken was not cleaned, so we were eating huge pieces of fat, unrendered skin.  And on top of that, they cooked the chicken, but they did not get rid of the grisly cooked chicken blood.  It should be a standard practice to clean the chicken, and once its cooked to skim off any grisly cooked blood so that the customer isn't eating that.  But every mouthful of it is either fat and skin, paired with a goopy, and grisly cooked chicken blood consistency.  It was basically inedible.  I'll go ahead and throw in the value aspect of these dishes as well.  At the 14 dollar price point, everything in that section of the menu is the biggest rip off.  Portion size did not at all justify the price point, paired with the horrible blandness, fat, unrendered skin, and grisly chicken blood... if I could give a 0/5 on the basis of this dish alone I would.  But the fact of the matter is, everything in that submenu of hot dishes is a complete rip off, and until they double the portion sizes of all of those dishes, and remedy their preparation issues, I would stay far away from all of those items.NOW, with that horrible exception out of the way... the good news is, the corn pahjun, egg jjim, and all of the ban chan they gave us was absolutely perfect and excellent.  The Corn pahjun, where it looked WAY overdressed and oversauced, it was actually quite balanced.  A little more acid in the sauce would have been nice, but it was delicious nonetheless.  The egg jjim was more or less a test of execution of a classic ban chan, which they did well.  It was delicious and well prepared.  The boodae jungol was also quite excellent.  I think my defacto standard for boodae jungol is at san soo gab san in Chicago.  And on the basis of taste, Yori Q's interpretation of it was right on par.  It was just enough spicy.  They did put a bunch of \"cheap meat\" in it like spam, and hotdogs, and didn't put any premium meat in it, like chadulbaegee, and put VERY LITTLE samgyepsahl, so it didn't really meet expectations as far as ingredients both in protein and veggies, but it at least tasted good.  So aside from the exception that is that dahk bbq, (which should get a -50 out of 5), I will give the rest of the meal a 5/5.  Very delicious.Service.  Service was great.  A guy named Andrew was our server.  He was excellent, warranting a giant tip.  If you go to Yori Q, request that Andrew be your server, he was excellent, knowledgeable, and friendly.  He will no doubt make your dining experience improve on his demeanor, and excellence as a server alone.  In general the food was ordered, and came out in a short time.  Our server was attentive, refilling our drinks and ban chan, and being receptive to our comments on the food.  5/5 easily on service.Some things they could have done better with our boodae jungol is to cut the ramen noodles, and provided a better array of veggies, and premium meats in it.  The extremely long ramen noodles made it impossible to serve out the boodae into smaller cups without lifting your arm 5 feet above the wok, all the while hot boodae juice is falling and splashing all over your clothes.  Value.  So again, with the hot dishes as an exception, meaning the dahk bbq we got, and every other item in that submenu, I easily give Yori Q a 5/5 on value.  Though I will say, if they do not correct the portion sizes and preparation problems with those dishes the next time we go, their overall rating will drop on this review to a 2/5.  But the boodae jungol was reasonably priced since it was delicious, and the appetizers were not terribly overpriced.  Even with the horrible dahk bbq, our ticket was $52 before tip, which, if you remove the dahk bbq from the equation, it was very reasonable.  So again, aside from the hot dishes, bbq dishes sub menu, Yori Q gets a 5/5 on value.  All in all a 4/5 experience I think.  They will get repeat business from us.  And we'll see if they lower the prices on the hot dishes, double the portion sizes, and correct the preparation issues.  Hopefully I won't be coming back to this review and stamping a 2/5 stars on it.  All things considered, Yori Q is a good place to go, just be sure you ask people what to get before you go, lest you end up with a mouth full of creamy cooked chicken blood, unrendered chicken skin, and chicken fat to eat with your rice.",

After trying all the korean restaurants in town, I must say I was used to having to settle for restaurants with positive aspects and mediocre aspects, food wise, service, ambiance, price. Tried this place twice before leaving and both times I had a great experience. Having lived in Los Angeles I know the standards for korean restaurants pretty well. This place excelled in all aspects. For being a brand new restaurant the service was very attentive and fast, which is unusual for restaurants with training staff. They made sure we were satisfied with our meal. The ambiance hasn't change much since the last asian restaurant in the location but was given a rather simple but clean facelift. Ive tried the spicy chicken stew, naegmyon and other dishes and all of them where very flavourful and generous portions, especially considering other korean restaurants in town. If the service and food quality persist in this restaurant it will definitely be the go to place for everyone in town craving korean food.",

I had the dolsat bibambap for my entree and it wasn't the best. I don't eat a lot of bibambap but this one had way too much rice and not enough stuff. There were also only about 4 or 5 very small pieces of bulgogi. I know bibambap is vegetable focused, but this was just disappointing. The worst part was the fried egg in the bibambap. It arrived at our table with a completely rock solid yolk. Even worse, the bowl next to mine's yolk was not only rock solid, but also broken, leaving a dried up trail around the bowl. Not good. However, the pork neck bone soup was well received and pleasantly spicy. The bulgogi entree was also very good, generous portion of beef to make up for the complete lack of beef in the bibambap. I didn't try the hot pot which they are supposedly known for. I'd recommend this place for bulgogi or soups/hot pot, but I'd stay away from the bibambap.",

Everything tasted great and, most importantly, the service was amazing. I was there for maybe 45 minutes and I was asked if I needed anything at least 6 times.The bad:While everything was great, the bibimbap left more to desire in regards to the bulgogi. It was one of those instances where I felt like I took 3 bites of meat and the rest was rice and veggies. But it was only $10, so can't complain too much. Overall, Yori Q is a great Korean food option in the area and I'll definitely be back eventually.",

On the bright side, their corn jeon is delicious. Also, their seulong tang is delicious. My cousin got the ramen last time and I think they put cheese in the ramen.

The beef hotpot was ok, but overly seasoned with soy sauce and sugar. I remember I had to drinks tons of water afterwards. Second time went for a cheaper choice bearing in mind that sometimes price does not justify quality. However the ricecake hotpot was terrible...excessively spicy, sweet, and was undercooked. ramen and ricecake shall be softer imo.Service was good and I heard many good words about this place. Not sure if I'll try again. Still wanna give a shot though.",

I tried here because my favorite teacher was a friend of the manager, but sorry I'm not going there again. I get why people like it though; a good place to start if you have zero tolerance for the authentic savory Korean flavor and all you need is an instagram photo of 'exotic' food.",

Some might feel this is a bit expensive, but this restaurant didn't take any tips. (or did I forget to give tips?)The system is similar to that of the Spoon house. We order, take a gadget that might ring when our food is ready, wait for the food, take the foods in the tray, and return the trays after finish. So I don't have very much to mention about the service.I was a bit depressed that I do not get any side dishes except a few pieces of Kimchi, but the foods were still very nice and were close to authentic ones.

I ordered Seol leong tang, which is a soup with beef and noodles and costed 10 dollars: the bowl is really big, but besides a few pieces of sliced beef and noodles, 95% of it is just water broth. If you think you can feed yourself on this (plus a small bowel of rice and a side of preserved vegetables), go ahead and try it, but l bet you will be hungry within 2 hours.",

                "review": "Bap Plus is arguably the best Korean place on campus. I've eaten at Woori Jib and Arirang and despite the fact that those places are pretty expensive, the quality and taste has never been very good in my opinion and I've never felt like I've gotten my money's worth when eating there. Additionally, Bap Plus is clean and has a cute interior (very similar to restaurants you'd find in Asia. A close comparison would be to Spoon House's decor.) Essentially, you go up to the register, pick what you want and pay for it then they give you a pager. You bus your own tables and get your own water/utensils. When your food is ready, you can go up to the counter, trade your pager for a tray with your order on it, then bring it back to wherever you're sitting. The plating is really nice and the presentation is simple and well done. You generally get a soup, some banchan (side dishes), and rice with your order. I always get Tonkatsu! The portion is huge and it tastes delicious! (It comes with some sort of fermented radish, miso soup, rice, and a piece of tonkatsu bigger than a person's head with brown ponzu sauce.)Pros:Good portion sizesGood foodReally good maintenance of the interior (not a speck of dirt in sight!)Brightly lit interiorThe tables aren't too close together and you can move them to accommodate more people easilyFast serviceAuthentic foodComfy seatsCons (there aren't a lot, this is me getting super nit-picky):There isn't a lot of variety. The menu has maybe 25 things on it and while those things are solid, I sometimes wish that there were more options!There isn't a rug at the door so be careful of slipping if you're coming in on a rainy day since there's usually a puddle near the door",

I'll be one of these people, but allow me to explain why exactly this rating is as it is with some level of validity. These 3 stars do not mean that it is average by any means, but this is merely my baseline for food that passes. I, as a Korean have had many different types of Korean food ranging from restaurants to my own grandparents, the latter being my personal favorite. While this restaurant does not by my standards make me crave it's food, when I get the craving, it is good enough to suffice. The flavors utilized are by no means lacking, but I have had better. All in all, the food here is good enough to supplement my tastebuds after having been away from home so relatively long, and I would certainly consider this one of the finer Korean restaurants in the Urbana area. If you haven't already, give this place a chance, I'm fairly certain that you won't be disappointed, and if you are, you can blame me for false advertisement. PS: I don't work here, just a customer",

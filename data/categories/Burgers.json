By the time I'm home, the ice cream is melted every time. Very inefficient. If I do go, I only go for the ice cream during the winter when Jarling's is closed.",

The price is a little high for fast food, but it does taste like better quality than the usual fast food suspects: McD's, Arby's, Hardee's. Drive thru service is incredibly slow as everything is supposedly cooked to order. The custard is really good and I love that kids' meals come with a free sundae, any flavor.",

The selection is mainly burgers, and fried chicken, so not much for the vegetarian and vegan crowd.  The food is very \"midwestern\" so if you are looking for a meal that is really interesting to the taste buds, this likely is not the place.I am not sure why people think the price is that awful.  They almost always have coupons in the local advertising magazines.  They also offer a student discount if you show your I Card.  My dinners of a double burger with fries and a soda often end up being $6-$7 which really isn't far from McDonalds or lesser quality establishments' prices these days.I will admit that the burgers are greasy.  The custard is also, well, custard; so it is quite fatty.  However, do you really go to a fast food place to be health conscious?Overall Culver's is a good, reasonable priced option for made to order food with fresh ingredients.",

Their food was typical and not memorable and the beer is only okay. Given the choice, I would choose other bars over Joe's.",

The waitress said they are very busy but the place was at 40% capacity. I understand if things are going slow but the amount of time before we even got our menus was a little ridiculous.Second biggest problem is that nothing comes out at the same time. We had a party of 6 and 4 menus came out, before the next 2. Only 4 waters came out, before the best 2. All of our burgers came out at different times. Also, between each visit from our waitress, there is a long wait.Now the food. I got the California burger with onions rings. The burger was extremely bland, you hardly notice there is guacamole, bacon or basically anything. I'd be shocked if they even seasoned their burger patty. Only thing worth anything was their perfect onion rings. Today they had half off burgers, which is the only reason why anyone should try their burgers. At full price, I'd rather go to Burger King or TGIF.It's also unfortunate that their 2.00 bud light draft special was broken. I thought they'd replace the deal with something else other than can bud-a-ritas...If you really want to try this place come for half off burgers. On a Thursday. I'm thoroughly disappointed.",

I've had most of the burgers without mushrooms. The Bob Marley, Spazzle, Four Twenty, Dick Butkus, and California are some of my favorites. If you're not feeling fries then their mac n cheese is actually pretty good.",

Nobody tipped, and the food was lukewarm by the time she served us. We had to hound her to even pay for the meals. What a horrible waitress. She really should be fired. Both our table and another table of girls never got served until the kitchen almost closed. Yikes...they really need to improve their service.",

I almost always get the Loaded Potato burger, which is great, and their fries are amazing. Occasionally the service is really, really slow, which is a real pain in the neck, but it's not a regular problem. Their drink specials are also pretty good, on par with the rest of Campustown. As long as you treat Joe's like a den of vampires (avoid after dark), it's a nice restaurant.",

In my opinion, the burgers are overpriced to begin with and I'm not sure why anyone would visit here if it wasn't A. \"half-price burger\" day or B. you're just trying to get sloshed with some homies. I've been here a few times and tried their burgers. They're alright. The mac n' cheese side is an upcharge, but it's pretty good, very heavy. Recently, I ordered a veggie burger with no bun (not about to waste my carbs budget on some basic ass bun, ja feel?) and the whole bottom of the burger was burnt and seemed to have something stuck to underside of it. I'm guessing the grill just hadn't been cleaned in a while...If you want a good burger, go to Seven Saints or Destihl. If you're more of looking for a place with a college atmosphere, come on in. This place feels just like your local frat house.",

For traditional patties, you have to choose a 1/4 or 1/2 pound burger. The Mac & cheese isn't necessarily worth the $1 upgrade, so don't bother - unless you want to pay for boxed mac&cheese that has some bacon bits tossed on top. They have a good selection of beers and sodas (be aware that it's not Pepsi *or* Coke products but RC/Dr. Pepper). I thought the draft of Bell's two-hearted complemented my Urbana veggie burger quite nicely. If they'd offered ice cream for dessert, it would have been true love. Also, note that it was very crowded (and noisy) indoors but that they have an extensive patio. There was an upstairs space as well, but they apparently only open that for table service *some* of the time.",

So really, if this is what you're into, then you'd probably love it here, but it's just not for me.The crowd you find that frequents Joe's consists of a lot of scantily clad sorority girls and collar popping frat guys.  If you can manage to maneuver your way through the sea of bodies in the hella hot and humid place and manage to secure a pool table, it can be alright with some friends and a beer.  They do have heating lamps and an outdoor area for if you need some fresh air from the stifling bar, but all in all, I would say Joe's is my least favorite bar on campus.",

It probably had to do with one summer when I had a Temporary Tattoos-day party during 8th grade dance night. The dance floor is where craziness happens and I honestly haven't spent any time anywhere else in that place. But from what I remember, which isn't very much, that alone makes it worth going (but not worth cover, which btw, why did they charge cover this summer? -1 star).Last comment, lol to the review that recommended KAM'S for a \"better time\" than Joes. Joes might have the sticky floors, creepers, and it's fair share of d-bags, but at least it doesn't perpetually smell like vomit.",

Now I know us girls like our privacy, and we ESPECIALLY don't want any guys listening or watching us in the bathroom.  The employees were incredibly rude and were just standing in the ladies room.  I felt extremely violated of my privacy (as any girl would) and when I confronted the employees they kicked me out.  This is not ANY way a girl should be treated, especially when creepy employees lurk around the bathroom listening to girls do their business.

Pretty sure the bartender had to look up and/or ask how to make a dirty martini. They were young tho. Plus not a lot of college kids can drink dirty martinis nor order them.",

I love Steak n Shake, so much that I have to get it at least once every time I'm in town.  Sadly, they don't have one within 1000 miles of Phoenix yet.The food is great, especially the double steakburger (instead of ham, they call it steak you see) platter special that also includes a generous helping of shoestring fries and cup of delicious chili (some of the best around!) To make it better, both me and my grandma ate for under $10... which is cheaper than a lot of bad fast food places.I'm not a big milkshake person, but everyone I know loves them here as well.  Took off one star because the tomato was kind of bad and my waitress was grumpy... but the food is always great!",

What strikes me as odd is the way there is always a huge kitchen staff but the wait staff can be so slow at time. It makes me wonder how much more efficient could be. Usually, it's really difficult to flag down a server to get another drink or to even take your order. Even after your order is placed, it can take up to 20-25 minutes for the food and drinks to come out. On top of that, it feels cramped in the place. I'm not a huge fan and will only go when others want to go, but even the food isn't great. I'd prefer a burger from Zelma's or Wendy's or Chili's over Steak 'n Shake.",

Food itself was surprisingly good. Restaurant was dirty all over-nasty & gross. My younger guy refused to sit in the chair because it was so dirty. I had to wipe it off. Thank God for Clorox wipes! Waitress mopped the floor while we were eating leaving s strange chemical smell in the air again while we were eating. Then she put a \"wet floor\" sign behind a man sitting in s wheelchair, blocking him from being able to get out. The person with him had to get up and move it. Plus milkshakes took longer to get than the food itself!",

Food was quick, cheap, but the staff (aside from my server) was well beyond incompetent.  I felt REALLY bad for the other tables who had to wait seven minutes before the server came to their tables.

The last three times I have gotten it a little later at night (anywhere from 8pm-midnight), it is nothing more than flavored water. The later it gets, the more watered down it seems to be. Last week I got a bowl of broth with maybe 20 beans and 6 chunks of beef. Tonight I ended up with a Western BBQ Double when I ordered a double with pickle and mustard.Quality control is obviously an issue that needs to be dealt with at this location. To be fair, the manager I just spoke to was super nice, took my name and informed me if I come back she will put me down for a free burger (the one I wanted), a bowl of chili and a milkshake. This was really going above and beyond on her end and it was appreciated that she listened to me without interruption while I told her my two experiences and apologized. If she has the power and ability, I believe she will make some changes for the better. It's worth another try anyway; so maybe an update to my post is in my future if they actually give me good service.",

So, now to satisfy my cravings I tend to drive up to the prospect one.  The food, on the other hand, is usually about your average steak n shake fare, so long as you stay away from the shakes, you might enjoy your experience (but who really would want to go to steak n shake and not get a shake?).",

The place was packed with what I think was high school kids and they had like 2 people working the entire floor so I blame management on that.  aside from the fries and shake, the burger I got tasted like it had been in the microwave since vietnam, after having the beef shipped from Somalia.  It was a horrible sandwich and I felt sorry for the poor cow that had to give its life to be turned into whatever the hell they tried to serve me.  Its sad because I remembered liking steak n shakes food.  Maybe this was an off night for the cooks?",

I have never observed any heinous uncleanlinesses, despite the fact that the decor is primarily white and is lit by the most migraine-inducing possible flourescent lights.So, it gets 2 stars instead of 1 for being well kempt and having a waitstaff that is WAY more patient with late night hysterical student milkshake procurement than I could ever have imagined possible, but loses that third star because said milkshakes, once procured, taste like they have had 10 pumps of sugar syrup injected in and the frenchfries I ordered to go with said milkshakes tasted like they had been fried in grease that was maybe 36 hours past due to be replaced from the ol' fryer.",

I would chose any other Steak & Shake in the area than this one.  They are always crowded, under-staffed and slow.  The seating is strange, too many 2 top tables that they don't use for 2 people...The wait staff seems to be overworked or under-managed most of the time.  Always waiting to be seated, waiting...for food or shakes, waiting to get the bill, waiting at the front to pay.  Its a pain in the neck and I LOVE the food so I deal with it, but I hate this particular restaurant.",

I sometimes go through the drive through in the morning to grab some shooters for everyone at work.  We really like the bacon, egg and cheese shooters. They are little and make you think that you are eating less of an unhealthy breakfast sandwich.  So you feel pretty good about yourself to start the day.I noticed they had a taco salad for $3.99 on the menu and I just had to try it.  I really liked it.  It was the right size and price!!However, the chili here has a lot to be desired.  I have had chili at Steak n Shake before and it was OK but here it was gross.  It was really thick and chalky.  Like it was heated up many, many times.  So don't order the chili from this Steak n Shake.",

The last time I went in there I waited by the abandoned cash register for 5 minutes while two workers chatted nearby. They didn't acknowledge me in anyway. When the cashier came she was friendly but was rushing to multitask while her coworkers chatted away.EDIT: They have a value menu now that is still kind of expensive, but I still give this place 2 stars.EDIT 2 (April 2014): This Wendy's now has the regular dollar menu (small frosty, crispy chicken, chili, nuggets, etc.). I'm guessing they did this to compete with the McDonald's that will be opening around the block in a few months. It looks like they have replaced some of their old workers with new ones that are more friendly. I go here every once in a while now. 3 stars",

I went to the 1st window and the cashier said, \"You got Daily Double, no onion, pickle or mustard?\" No, I got the Daily Double with all of the fixins-- thanks for assuming *rolls eyes.* I get my order and I realized that I got the wrong drink. Instead of getting a Sprite, I got a Coke. I quickly walked back over and asked them if I could quickly get my Sprite. The worker was less than nice and took his sweet damn time getting me a Sprite. All along I saw what I believed to be a regular Sprite right in front of me. I asked him if that's mine and he's like, \"uhhh...no.\" So I get my cup, totally relieved-- then I noticed that the cup felt light. I opened the cup to see that it wasn't even filled all of the way and with little ice and no bubbles. Hmm...a clear liquid with no bubbles; does that sound like Sprite to you? No, and it wasn't. It was water (not even cold too). So now I am pissed because I told this punk politely for Sprite at least TWICE. So I go into the restaurant and get it replaced. Then the manager asked me if I got my order and I said yes. Now I'm thinking that my meal is also wrong. I go back into my car to find they did give me the wrong meal. I went back into the restaurant FOR THE THIRD TIME to get my meal. All awhile customers are pitying me saying, \"They really screwed that up, didn't they?\" No fucking shit.By the time I ate my burger, I lost my apetite.The competency of this staff is beyond disappointing. I am definitely going to another McDonalds if not another restaurant because of this.",

At dinner there was no one dining in which should have raised a red flag. It was effortless to order because there was no line. From my vantage point I question the cleanliness of this restaurant. There was a large mosquito flying around the lights in the kitchen, the sun room appeared to be flooded with a sign saying closed and a large puddle of water on the floor. This made me nervous with how dirty the restaurant was... Overall the booth's were simply sticky. The food itself wasn't bad, the mushroom and swiss burger was a bit on the salty side. The fries were fresh though. Overall this was my first and last experience with Hardee's.

They told me they were out of chicken tenders (?) so I'd have to order something else. Pass. I've been avoiding it ever since.Yesterday, boyfriend and friends wanted Hardee's. I figured it was time to let bygones be bygones, so I went to Hardee's and ordered the three-chicken-tender combo basket with curly fries and a drink. The girl behind the counter was efficient but rushed, which is kind of what I expect from fast food employees, so I'm not really fazed by that. My friends were already seated and served, so I filled my beverage and sat with them. I made sure my number was prominently displayed near the edge of the table, as directed.Boyfriend finishes eating basically as soon as I sit down. This is normal.Friend A finishes his burger about five minutes later. Still no sign of my food.Friend B finishes her meal. By now it's been ten minutes. Hmm.I notice that people who were three spots behind me in line have been served and have FINISHED at this point.I check my receipt. It's been fifteen minutes. My friends need to get back to work. I flag down the next passing employee, who happens to be the manager. I ask him what had happened to my food. Manager disappears, comes back three or so minutes later. Apparently the person who put my tenders in to cook forgot to set a timer (??) and they burned, so rest assured, they were going to make me new ones and they should be ready in another five minutes or so.No.I tell him to cancel my order and give me a refund. He was sincere and apologetic, which I appreciate, but at this point I had been in the restaurant for over a half an hour with no food. I'm patient for the most part, but there was no offer to comp the meal, just.. \"Hey, keep waiting and we might feed you in another few minutes. Maybe!\" I understand that they may have been understaffed and that it was the lunch rush, but how no one noticed that one order wasn't filled for 15 + minutes just boggles my mind. I took the money from my refund and went next door to Taco Bell, where I was served terrible but tasty food very promptly and with much kindness. I really love the Taco Bell on Neil. It's clean, friendly, and the girl who works the register during lunch is awesome. I even make substitutions and deletions to my order, and they have NEVER gotten it wrong. So, the moral of this story, in short - save your time and money by skipping Hardee's and go next door to Taco Bell.",

I check in like I normally do on the Hardee's app to get my points and now was at 1100 however the girl at the register was so rude and refuse to take it saying she need the paper coupon, ah hello it's a Hardee's app and it says give to agent at register to use the code and she said I don't know how to do that and \"my drawer ain't gonna be short!\" Insert rude attitude! The worst I never had a problem with this in the past. Also when I asked the coke zero was out she said we ain't got any. If they had run out wouldn't just put a sign up? Nope just to lazy to change it. As well no napkins in dining room at all!",

The drive through wait was longer than I had expected but not the worst.  I get to the window and I pay for my order and I hear the lady at the window specifically ask the person who handed her the bag if there was ranch dressing in it and a fork and the person told her yes.  She said she was just checking to be sure they were there.  I get back to the office and yes there is a plastic fork but no, there is NOT any dressing.  Clearly the person lied about putting it in the bag.  Sadly, that makes my review even worse because now I am eating a salad with no dressing and quite frankly I don't think it's very good this way!!Aside from not having any dressing the salad itself is warm.  I prefer a crisp cold salad like most people.  However, the ring of onion on it is very hot.  Whew!!  The hot ham and cheese is the same old hot ham and cheese they have been serving for years and I still like it.",

He puts on one of the girls sunglasses and continues to cook. Then he gives them back and plays with he key chains. Then cooks again. Never washing his hands and never wearing gloves. Then I see our waiter come out of the back eating food as he is getting our drinks, meanwhile no manager in site. Finally after about 20 mins the manager Lewis comes out of the back for just a bit to talk to a couple waitresses and drinking margaritas the night before. This place is a total joke!!!!",

Also, the coffee only comes in small cups. I wanted a 20 oz. jar of rocket fuel, but settled for 12 oz. of undrinkable ash.Service was friendly and fairly fast. I could not bear to give this less than 2 stars based upon only reviewing one menu item, but if this was a coffeehouse serving this hot garbage, it would be a one star.",

The table of 6 sitting next to us mentioned they had been waiting for close to an hour, and 5 of the six were just about done with their food and one person was still waiting.  We said forget it, and went next door to Cracker Barrel and got seated & our food very quickly.  It appears that the other reviews for this location are similar to what we experienced.

Mistakes are fairly rare but it's worth checkin your food before you leave if using the drive through. The one major issue with this Wendy's is it's ridiculously over complicated and unnecessary parking lot and drive through layout. Not only does it result in wasted space and not enough parking spots, but the radii of the corners and lanes are far too tight for most cars to make without a 3 point turn. It's a brand new building and unfortunately will need renovation soon. Otherwise a good Wendy's with friendly staff.",

I love the Texas Ranch burger (bacon, cheddar, BBQ), and the option to add a fried egg with the Cajun Sunrise is top notch! Also, the awesome soda machine and delicious chipotle flavored ketchup are fantastic additions! My only complaints are that sometimes my burger is a touch too greasy, and the cost is maybe $1 or so more than I would think appropriate. But never enough to prevent me from looking forward to my next visit!",

But the cashiers were speedy and maybe the customers were decisive as well. The concept of this place is similar to that of Chipotle--you pick what toppings you want on your burger or you can choose one of their predefined burgers.  I went with the second option and ordered the californian with regular fries and a drink which came to a total of just under $12.  Kind of a lot for a meal at a fast-food like place but I was hungry so whatever. My meal was pretty good and there was a ton of fries in the \"regular\" portion.  They were thin and crispy as well which I loved.  The burger itself was good, it did fall apart a little bit when I tried to eat it, but there were a good amount of toppings so that was predictable.  I was disappointed in the amount of cucumber wasabi on my burger as I was really looking forward to that.  I feel like I only tasted it in one bite.  Instead I just added some of the specialty spicy chipotle kethcup available which was delicious and this is coming from someone who doesn't even like ketchup and eats her fries dry.  They also have Coca-Cola freestyle machines were you can pretty much have any Coke drink imaginable so that's cool. It also means the person in line behind me gets irritated because I like to check out all of my options before making a decision.",

We regretted it as soon as we took the first bite.The burger here was greatly unimpressive and meat itself was mostly tasteless. I like it when I have a rich beefy taste to the burger patty, but this one did not have a trace of it. (so much for advertising the beef ... ) The burger was dripping with grease and it soaked the bun with the grease which made it soggy. Needless to say, eating became a messy ordeal. For two burgers, drinks, and fries (regular and cajun) we spent nearly $22!!! I was thinking this was gonna be the best burgers I've had, but it was a huge let down. I'm not coming back for sure. Much too expensive, burgers AND fries were subpar. Even if it was cheap, I would pay more for something that actually tastes good. At least the people were nice. Decor was very modern and clean. Oh and they had the new coke machines. But those things wouldn't be any reason why I would come again.",

Normally I like to try a place a couple times before writing a review but I will not be getting anything else from this place.My girlfriend's coworkers got take-out from here and she got a burger and a sandwich for me.  Her burger had avocado, lettuce, and tomato.  My sandwich was an ALT - avocado lettuce tomato on white bread.  So there was similarity.When we got it, the paper around both sandwiches was soaked through in grease and translucent.  This is not, in fact, necessarily a negative.  I didn't get food from a burger place to eat healthy.  I love seeing the grease on the wrapping paper from Derald's on their breakfast sandwiches.My sandwich was disappointing.  It had enough avocado - once I could find it in the almost half cup of mayonnaise on the sandwich.  The lettuce was iceberg lettuce and uninteresting.  The tomato was okay.  The bread was just white bread, fried in some kind of cheap vegetable oil.  That made the sandwich much \"heavier\" and unpleasantly greasy.  Like I said, I don't mind some grease, but this stuff tasted cheap and stale.  After eating it, I felt kinda sick later in the day.  My girlfriend's burger had much less avocado.  The patties were extremely thin and bland.  The bun wasn't great either.  For all they talk about fresh ingredients on the website, I am not seeing the quality reflected in the food.The prices aren't cheap, either - $5 and up even for veggie sandwiches and up to $10 for burgers.  Fries are extra - so we didn't get any, but I hadn't heard good things about them.  Compare this to Black Dog, where you get an awesome burger and fries or other side for $8.  Or Derald's, where the burgers are much cheaper and the veggies look more freshly sliced.  If you must eat at a chain, try Culver's, even that's a much better deal, I think.Since we got take-out I can't comment on the restaurant itself.  I would still never get food from them again.Edit: a note on this review.  After it had been up for a little while, I was contacted via Yelp message by someone from Meatheads.  They apologized profusely for my dissatisfaction and offered me a complementary meal in the future.  I haven't taken them up on it - I'm still not in a huge hurry to go back - but they are trying to address unhappy reviews, and I think that's worth noting.",

The burgers here are hand-formed which is a big plus for me and the fries are cut fresh -- another huge plus!!   I ordered a l'il meathead which is a single burger with lettuce, tomatoes, ketchup, grilled onions and jalepenos!  The jalepenos are super-fresh green.... not the kind that sit in brining liquid for years.   The lettuce was crisp, but a little yellow and everything was super fresh.  You order at the front, they give you a number, you sit down, and then they bring you your food in about 5 minutes!  They also have this crazy cool touch screen soda machine so you can have custom-made sodas like Fanta Grape/Pip/Sprite/Diet RootBeer or some other weird concoction.   Anyways, I ordered cajun fries which were super crisp and had just the right amount of kick!  I have no complaints about this place so far!!!   Way better than Five Guys (I don't think I'll ever like their burgers and thank goodness they aren't in Champaign)!  Meatheads is probably the best fast food burger in C-U,  but not as good Farren's or Black Dog.  I paid a little over $8 for a lil meathead, cajun fries and a drink!",

I'd argue that the food is better tasting than most sit-down burger places in C-U. Perhaps more importantly to someone as dorky as I am is that they regularly cycle their Chef-inspired burgers off the menu, but they'll still make them; as a result, I've literally been ordering from the \"secret menu\" for months. Ask for the Goulden with Cajun fries--you won't be disappointed!",

There's really not much else around on that strip of Neil St. besides other chain restaurants.I had it for the first time the other day on my way out of town and got the Californian, a burger with avocado and this amazing wasabi cucumber sauce. It was pretty tasty. Definitely not lean by any means, but hey, it's a freaking burger.I will say that I did really like the little high school football scoreboard on the wall. I appreciate the interest in community. The servers were really nice too and the fries were pretty good. The soda machines were also brand new and had lots of options... and all it was a very clean, nice little place.However... I still have a couple suggestions:-Add truffle fries. We have them at every decent burger place up here in Chicago (I'm a Champaign native though fyi) and I think it just legitimizes the fact that you're paying for more for \"just a burger\". Plus they're freaking delicious.- Add turkey burgers, or bison, or venison or something. A turkey burger is easy, and delicious, and leaner and I know I'd get it.",

He later invited us to please give them a second chance. So on the 2 June we did and the staff and the cleanliness had not changed still top end. But the food, it did change for the better our burgers and fries and chicken sandwich were all cooked and put together very well. Unlike last time this time my burgers were juicy with nice flavor and had the toppings I ordered, the chicken was hot juicy and well seasoned, the fries hot and fresh still a little heavy on the salt for my taste but nothing like last time, we ate them all this time. Maybe I'll ask for them with no salt next time. Over all a big impovement and we will be going back, hope there is no backsliding. We went at similar times both trips about 3:30p.m. on a Sunday and a Saturday very slow both times so it did not get better or worse do to number of customers",

It was packed, but we received friendly greetings from the staff (GM and owner(s)? were there). The restaurant has counter service, where you order your burgers and then go to your table while everything is made to order. We each got 1/3 lb meatheads (there is also a 1/2 lb and kid's option) and a large fries to share. There are many premium toppings available to add to your burger for free (roasted red peppers, sauteed mushrooms, grilled onions, sauerkraut), while cheese, bacon, avocado, and fried egg (!) cost a little bit extra. I got a handful of standard toppings, and the boy got everything. Our food came out in ~5-6 minutes. The fries were fantastic, crispy with the skins left on. A large ($3) is enough to feed two hungry fry-loving grad students. A sign says that these are cut fresh daily... filling the C-U void for decent potato fare. As far as the burgers go, I quite liked that I could taste the beef through the toppings. The burger ($4.50 + $1 for cheese) was greasy to hold (on the outside of the bun and also dripping from the burger itself), but everything tasted clean and I didn't feel like I had been salt bombed afterward. The bun was soft and sturdy.. appropriate for the type of toppings offered. My burger did not go slip sliding away. Meatheads also offers several dipping sauces (for fries or to be added on to burgers), handspun milkshakes, and two freestyle coke machines. The food is satisfying and tasty (craveable? perhaps), the location is clean and bright, and the people are friendly. Welcome to the neighborhood!",

I have never felt so rushed or pushed to finish my meal as I was tonight at Meatheads. It was ridiculous!

Didn't try the fries, but I enjoyed the Cajun Sunrise burger, though I might recommend it without Jalepenos, as it overwhelmed the taste of the burger.It's a little pricey, and there are definitely better burgers out there, but not bad.I would give this place a 3.5 but I'll round up due to balance out some of the strange negative reviews about the menu and greasy food.  Yes, they have only burgers, and yes, burgers are often greasy.",

They have great toppings that don't cost anything extra when creating your own burger. If you're not sure what would be good, they have some favorite creations that you can choose from that are all pretty solid. If you have kids, they have a reading program where your child(ren) can get a free burger every time they read 5 books! Wonderful program and this is where we do a lot of dinners with friends from school.",

Every single time I go, the servers and cashiers are incredibly kind and welcoming, not just to me but to everyone. I've come in exhausted from long journeys or long days of studying and had the cashier ask how I was doing and check on me later to make sure everything was okay. I've done work in the booths (when its not busy, of course) and listened to podcasts while I ate, so it's an easy place to hang out and relax if you want. The decor is modern and clean, which is always a plus, with nice, soft lighting and it never gets too loud.The food is pretty delicious. I love both their chicken sandwiches and burgers, and with fries I flip-flop between original and cajun because their so tasty. I always get the Californian for its fresh, crisp taste and everytime I ask for no tomato, they always remember (which is more than I can say for other burger joints). The fact that they have those ultra-soda machines is also pretty nice (as I love ginger ale and almost no restaurants in town have fountain ginger ale).I like that the store is also more community/high school oriented than college oriented. As a grad student at the university, I get that the majority of businesses make their haul on the income of college students but Meatheads chooses to focus on the other members of the community. They have a scoreboard for local student sports and even have discounts for high school student, which I think goes a long way in creating the vibe of the restaurant. Overall, a delicious and community-oriented restaurant that serves that homey feeling in all the right ways.",

I wished they would toast the bun slightly to make it fit.\"It's basically an okay Five Guys\" says my friend.  It isn't the best burger around.  I was hoping for better meat, and a big honking patty over two stacked slim slices of meat.   I gave it three since 11 dollars for the full meal is a lot for just an alright burger.  I will try it again, and recommend it to anyone who wants to try that \"upscale\" burger joint.",

Every time that I have been there, the prices are right next to each item on the menu. It is a little expensive but maybe these are the prices this restaurant needs to keep it going, employee and compensate good personnel and god help them, make a profit.

The best description would be GREAT selection of toppings on an extremely ordinary and virtually tasteless hamburger patty, and a Wonderbread bun. I mean, the bun was really disappointing ... My girlfriend and I each had a burger - no fries and no drinks - and it came to $12. With fries and drinks it would have been $20.  Seriously, I would have been more satisfied with a McDonalds or Burger King hamburger - maybe not so fancy but half the price ...Honestly, I would never go out of my way to return to this restaurant, and anybody who recommends the burgers at this restaurant as anything more than mediocre has really questionable taste in food ...

My husband still thinks that the Courier has the best burgers, but Meatheads blew the competition away for me. You get a larger portion of excellent tasting beef for the price. Every burger has at least two patties. Nearly everything about my regular meathead burger was perfect. The only room for improvement is the bun...but it wasn't bad at all--just not as gourmet as the rest of the burger. They have lots of fancy options. My husband really liked his Cajun Burger (although it was pretty messy to eat!) The fries are fresh, cut thin with skins on, and also served in large quantities. I have yet to try the shakes because Custard Cup is right down the street...The ambiance is casual and clean--a wide variety of songs played, not too loudly. There's plenty of seating and room to spread out, although I have seen it get pretty packed. This would be a great place to come with a big group because you could easily push tables together. They give you a number so that you can sit down after ordering and wait for a server to bring your food. The food comes very quickly. They also have the world's most high tech soda machine, with a touch screen menu of more than your average options. There's a drive through as well.Obviously eating here costs more than a fast food place would, but it tastes so much better. You're not eating pink slime, chemicals, fillers, or trans-fats, and it's obvious. It's still cheaper than eating out at a \"sit-down restaurant.\" Tonight, my husband and I spent $16 for a filling meal for two and didn't have to tip anyone. When I'm in the mood for a burger at a casual place, this is where I will go.",

When I got my order, I got a heaping order of fries. They were separate from the chili, cheese, onions, and jalepeno peppers which were in small containers. They're not McDonalds kinds, more like Five Guys (with the skin on it), which I am not a fan of. Alone, the fries were bland and underwhelming. They were also not super fresh. The cheese sauce was okay (I was expecting something similar to nacho cheese), and the chili was actually pretty good, though, given the amount of fries I had, I was surprised at how little I got.It's definitely not something that I would order again, though I'd love to try a burger there.",

I will be going back, but it's still a bit pricey to be my main choice of restaurant. Still, I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good burger.Also, this time I noticed how involved Meatheads was with the community. They had a wall devoted to the sports for the high school's in the area. I thought that was a great idea. Just a side note.",

The total was about $9, so I expected a burger and fries for two, and the portion was huge. It looked really good, with fries overflowing the basket. The burger looked great...until I took a bite. I waited for some flavor, but it never came. On to the fries. Fresh cut, looking good...but tasted burnt. I was sitting close to a couple who I overheard discussing the food, and their thoughts were the same. The burger was tasteless. On my second visit, I ordered a Chicago Dog and fries. The dog was a footlong, but it also didn't have the snap or the meat flavor I expect in a Dog named Chicago. The fries were the same, huge portion, burnt tasting.C'mon, Meathead's, man up. What's with your beef? It's can't be that hard to buy beef worth the prices you charge. When I occasionally eat at Mac's, I get a double with nothing on it, and even at Mac's, the beef flavor shines through. Five Guys will be here soon, and I'm hopeful we'll have a great burger in town. But I'm not counting on it. \"Under promise, and over deliver.\" I think with franchise prices what they are, corners are often cut.",

At this point, Meatheads has been open in Champaign for over a year and a half, so I expect most of their kinks have been worked out, and my experience is fairly standard. I'm still not impressed. Sorry, Meatheads. I wanted to like you. This time, I ate in the restaurant. It was a Thursday, shortly after noon. The restaurant was busy-ish; not packed, ample seating options, but doing some good business. I ordered a similar burger to my first - a cheeseburger with fresh avocado, and I split an order of fries with Husband. I also got a soft drink, because they have the Coca-Cola Freestyle machines. I have a soft spot for those machines. I don't drink a lot of soda, but there's something that appeals to the kid in me when I can make a strawberry Sprite! ANYWAY.Pros - Customer service while ordering. The cashier was friendly, efficient, and got my order right. Drinks - Again, love those Freestyle machines. Way to go.Mehs - Fries. I didn't not like my fries. I also wasn't blown away. They were fine.Cons - The burgers are just *too* greasy. I'm sorry. Maybe some people like that, but I don't appreciate an active stream of grease dribbling off of my sandwich. The bottom bun was soaked with grease before I even had a chance to take a bite. The burgers just aren't up my alley.Price - The burgers aren't very big considering the price. I still think it's a little steep for what you get, especially compared to some of the other burger options in town.Customer service while eating - There were at least three staff members making regular rounds. This is good - if you need something. I don't like the feeling, however, of being rushed, and as soon as anyone picked up the last fry/burger bit/etc from their tray, a staff member would swoop down, ask a hurried \"Areyoufinished\" and grab the plate. This unnerves me. Also, Husband wanted to use his burger plate for a ketchup rest for his portion of the fries, but as the staff member had already grabbed his plate, he let it go. Is this a huge deal? No. Is it kind of.. rude? I felt so. I appreciate that the staff is trying to be helpful, but the constant circling is off-putting.I realize I may be picky, so I encourage anyone who is curious to give Meatheads a try. I did ask, again, for my dining companions' opinions, and they also weren't very impressed. Husband had been with me before, but we were dining with a friend who had never gone - in fact, it was his desire to try Meatheads that convinced us to go back and give it another try. None of us are planning a return trip. YMMV.",

They give Five Guys (heck, a lot of the bars) a run for their money, and in terms of \"fast food\" type joints, I've only had one or two better. The soda machine with the unlimited options is always cool (though I don't recommend the Peach Mello Yello Zero, both because it's not as good as it sounds and it probably shortens your lifespan by five years). Plus the decor is neat- I like that they list local sports scores on the wall, and the place is bright.The problem is that the place is so darn expensive. It's normally $12-$15 for a burger, fries and a drink, and while you get a lot of fries, they're the shoestring ones, so you don't get as many as you think. It also takes a bit of time for a pseudo-fast food restaurant, and while the toppings selection is diverse, it's not like it's super-diverse.",

We had the Chili Cheese Fries and they were delicious.  I think the previous reveiwers who had Take Out...maybe didn't get the full experience like you do with dining in....because I would rank the Chili Cheese Fries at top of my list.  I had the Texas Ranch burger and enjoyed every bite.  We also had a Mocha Shake which was very rich and delicious, though my husband thought is was very \"coffee\" flavored (um, that's the point I thought but was happy to drink more of his share).Oh, and I love the fancy soda dispensers ...they are the electric ones where you can choose a flavor to go with your soda choice...totally fun.",

You can get a cheaper burger at Culver's but their french fries are gross so if you are going for the whole meal thing this place would be your best bet.

I order the 1/3 meathead burger with American cheese, ketchup mustard, pickles and bacon. Jason ask me if I wanted fries but I had to pass. I ask for an orange soda because that was one of the options on the menu. Then Jason ask me what kind fanta, church, ect. That's when I realized that meatheads had the big soda machine. So I request a strawberry lemonade. Drove to the window got my food and went home. The burger was good. I felt like it was missing something one it but I couldn't put my finger on it. Maybe I needed more toppings. But I had a great experience and will be back.",

I had the Hawaiian - Pineapple, Jalapenos, cheese, and bbq sauce I think. It was much better - my burger was a lot less greasy, and it stayed together quite well. I got the Cajun fries again, those were pretty good as well. I went again with a large group (7 people) and the staff saved a table for us while we were in line. That was awesome, since it was pretty crowded on a Saturday night.Pros: Tasty burger. A large fry is plenty for 2 people to split. Not overloaded on cajun flavor. Staff was excellent again. I didn't get a milkshake, but they looked kinda expensive for the size (but supposedly they taste pretty good).Cons: Fries were alright. I had a lot of little pieces in the order I split with a friend.Overall I had a much better second experience at Meatheads. I would recommend that you try one of the chef inspired burgers! I can say that I will come back here again.",

The meat didnt really have much flavor, and the sandwich pretty much fell apart. I will say the ingredients were very fresh, and they give you a ton of fries. Easily could split a order between two people. The coke machines are pretty cool and was more memorable than the food. I'll give this place another try sometime, but for the price, it won't be a regular go-to place.",

I've been here on three occasions, hoping that I was just missing something.  Unfortunately, It's just not that good. As others have mentioned, the staff really seems to try and are friendly.  The atmosphere is as expected.  Sort of an industrial/modern atmosphere with lots of wood.  It's a new facility, so it's clean and tidy in upkeep.  Can't fault any of these items.But then there's the food.  Burgers, fries, drinks and  shakes.  Pretty much that's it.  There is a selection of theme burgers and a build-your-own option.  First time I went I had the basic Cheeseburger.  It came promptly in a basket with a pile of fries.  The burger was covered in so many toppings that it was really just a topping sandwich flavored with meat.  Everything was so greasy and sloppy that you really had to eat it with a knife and fork.  Meh, not my thing.  But I figured I'd give it one more chance and try a build-your-own next time.  This wasn't much better. There's just no flavor to the burger and it's a sloppy mess to eat.  I decided to splurge on a shake this time to take with me.  By the time all was said and done, I was out darn near $15.00.  Way too expensive for a burger and fries.  Then, about two weeks ago, I was late to an appointment and needed a quick lunch.  As I mentioned, I really wanted to like this place so I decided to swing in and give it one more try.  Ordered a bacon cheeseburger this time.  Even worse than the first two.  Size and quality had dropped from the first two times, always a bad sign.  Seems like they are starting to cut corners.  Again, dropping $10 for lunch really isn't going to work.  Culver's, on a good day, make a way better burger for quite a bit less.There are a couple new places with this theme opening in the next few months around town.  Let's hope they are an improvement.",

Sometimes you just want cheap food that you know isn't good for you. My personal choice: a cheeseburger and fries. This place NAILS IT. Crispy, delicious fries. Yes, cheese product cheese when you order cheese fries... BUT HOW ELSE CAN YOU EAT CHEESE FRIES?!?! Juicy, well done, charbroiled delicious MEAT (not \"meat\") patties. Solid bun, nothing fancy. American Cheese (because that's how I like it, since we ARE in America). And cheap cheap cheap. I would venture to say my favorite no-frills cheeseburger & fries. Really.My boyfriend and I first discovered this GEM when he was getting his undergrad here probably around 2006. We instantly fell in love with their CHEAP & delicious cheeseburgers and cheese fries. They even have a deal on Wednesdays where you can get a cheeseburger, fries and a drink for $3.99 OR a double cheeseburger, fries, and drink for $4.99... CHA CHING! We were sold. When we left Champaign we used this place as our last meal, we love it that much. And any time we had an excuse to visit, this was always our place. UNTIL... they closed the location near Parkland. Driving past it's boarded up windows was devastating. Many nights were filled with tossing and turning over this loss... until two days ago when we found the new location. We just about got into an accident, we're thrilled!! We moved back two weeks ago because now I am going to law school here, and while we are disappointed with the new location we are both excited for the many joyful meals to come.",

The buns were standard, not the poppy seed variety, and there was no celery salt on the dogs. Even the meat was below average, definitely not a place I'm heading back to even if the special was $5.38 with tax.",

I was informed  that the Chicago Dogs were on special; two Chicago Dogs, Fries and a Drink for $4.99, so I ordered the special.  When I  arrived home I was very disappointed; what I had was two hot dogs on hot dog buns... Chicago Dogs are Beef Franks (preferably Vienna)  on a Poppyseed Bun with green  pickle relish, chopped onion, tomato wedges, dill pickles and sports peppers sprinkled with Celery Salt..  Windy City Express had  some of the right ingredients, but the wrong Hot Dog and Bun, with no Celery Salt...

This place is real bad, really need big house keeping improvments dinning room is dirty. Still gave it a shot, dying for a Chicago dog. The girl taking my and two other costomers order seemed to really have something better to do then wait on us. This is at 12:30 I should have known something was wrong only me and one other guy in the place at lunch time. Seem to be on a down hill slide here. Chicago dog in Urbana 2 hours+or - from Chicago should not be all that hard, but for this place it is impossible. A Chicago hot dog is 1 all beef dog, 1 poppyseed bun, 1 tablespoon yellow mustard, 1 tablespoon sweet green pickle relish, 1 tablespoon chopped onion, 4 tomato wedges, 1 dill pickle spear, 2 sport peppers, 1 dash celery salt.Thats not that hard. Windy city you get the dollar a pack who knows what kind of meat hot dogs you buy at the discount store, and you get it on the 59 cents a package hot dog buns that you also got well you were there. Then you put a few of the things that should be there on, if you get 3 out of 7 you will be lucky.I did ok I at least got 1 little sport pepper on both dogs. One was good, the dog was only about twice its size, so you don't need a lot of them. Once you put half give or take of the stuff that is on a Chicago hot dog on them, you wrap them up let the bun get soggy, and let it all get really cold. Now brake out the onion rings you got at Save Alot, at least they were hot. This place way bad don't even think about it, the cheap dosn't even come close to making up for the bad. So I am a former North Chicago resident living in Champaign county looking for a good dog that will not make me go to campus town.WOW need more reasons not to eat here go to cu-citizenaccess.org and read the Champaign - Urbana Public Health District report on this place.",

The employees recognized me regardless of my alternative mode of transportation and helped me quickly - possibly more quickly than those in motorized vehicles! I ordered the chicken sandwich based on a recommendation. Its basically a big mac or whopper with fried chicken instead of a beef patty and boy did it hit the spot! I will confess that this meal was very greasy. I was craving grease at the moment so it worked out but I don't eat greasy food that often so I did have a bit of a grease induced upset stomach later that night. If you're not craving fat and unhealthy food then I'd probably avoid this place but even us fitness junkies get cravings for unhealthy food from time to time and when that happens, I'd definitely come here.",

Most things are cooked to order (like the hot dogs) and take awhile.I haven't had a Chicago Style Hot Dog this good anywhere else outside of Chicago. Although they don't have the poppyseed buns (very odd), they are still quite fantastic. And only two bucks!In general, Windy City is priced competitively. I've had almost everything on their menu once. Everything is priced competitively and tastes good to great--except, oddly, their default hamburgers. The meat is fine but I don't like the way they dress it with only ketchup, mustard, and grilled onions. I will ask them to put plain (raw) lettuce, onion, tomato with ketchup and mayo on it instead (traditional burger setup) and they are perfectly happy to do so--much better.Side note: Also highly recommend the Veggie Pita. Awesome value for a great tasting non-meat alternative.",

One was for no date on portioned salad dressings.  I assume \"portioned\" refers to when you pour dressing from the main container into a secondary container for daily use.  The second was for putting fish and fries at convenient locations during lunch rush.  The third was something about the ice drain line, fourth  was some air gap issue with the drive through window, and the last was for a bag of ice melt being stored on the same shelf as food.  When I see a score of 31 I expect there to be spoiled food, dirty/sick employees, rodent infestations and the like.  These are hardly reasons for me to stop enjoying my guilty cheap burger and fry pleasure.  With the previous rant review addressed this place is the best alternative to fast food burger chains.  I have had their burgers, chicken fries, fried okra (!), and fish.  Their fish is surprisingly yummy and burgers should be ordered doubled and split with a friend.   My biggest complaint is that they don't have root beer or ginger ale.  As a result I never order a drink.",

I'd give the place another chance though, only because it was good food and the wait may have just been a fluke.",

I asked her if I ordered combo and she said yes. I didn't say anything back, but this is really unexpected. When I asked if I ordered a combo, I simply imply that I didn't. Either she just assume that I wanted a combo or couldn't understand English. The fries I got were cajun and I don't remember anything close to the word \"cajun\".

They literally slapped everything together and had the burger leaning one way and the topping leaning another way. the fries were disappointing. When I think of cajun fries I think of delicious thick-cut, crispy fries. Jurassic Grill's cajun fries were  flat, lifeless fries topped the cheapest packet of cajun seasoning they could find. I didn't eat my fries, and I'm not a very picky eater. Some of their burgers come in the \"T-rex\" version, which will get you an extra patty for a dollar. You get to choose from a good number of basic \"Free Toppings\". It would be nice to have a selection of premium toppings like avocado, portabello mushrooms, bleu cheese, etc. Also, they have a cool theme, so it's beyond me why they don't use it to expand their small menu. They could have a burger topped with guacamole, lettuce, red onion, and pepper jack and call it some like the Guaca-saurus Burger. Their menu places so much info on their free toppings, but ketchup, mustard, onions, etc is not unique enough to keep me coming back to this place for an ok tasting burger.A lot of untapped potential at this restaurant.",

Every time I've been here the burgers are cooked fresh right before your eyes and the toppings are displayed in a refirgerator in plain sight. There is none of the behind the scenes burger building like you'll find at other places. Price wise Jurassic Grill is comparable to 5 guys or meatheads. The only problems are the lack of seating and the strange hours. Even considering these, Jurassic Grill deserves a five star rating, and then some. When you stop by be sure to say hi to the owner and chat with him a bit if it isn't too busy. The times I've been there he was working the register which shows his dedication. Jurassic Grill is a must-visit for any burger lover, on campus or not.",

The fries on the other hand, were very soft and floppy, I prefer rather crunchy fries. They may have gotten soggy and soft while being delivered? I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and try the fries in the restaurant next time.",

The burgers are good; but when there's just one thing on the menu I expect it to be fabulous, not just an Applebee's-style hamburger. Limited seating and no ambiance just makes it seem like a doomed business. There's nothing \"Jurassic\" about it, and even something to pull the theme into the actual restaurant (big portion sizes, Sauron-shaped fries, ANYTHING!) would help; but it just seems gimmicky. Went once to see what it was about, but there are infinitely better dining options nearby.",

Perfect opportunity!Walked into the store and checked out the menu, which is very straightforward and pretty consolidated. I got a T-Rex bacon cheeseburger with a bunch of my favorite toppings, for a little over $5, which, for the size, and amount of calories, was a steal. The burger was tasty! Nicely put together and blended well with the fresh-tasting ingredients. Didn't get any fries or anything with it. If you're looking for a big, greasy mouthful of 'Merica, this it in all its glory.Overall it's a solid fast burger place, perhaps expensive without the Hooked deal, but I wouldn't quite say the best burger in C-U, either. In my opinion Farren's probably takes that cake.",

A single toy T-Rex sits in front of the menu...and that's it. I'm assuming they are waiting to see how successful the business is prior to investing in decor, not really a big deal at all, just a little disappointing.The Bad:-A serious lack of seating! There are literally eight seats in the entire place! I'm guessing that this is again an issue of waiting to see before investing too much in decor, but there's at least room for one more table.Overall:Definitely worth checking out!

Don't expect anything very healthy here..there are a few salads and a veggie wrap, but all have cheese or dressing (which I guess you could get on the side...).  Onion rings are good, I've heard the mac-n-cheese is tasty, and many of the burgers are on wonderful pretzel rolls.  As a note, they have something called \"haus sauce\", which is just their buffalo sauce, so don't be fooled.  Never been here during peak evening hours, so I can't comment on that, but an ok place for lunch and a beer.",

I felt kind of bad because I was already in a very committed relationship aka married. But really, I wasn't sending misleading creepy signals or being charming either. For the longest time I thought it was the smell of my hair wax I was using to style my bed hair when I would go out to socialize with friends. But I tested this theory numerous times in other cities and no dice. Yes, the wife was not with me at other venues.Investigatively (not a real word)... I think on certain weekends, the local gals come here to find their knight and shining armor to take them away from the small town. But here is the thing, u will never know if she is a local until she tells you. But I came here enough to observe and identify how to spot these rare and undiscovered people. First off, they are extremely beautiful, like the tone of their skin was almost natural and organic... unmanipulated by the city or fake UV rays. They dress differently, no labels and no blig. And here is the kicker, they talk differently. Their topics of discussion are not layered from the dry vocabulary of the bullshit literary material University students are being brain washed in (this includes myself). One big clue seemed to be the type of questions they asked. University girls typically asked questions like what are you studying, where have you interned, what year in school are you? But I noticed the local asked a key differentiating question: where are you originally from?---if you decode this question, it's underlying motive is can you take her away from her boring hometown.Keep in mind, this place is not swarming with these type of treasures. A treasure is a treasure to be found. I write this review because I hope to read or hear about somebody finding their future other half at Firehaus. A smart city kid that swoops a small town gal off her feet and make a ton of babies after graduating.So best wishes to you bachelors, go to Firehaus with new purpose. Cheers! I'll be expecting a wedding invitation shortly. LOL...",

Now what really attracted me today was it's deal! For $4.99 you can get 10 delicious wings that matches that if Buffalo Wild Wings! Of course, the deals do Cary day to day so you may just have to swing by the place very now and them to see if the daily special flows your boat. But when it does, boy is it worth it!The waitresses are extremely fast to react and the food also comes with speed. Their bottles and draft selection are humongous, and their prices are pretty decent too! Definitely checkout the place!",

Based purely on food alone - I give this place 3-stars - it's average. However, it deserves an extra star for its service.

Luckily we stumbled around and found this place open for dinner. Most of the students had gone home for the holidays so it was a perfect fit as this is not really a \"family restaurant\" but a bar with bar food. We ordered the cheese curds which for 5.99 was very little cheese curds and not really that good. They taste like they came from the freezer. The royale burger was a lot burger with double meat patty topped with egg, cheese, bacon, and a pretzel roll. It is definitely not a steak house burger but it was juicy and with good meat flavors. Overall it was good, but not very memorable. The one major plus is if you drink they have quite an extensive bar menu with daily drink specials.Pros: daily drink specials, lots of bar foodCons: the food is okay, I can't say that it is the best bar food I have ever had.

In our time at the Firehaus, we observed an incompetent management team. While the bartenders became busy trying to fill orders for their servers you could see patrons at the bar with empty glasses including ourselves.  Management was sitting at the end of the bar sipping on their sodas and barking orders at employees. At no time did the manager  attempt to help the bartenders and clear their backlog. As we were getting ready to leave we observed a member of the management team chewing out a member of the waitstaff to where she was in tears. This was done in front of a very crowded bar for all patrons to observe. Personally, I think this is a horrible time (middle of a shift) and place (in front of a crowded bar) for a reprimand to occur.   I think their management team is extremely unprofessional and feel for the employees under their leadership.",

We were directed to the FireHaus by quite a few people and were really excited. First I will say our bartender/waitress was amazing and super sweet. Very attentive to us and made sure we got drinks and everything was accurate and super good. The downside is that we put in one appetizer, the pretzel bites.... and then 10 minutes later put in 2 other appetizers and out second order came out first. While we waited we were told multiple times that the kitchen staff misplaced the order and or it got put under another person's order. It took us almost an hour to get pretzel bites, a little crazy. Also we were stuck watching a 21-0 blowout game on one TV while an amazing game (not shown on any TVs) was on. We asked that they change the blowout game and the first guy we asked gave us an answer that screamed \"I don't care enough to make the change for you\". Super disappointing. All in all if/when I get back to Champaign for another game, I will not even have this place on my radar of places to stop at.",

I think that you're tolerable on Mondays, when I can kind of hear myself think, the bartenders are the new ones and not completely jaded, and I can drink cuervo silver margaritas for $3.But Firehaus, my experience with you is generally bad.  The lines are ridiculous, the music is overwhelmingly loud, my friend's credit card got closed out to the wrong person, and had someone else's drinks on it... and his last name is not \"Smith\" or \"Jones\" or anything common.  What You did to get on my last nerve?  Once I was there, and a seasoned bartender dipped a glass in the ice bin, and it came up broken.... which means there was glass in the ice bin.  I pointed it out, and so he got another glass... and dipped it back in the same ice bin with glass in it. Gross.  Their food is OK, but overrated. Bah. Firehaus, I will definitely not miss you when I move away.",

The food is better than most other places on campus as far as bar and grill is concerned. Their best options are half priced wings on Sundays/Mondays, the Hazmat or FDNY wrap (1/2 priced on Saturdays), and their chili. Some things to note are that the waiting staff is usually new during the summer and leading into the fall. Give them some time to learn and adjust to the bar. It can be easy to get aggravated if you're there with a huge group drinking but everyone wants separate checks and the waiter mixes up drinks. Also, the appetizers aren't really worth it omitting the Firehaus fries. Most portions are simply to small for the list price. Side note: When the upstairs bar is open it really opens up the establishment. There is a second story outside deck as well as an outside alleyway (paved and meant to serve as a patio) to sit and dine outside.",

I've been there a few times earlier in the week when it's less crowded, and it's been pretty enjoyable.Last word of advice:  avoid the amaretto stone sours.

I'd eat here probably once a week if not more and switch off between wings, salad, chicken tenders, or spinach artichoke dip. It was all amazing, every time.But sadly, my old stomping grounds have become disappointing.I came here back in May for a random visit and saw they added an AMAZING sandwich to the menu, the Southwest Chicken. Grilled chicken, provolone, pepper and onions, and avocado? YUM. Paired with onion rings and I knew this would be my new go-to on their menu.Flash forward to a couple weeks ago when I came down for Homecoming. My friends and I literally parked the car in a garage a block away and went straight to Firehaus. Ah, the nostalgia! The memories! THE GOOD FOOD!I ordered the Southwest Chicken with a side of onion rings, like I had been dreaming about all day. When it came out I was immediately disappointed to see they had replaced the fresh avocado slices with some sort of avocado PASTE. Yuck! It smelled and tasted bizarre so I scraped it off. Bye, delicious chicken sandwich! Now you are merely of slightly-above-average taste.The next day I came in for lunch, because who actually goes to Illini football games anymore? I decided to get a side salad and wings, and everyone at the table ordered a drink with their food. The waitress brought out everyone's drinks except mine, which I found strange since I had just ordered a bottle of Bud Light Platinum. After another server brought out everyone's food and not mine, I flagged down our server and the look on her face when I asked about my food was one of, \"Oh shit.\" So she ran away and came back a couple minutes later explaining she forgot to put in my order originally. Well, duh, I kind of got that. She apologized profusely and said I'd get a discount on my bill.The wings were worth the wait, honestly, and the salad was as good as I remembered. But then the part where my bill came? No discount. At this point we were rushing off to go to another bar and my friend was nice enough to just pay for my tab, but come on. If you're going to screw up my order and then promise a discount, deliver on it.Maybe I'm just picky, or maybe I expected more from a place I used to frequent. Or maybe it lost its shine. It pains me, Firehaus, but you only get 3 stars from me.",

The Backdraft is a quarter-pound of ground chuck, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and onion. I opted to add bacon to my burger and top it with BBQ sauce. I also subbed the house bun for a pretzel bun to kick this burger up a notch. The result is a mouthwatering combination of sauce, meat, cheese, and bun that is first-rate. If the beef was only a little more flavorful and juicy this campustown burger would be amongst some of the better I've had. Firehaus gets major points for being a campus bar that sports some gourmet grub, great drinks, and a fun atmosphere. If you're ever in home of the Illini Firehaus is a must.",

Honestly, what is the point of maintaining the line that close to closing when the bar itself is not at capacity??Evening:We came here at the end of Fall semester as an organization to celebrate a job well done. Our group of 10 was seated promptly and the waitress did an awesome job in accommodating our group. We came on a Thursday I think which meant $3 burger with AMAZINGGGGGG fries. Their fries are double fried so they have a great crispy crust. On top of that, they have a good selection of beer on tap to complement your meal. Expect to pay more for a pint than for your entire meal haha.So it's quite bittersweet... awesome bar food place turned horrible bar at night? This is life :(",

But now, it's kicking ass and taking names and has a whole lot of loyal customers, and for that, I give this bar all sorts of props.Also, I just said \"props.\" Ew.Anyway, the really excellent thing about this bar is that it is CLEAN. Clean clean clean. Even on Unofficial, which is arguably the dirtiest day on campus all year, the bathrooms at Firehaus will be clean. The layout isn't my favorite as there aren't a whole lot of places to sit, but the beer garden is excellent, and the buffalo chicken sandwich (with pasta salad!) was pretty damned good.Of all the Cochrane bars on campus, this one is without a doubt. the best.",

I've always liked Firehaus but it was never one of my haunts.  I like how they have large tables, and how the front is open-air.  They have lots of daily drink specials, and the atmosphere isn't sketchy.  Dim lighting, very red in there.  Well I guess it is a firehouse.  Despite it \"looking\" nicer than some other campus bars (it's really just that it's newer, I'm sure), you are still going to run into some silly silly people.  Last time we were here, a drunk guy was talking to us and wouldn't leave, so we took his flip flops and hid them in the girls bathroom.  So you know, it's not a total class act of a bar, but it's pretty clean and well-maintaned compared to some of the other options.",

My only, minor complaint was the lack of bartenders making waits for drinks very long (sometimes nearing a half hour). If I come back to the Illinois campus, I'll for sure be stopping at Firehaus for a drink to start the night.",

The Texas Style Fries are like nachos but with crispy fries (refried beans, cheese , bacon, jalapeos) - doesn't sound like it would be good but it's great.  The boneless wings are fantastic and the cheesy jalapeo rice is top notch.   $1.50 domestic drafts on Sundays; $1 drafts on Thursdays and a host of other deals.  I don't know how they make money but I'm happy to take advantage of it.  It's the best place to watch sports since you are so close to a large TV no matter where you sit! I love this place!",

It may not stay that way, but as of now it's very nice. The store is also well run in my experience and even late at night when it gets busy, they seem to stay on top of things. You may not want to, but you know you'll end up here eventually.",

Also how on Earth do you run out of soft serve??? I wanted to order ice cream and was told they ran out...how does that even happen? It's Mcdonalds...you never should run out of anything- it's like a huge endless fridge of food back there.",

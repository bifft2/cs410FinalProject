Oh, and free wifi as well!One star off for their relatively limited hours...only open till 9 M-Sat, and till 5 (ouch!) on Sundays.",

Kopi's is on par for comparison, but I think I like Pekara's more because it's served in a porcelain cup...something about it is more pleasant that way. The bakery is delicious, but the sandwiches are a little too salty/heavy for my taste. The same goes for the soups; tasty, but way too rich and creamy. That's a preference thing and I'm sure many people will like it, but just in case others are sensitive to textures, there it is.Overall, it's not a super-special kinda coffee shop, but for downtown Champaign, it does well, and its a local business with awesome staff that I feel really good about supporting. I also think it trumps downtown urbana shops by a long shot; looking at you Flying Machine.",

If I try and go on a diet, bread is one thing that I cannot give up. I love it so!!  Pekara is now my go-to spot for bread at the market. The wide selection of bread and baked goods immediately catches your eye. In a glass case, there are croissants and other goodies.  Next the case is a table filled with fresh baked breads that all look mouthwatering. I have purchased the Herb Focaccia and the Baguette.  Woah, both were amazing!!! The Focaccia had the perfect amount of rosemary and salt on it and it was perfect for dipping in some olive oil with parmesan cheese.  The baguette had a rustic look to it and had the right amount of crustiness.   It went great with the Italian Wedding Soup I made for dinner that evening. The gentleman at the stand is also very nice and I will for sure be a regular customer from here on out! Thanks Pekara!!",

With that said, there's also a lack of upscale cafe/bakeries in general in the area so it's not a bad place to visit for breakfast if you're around.",

                "review": "First, the things Pekara does well. I frequently encounter quiche with an unappetizing dense, crumbling texture, so I was absolutely over the moon when I discovered Pekara's quiche lorraine--instead of a piece of dried-out egg cake, the filling is so superbly soft and velvety that it literally melts in your mouth. At the Urbana farmers' market, I'll stop by their stall and pick up a filled croissant, which are always crisp and flaky beyond belief (not the sad, soggy pastries that croissants can sometimes be). I also crave their savory roasted red pepper and Gouda soup--but I bet they buy it packaged from some wholesaler as I've eaten nearly identical versions at several other places in town.Next, the things I'm not so happy with. One morning I decided to stop in and pick up some treats for my workplace's coffee hour. Thinking it'd probably be a good bulk investment, I opted for a loaf of the pumpkin bread, which came out to more than $10. I've been able to pick up a loaf at other bakeries in town for around $5, so I was admittedly shocked, especially because the bread was very dry and not particularly special in any way. Some of their baked goods are fairly inconsistent in quality--so much that I've sometimes wondered if they switched owners/bakers. Recently, they've made attempts to introduce some of the classic items you'd see in a New York Italian bakery, but unfortunately their attempts lack heart. It's as if some of the cookies weren't properly taste-tested before making it to the shelves.For Pekara, I'd recommend the savory items (omelettes, sandwiches, salads, quiches) over the sweets.",

Unfortunately, the reason for the low review was the price.  I paid something like $8 for a sandwich on two of the smallest slices of sourdough bread I've ever seen and a handful of chips.  I felt ridiculously ripped off, and was left feeling hungry.  Actually, quite a few of my co-workers with more money in their pockets ended up buying seconds just to fill their appetites.  It took a little while for the food to come out as well.  The sandwich wasn't bad, just very average and ridiculously overpriced.  Soup and salad were the same.   I'll be staying away.",

It looks nice and their pastries are delicious...BUT...their crepes..are meh...I ordered the strawberry and cream crepes and I didn't like them much. Their crepes had too much cream and the cream was very strong, over powering the crepes. Strawberries weren't ripe, so a little sour in taste and the crepe was just ok. Overall, the taste wasn't pleasing and I will only be coming here if I have to, or for their bakery items.",

I went with my wife and son so we sampled a lot of things;I got both a plain croissant and a chocolate croissant (which they should have labeled \"pain au chocolat\"!).  The plain one was good but the chocolate one had the bread all wrong.My son got a cheese omelete but it was kind of hard on the outside and he didn't like it.My wife got the chicken pesto crepe, which she said was good.We also had some samples of a brownie they had out on the table.  You order at the counter and they give you a number to put on the table and then bring out the food to you when it's ready.The location is nice (and there's an outdoor part out back).  Bathroom was clean.Prices are a little high but there are some less expensive items on the menu.  Nothing really wrong with this place, I feel like there's more on the menu to try and I'll probably find a favorite.   I will probably end up checking it out again if I am in the area after I have tried a few other places on my list first.A 3-star type establishment.",

Besides amazing pastries, they have delicious sandwiches. The Cuban and Hot Chicken sandwiches are my favourites. Omelettes & crpes are meh. There's a decent selection of fresh bread too. I like the jalapeo cheese pretzels & ciabatta when they're available. The baguettes have been hard & stale on occasion. I like to go in for an espresso & a sandwich before I work night shift. I get a pastry to go or pick up one in the morning when I get off work. For ambiance, there's a rotation selection of artwork. It's often loud inside & not conducive of conversation. The baristas are sometimes attentive & sometimes they just ignore me until I flag them down. All in all, I like their pastries & some of the sandwiches, but it's not my favourite place to hang. This place is kinda hit or miss.",

My favorite soups are the tomato and red pepper bisques, and they've gone out of their way to heat some up even if it's not on the day's menu which is really going the extra mile. I've had their turkey, blt and mushroom sandwiches and all were very tasty. Their breads are really great, too and you can't beat the price for a half soup and half sandwich at lunch. The best thing are the portion sizes! When Penara or Atlanta Bread Co. give you a half sandwich it's more like a 1/4 sandwich. There are times at Pekara i can't imagine how large a full sandwich would be! I haven't tried much of their baked goods but they look amazing.",

But things didn't turn out as I had expected...I will give it two stars because the store has a nice atmosphere and good layout.  But...Baklava was dry, squished, and tasted stale.The crepes almost tasted raw and was almost rubbery to the texture.But the worst travesty was the Turkish coffee they had, which isn't really real Turkish coffee. They put a tiny cezve and the cup on a large plate; in reality they should be serving it already in the cup with the grounds already settled, without the cezve; there should be an accompanying glass of cold water (without ice), and finally it shouldnt be served with sugar cubes. The only way to truly sweeten Turkish coffee is during the brewing process when you are heating the cezve over the fire. Which means they should ask you how much sugar they want upon ordering it. Even were I to ignore this blatant trampling on the etiquette of Turkish coffee, it just tasted like incompletely made Nescafe put into a cezve and served lukewarm. Distinctly under-average establishment.",

I don't understand how they manage to make everything so plain and unappetizing. I ordered a \"ham and cheese melt\" that had ham and melted cheese on sourdough. The sourdough was vaguely stale and warm, but it was not clear that it had been toasted. The cheese had been melted on the bread, not the meat; there was a single, sad slice that didn't even cover all of the sourdough. The ham was overly salty, cut thick. Nothing else comes on the sandwich -- the bread isn't clearly buttered, pressed, or anything. No condiments. Just generally unappetizing. In retrospect I should have asked for a refund.This is the most recent sandwich disappointment. I don't think I'll make the mistake of getting anything that isn't pure sugar again.",

Hardly any foam. and then, i wanted to try something sweet so i ordered a cannoli. yeah. could not have been more disappointed. I paid almost 5 bucks for a small cannoli and it was like paper soaked in water. very heavy in texture. Could not finish it.

I went for the smoked salmon pizza, which came with cucumber and dill cream cheese... a somewhat unusual and unexpected combination, but it wasn't bad and it was pretty cheap ($8 or so?). I'm guessing this might be better place for lunch than it is for dinner. I'll probably give it another try sometime soon.",

It is one of a very few that actually MAKE their food, including breads, baked goods, crepes, soups, sandwiches, individual pizzas, and salads, in addition to coffee drinks.Pekara has now moved its baking operations to its own dedicated building (now that says something for a local successful biz, doesn't it?) to do more wholesale for local retail establishments (for example, you can find their bread at Common Grounds Food Coop, cookies at the Latte Da coffee shops in the public libraries and Carle on Windsor and baked goods at Pages for All Ages independent bookstore.I like their niche; the desserts are homey, yet professional (and they can do higher level European cakes and pastries). They have THE best spanokopita-type dish (much better than Greek versions-more like a spinach/cheese custard in filo), lovely cupcakes, great combos for soup/salad/sandwiches, and savory croissants. Oh, and did I say individual Babkas? Seating is a smart row of two chair/table setups with plenty of outlets down the hall, with a counter/bar stools in front, and larger table combos, couch/club chairs in the back. Warm weather brings a couple of tables in front, and a bricked patio in the back. The only problems I have seen are: parking (now w/the road closed, but at nights and weekends you can use the bank across the street), and sometimes poor staffing (the owners cannot be there 24/7) although this is to be expected with the high turnover of food service jobs. I have noticed that the past six months have gotten better with a couple of 'managerial'  level employees who are keeping the staff professional. This is a casual, nice place to bring someone for lunch, breakfast, a bit to eat in the evenings, to study, etc. It is not a sit down restaurant, and it can sometimes get complicated if you are eating with a group of four or more and you want to pay the bill for everyone (getting the orders in and together).  Lunchtime can get a bit crowded. Each person orders individually and the staff brings you your meals. The food arrives quickly, even the made to order crepes. They do nice box lunches, catering, and platters as well.",

The girl working there apparently confused \"lemon and cheese danish\" for pumpkin and cream cheese muffin, which she stated they did not have. So I repeated the order, and she got to work. It didn't take too long to get the crepe (less than 5 min), but when my friend ordered, I went up to the counter with her and the girl asked me \"if she could help me\" to which I replied no, I was getting water and talking to my friend. That girl had a serious problem with apathy and attitude. Later, she climbed up into the visible \"attic\" storage and THREW things down (like paper towels, boxes, etc.)The prices could be better, but it was around $12 for a crepe, a pastry, and two cups of coffee. The crepe was really tasty and the coffee was good too, but the pastry was nothing special, I've had better at Panera.",

All I wanted was some poached or scrambled eggs that didn't have dairy in them.  This was very hard to find at 7 am on a Saturday.  This place made a special order for me and they were delicious, served with some spinach and organic eggs.  The people were very nice, high quality food, fast service and reasonably priced.  If I'm in town again I would go there in a moment.",

Upon entering, I was greeted by the friendly cashier. When I asked for her recommendations she gladly offered a variety of her favorite treats and then gave me adequate time to decide what I'd like to try for myself.After much deliberation, I went with the scotch oatmeal cookie that the lovely cashier recommended along with an iced coffee. Just a heads up for anyone interested, their oatmeal cookies are the real deal, made with shortening and lots of love. So while the cookie was the perfect balance of \"crunchy AND chewy\" that the cashier promised it would be, this treat definitely serves as a more once in a while splurge in my book. There were a number of other delicious looking pastries, tiramisu, and cakes on display; it really was tough to choose!My total came to $3.25 which I thought was extremely affordable considering the use of local ingredients and the fact that, at some other coffee shops in town, you'd pay that much alone for a cookie or a coffee separately.I thoroughly enjoyed my cookie, but I also just really enjoyed the space. The noise level was prime for sitting down and getting some studying and busywork done on a lazy Friday late afternoon.The combination of friendly and accommodating staff, delicious products, and the cool bakery/coffee shop ambiance give Pekara a thumbs up in my book. I definitely hope to be back in the next week or two!",

The interior is clean and there is decent amount of space without some outdoor seating. Cashiers were nice and friendly.We enjoyed two crepes, a quiche, and a soup for breakfast. I really liked the quiche here. It's more eggy like an omelet but it was very aromatic with the bacon on the bottom. I think I ordered the Florentine quiche? The crepes are nice as well. It's not a very thin, delicate crepe, but I really liked the sweet cream inside along with the fruit. Its stuffed with the cream and what's nice is that it wasn't too sweet and it had a hint of acidity. I would skip the tomato soup with gouda here. It was too heavy in my taste - almost like a sauce. It does come with a lot of bread though.With it's price point, I'd definitely want to come back when I have the chance!",

Every one of these that I have tried has been very good.They also have really good daily soups (with surprisingly high prices) and good lunches. Their lunches are pretty expensive for what you get, but all sandwiches come on their awesome bread. They make crepes here that are pretty good, but again, the prices are pretty high for what you get. It can get crowded at lunch time, also. They have staff to deliver the meals to your tables after you order at the counter.Coffee comes in little (one size) cups and is often weak. Get your coffee next door at Aroma, people bring product from one cafe to the other all the time.It may seem like I am way too down on this place for a 4 star review, but for what I am looking for (pastries!) they are solid.",

Who else understands how big of a deal this is in urbana champaign?  The hours of 7-7pm also make it perfect for a real breakfast place.

I keep trying because I like the atmosphere more than Aroma or Kopi.  But, the wireless is always spotty. Most recently, last Friday night, the wifi wasn't working at all. We talked to a staff member, and she tried to reset it, but it never ended up working, and we ended up leaving.  The frustrating part is that we had made several purchases, were clearly there to work, and there was no indication prior to ordering that the wifi was having any problems.  I think that in these cases, if wifi is faulty, customers should be given notification before they settle in. This has happened at least twice now.I ordered a pumpkin latte, which was tasty.  The sugar cookie tasted too much like almond extract for my preferences.  I prefer purer tasting sugar cookies.I might return to Pekara in the future for bread or to have a drink when I don't need the Internet to work.",

Still, I can't help but think it was lacking something. The soda was also a bit flat. I will say that the french baguette was delicious, and I like day-old bread, so it's great for that.",

So this morning came in expecting a delicious meal; because the cookie I had the night before was homemade (plus on Monday's they give you a free chocolate  chip cookie with your purchase). So this morning my omelet was good but the butter croissant was tough. The coffee was good. The tab came to $17; a bit expensive. But I was still thinking a 4 star would be an ok rating for this caffe, that is until I asked for a coffee refill and the women attending the counter said there is a $.50 charge. I read in the menu that is posted on the wall, that  you can have a espresso shot for $.30 added to your cup of coffee. Up to this point I was still ok with their way of conducting business (although it made me appreciate coffee shops in California that refill at no charge). However I had to take the rating down to three stars because once I asked for the refill and a shot of espresso the woman attending the counter said I would have to buy a new cup of coffee. If the owner of this coffee shop reads this review, please note you should change the writing in the large menu  written in the wall and clarify the coffee refill situation. The customer service was also inconsistent the first time (night) I came in to buy my cookie the gentleman attending the counter was great. The next morning I order my $17 omelette, croissant and coffee a nice African American lady took my order. But the woman with very short light brown hair was not customer service oriented when dealing with my coffee refill issue. I came in happy to be a return customer but left not sure if I would return.",

However after that, it began to get expensive. I originally came here for a crepe, and I must say that I think their savory crepes are better than their sweet ones.The Salmon crepe that my friend ordered was good, however, the chocolate banana crepe I ordered was horrible! It was tough to cut through, there wad hardly any nutella or chocolate on it, and it tasted flavorless. I was disappointed.I ordered a fruit tart, which was good (you can't go wrong with those), but pricey. And their French sodas are okay, but also pricey.Since the main reason I came was for the crepe and the crepe I had was terrible, I can't give this rating no more than three stars.",

It has bits of white cheese (I'm still trying to figure out what kind, but it's sooo tasty!) and berries in it that set it apart from other tuna salads. Paired with a fluffy, buttery croissant, the combination of flavors is wonderful!I have also had the red pepper and smoked gouda bisque, which has been on their specials board for a couple of weeks. So good! And it comes with a generous helping of fresh bakery bread.The only thing I didn't entirely enjoy was a mango smoothie.  This is mainly because it was quite pricey for the quality IMO, since it was made with pre-squeezed mango and other juices from a container, versus using real, fresh fruit.",

I was elated to see that they had filled croissants like spinach and cheese, ham and cheese, and mushroom and cheese. I ordered the ham and cheese with a cup of cocoa - but they mistakenly gave me a mushroom and cheese croissant. I did not complain since I am an equal opportunity eater, but I know if I brought my friend here who is deathly allergic to mushrooms, well, it would have been bad.The croissant itself was beautifully flaky and tasty - not rubbery store-bought crud. I also like how Pekara prides itself in not using preservatives!However, the cocoa was awful - entirely made of Hershey's syrup that congealed at the bottom of the gigantic mug. At least the drink was beautiful.I know I'll be back, but just for the food. Additional tip: They sell half price day old bread.",

But when it's bad, it's terrible.I've had a multitude of mixed experiences here, both in service and food quality. When the baked goods are fresh, some of them can be outstanding. But when they've dried and/or gone stale and they're still selling them, it's like throwing money in the trash. (And sometimes when you ask what's fresh and you get it, it's still sub par.) The bread leaves something to be desired--I do not go here for their bread items.Pekara is not an inexpensive place to eat, either. Sometimes the service is fast and friendly and other times it's indifferent and slow. While most local businesses have a policy for a minimum spending amount to use a debit/credit card, most shop owners will still let you use your card if you're out of cash and making a purchase. Not here. I was thirty cents below the minimum and had no other means of paying for my purchase and I did not want to add on another $3 item, so the cashier took my item back and I walked out the door. It just baffles me that they'd rather lose a sale/customer than let you use your card for a $2.20 purchase.In sum: hit or miss. Could be top notch with a few changes, in this reviewer's opinion.",

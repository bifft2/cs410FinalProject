By the time I'm home, the ice cream is melted every time. Very inefficient. If I do go, I only go for the ice cream during the winter when Jarling's is closed.",

The price is a little high for fast food, but it does taste like better quality than the usual fast food suspects: McD's, Arby's, Hardee's. Drive thru service is incredibly slow as everything is supposedly cooked to order. The custard is really good and I love that kids' meals come with a free sundae, any flavor.",

The selection is mainly burgers, and fried chicken, so not much for the vegetarian and vegan crowd.  The food is very \"midwestern\" so if you are looking for a meal that is really interesting to the taste buds, this likely is not the place.I am not sure why people think the price is that awful.  They almost always have coupons in the local advertising magazines.  They also offer a student discount if you show your I Card.  My dinners of a double burger with fries and a soda often end up being $6-$7 which really isn't far from McDonalds or lesser quality establishments' prices these days.I will admit that the burgers are greasy.  The custard is also, well, custard; so it is quite fatty.  However, do you really go to a fast food place to be health conscious?Overall Culver's is a good, reasonable priced option for made to order food with fresh ingredients.",

In general, most of the more complicated items on the menu are frozen and microwaved when you order.Their breakfast offerings are not bad.  The breakfast burrito and breakfast pizza are both pretty cheap and reasonably filling.  In fairness, I have heard their grilled cheese and soup on Thursdays is good.  (I haven't had it myself.)The lunch dishes are not as good; the options change each day.  The ones that are good are .. okay, and not that pricey for near campus.  The ones that are bad are pretty bad.The nachos are alright - canned pickled jalepenos, diced up tomatoes, olives, thick tortilla chips, gloppy cheese.  There is a lot of it.  Not bad if you have a craving, but there are better options elsewhere.The salsa and hummus plate's not bad for a snack.  Of what I have had here, I would recommend it most.The hamburgers are gross.  They taste like school cafeteria low-grade meat and have the texture of frozen sausage patties.  My girlfriend's cheeseburger had a big piece of scorched .. something on top of the cheese.  Mmm.  The \"albacore tuna with mango\" sandwich is alright, but the mango is mixed in with the canned tuna, along with a lot of mayonnaise and relish.  There is not much mango to be found either.  (I've noticed charred bits on the breakfast sandwiches too, which is baffling considering I think they are just microwaved.)For sides: the low-fat cottage cheese just tasted off.  I have eaten a lot of cottage cheese and never had it taste like that - kinda chalky, kinda sour.  My girlfriend got the pasta salad, which was a little better, but swimming in vinegar with some pepperoni plopped down into it.  Our iced tea was very opaque and did not taste very fresh.  They charge for refills on soft drinks, too.Service was alright, the kitchen guy is cheerful, but the food was unpleasant enough at my last lunch that I'm not going back.  Within the same walking distance I can get to Derald's lunch truck and Espresso Royale - and I've been much happier with the food at both.  Or Red Herring, or Bevier.It is worth noting that I paid with gift certificates - none of my own money - and still felt disappointed at the cost of free.Can't comment on the baked goods, haven't had them.  What I hear is that the stuff made in house isn't great, but they get the cookies from elsewhere and they're okay.Also, after hearing - from one of the staff - that they don't change out the coffee every day in the pots, I am knocking it down to one star.  Just, don't go here except maybe for the nachos.",

If you're trying to really fill up, this is a place to get \"the bang for your buck.\" In addition, the nachos were tasty. While they weren't the greatest nachos I've ever had, I'd certainly put them above mediocre.Yesterday, I did half a sandwich and a soup. I chose turkey and swiss on challah and red pepper & gouda soup. The sandwich wasn't that much to write home about (though I was happy to see challah, even if the student working behind the counter didn't know how to pronounce it...) but that soup was fantastic. Seriously, I would eat that stuff by the gallon - so savory and creamy with little cheese chunks hanging out in there. OH MY GOD YES.In short, I'll probably be back. It's kind of a wheelhouse restaurant but I think they do a good job at it.",

Coffee and soda are cheap.  Best bet for a good meal is to get a sandwich, we made those fresh to order (dinners are just microwaved).  In the daytime there's an assortment of baked goods, at night it's just cakes & pies.  If it's going to be a busy night and you want food, make sure to go early to get a table and get your food in time, as there will be a long line.Tip - if you want something to eat during intermission, place your orders ahead of time, and it will be waiting for you at a reserved table when you get out.  Only desserts and drinks are available after the show ends.There's a parking lot underneath that used to be free, and street parking in the neighborhood is usually easy.",

Make sure you get their emails and only go on days you get the email or call there first.  Walking all the way there and finding them closed is annoying, especially on short lunch days. Check your order if you get it to go (this is good for any place you go but especially here).  Mistakes happen often. Their tomato soup is like tasteless tomato water (the grilled cheese that goes with it is almost equally tasteless).",

I think I'd rather eat junk from a vending machine next time.We had a BLT. I've never before had a BLT that used diced tomatoes and shredded lettuce. At least nothing about the sandwich was actually horrible, but when talking about a sandwich that should be as simple to do well as a BLT being mediocre and the best part of a meal....We also had the Chili, served in a bread bowl. It was thick and gummy, reminding me of Hormel's canned product. blech.For sides, we had the \"Three Bean Salad\". I don't think I've ever had a  three bean salad that featured bits of broccoli or some kind of mysterious yellow disk vegetable. Other than mysterious extra ingredients, I do not recall it being particularly horrid, but it certainly was not something I'd order again. We also had the Potato Salad,  which was decent but kinda sweet.The Iced Tea a fright, with a very industrial taste.Vying for best part of the meal with the mediocre BLT were the Oyster Crackers that came with the Chili. They were made by Nabisco, not my favorite brand, but they were fresh.",

It is in the same price-range as Golden Harbor (which I love), but in my opinion the food here is even better.We were a party of 13, and were seated comfortably in the large table in the side room. The owner of the place took our orders, and she was wonderfully fun/sassy about it. She gave great recommendations, and would tell us if she thought we were making an unsuitable selection.Cuisine highlights:- GARLIC SAUCE, anything in garlic sauce was delicious (beef, eggplant, etc)- Beijing duck (wraps had good texture, duck was cooked well, good sauces)- Crispy tofu (crispier coating than from Golden Harbor)- Fish with pine nuts (fish was battered and fried, and drizzled with a sweet sauce)- Steamed tilapia (very tender)- Scallion pancakes (owner served us two orders for free)- Kung Pao Tofu (all-around delicious)I had been skeptical of the place because of its location in the eerily-deserted Lincoln Square mall, but they renovated the place a few months back, and the ambience is great!My only regret is, having gone away, I can't partake in this sumptuousness anymore :(",

The whole plate was filled with white rice, with very little veggies and chicken (perhaps 2-3 spoons). I just had to eat dry rice, which were also overcooked. It seemed the management is trying to save costs by cutting the portion size, while charging the same price. Next time I will pay more at a different restaurant, which does not try to compromise with quality and portion size. I was so unhappy with their service that I did not pay tip. But later I saw that they added $1.00 to what I had signed on the receipt.",

The duck was good though the \"pancakes\" were cold. The spinach was acceptable (and looked like a popular dish, considering how many other tables were ordering it). But the best thing hands down was the eggplant dish, which had the best sauce I think I have ever tasted. You will like eggplant after trying this dish! There was plenty of food for all of us, and we even took some home afterward; the vegetable dishes are large portions. Price was totally reasonable. Only real complaints are that the \"hot\" tea was barely warm, and that we had to flag down our waiter to bring the check, even though we'd been sitting over empty plates for quite a while.",

Variety of Americanized Chinese food, including the all-mighty general cao's chicken, plus lunch special.3. Deserts and snack-sized dishes () are beyond comparable in CU area.4. The ONLY restaurant that opens late-night which serves authentic Chinese food rather than fast food.5. Services are above average.Cons:1. Above averagely pricy. Usually $2-$4 more expensive then similar dishes served elsewhere in CU.2. Delivery may be slow during busy hours (~40mins to ~1hour). 3. 15% tip is enforced on Chinese customers, due to their tendency to tip waiters inappropriately or not tipping at all. But if you look like a gentlemen/lady who appreciates the service of others then they won't enforce anything on you, liberty of tipping is all yours.In general, this is a great place to come if: you like real Chinese food or quality Americanized Chinese food, enjoys above average food and services, and willing to pay for the food and service. This is not a good place to come if: you would prefer to save up a little money and settle for okay food (Panda Express is always an option, right? lol), or your meal budget doesn't include tips like it is for most cheaper Chinese places.Hope this helps.",

I don't particularly love the coffee, as it's not really coffee, like Starbucks, but I like the atmosphere, staff and the Korean nostalgia I get when I am inside. The prices are steep but mainly on stuff that is not the coffee, such as the bingsoo or waffles. I would say that Cafe Bene beats out the, close, neighboring competition by a long shot; Caffe Paradiso and Espresso Royale are really no good in the coffee department.",

Perfect place to study or socialize, whichever suits your fancy.It ends there. Their coffee is always a disappointment - the regular blend is too sour. Latte based drinks too heavy on the milk. Espressos are always overdrawn.Im not sure about the safety standards either. I had the waffle with strawberries (overpriced, btw) and the strawberries smelled/tasted fishy. That happens when fruits are old/unclean/beginning to rot, as I learned from my experiences working as a produce handler. Service is not exactly unfriendly, but completely incompetent. They either have to ask your order multiple times or just flat out get it wrong-both the type and quantity of the order.I've also had a time when I've ordered a 'for here' drink (since they asked, \"for here or to go?\") and it was served me in a paper cup. I then went up two more times to get that same drink, and both times they asked \"in a for here or to go cup?\" so I said 'for here' and all three times it was given me in a paper cup. Insulting.",

Misugaru latte tasted like drinking dissolved chalk in water.  Classic Arnold palmer was a very badly conceived balance of tea to lemonade.  Honey bread was 99% standard dry bread.  Though it tasted okay, the dryness from the rest of the bread overtook any toppings added to it.Value.  1/10.  Honey bread is probably something close to a 2000% markup on ingredients.  Cannot go here regularly without breaking the bank.  If the taste and quality and consistency of the drinks was commensurate with the price, then that'd be different since the upcharge would be tied to a higher level of enjoyment from a higher quality product.  But it seems like they are peddling cheap and badly made drinks and food, for outrageous prices.Going once a year is probably a good bet for this place.  Going too often will make you poor, and will leave a bad taste in your mouth (if the food and drink hasn't already), because you feel as though you've paid for a meal and a drink, but have been given a hodgepodge of 10 cent ingredients prettied up to look good.  Great ambience, and customer service only get you so far when the food and drink you serve is inconsistent, outrageously priced, and lackluster at best.",

I just want to say that your message just make me want to throw up, your a retard I hope you will never come back to caffe bene again.\"Did I just receive internet hate? Also, people feel this strongly about this place? The drinks I ordered wanted to make me throw up, which may explain why my review was vomit-inducing. It doesn't take much training to mix in the powder into the liquid. The drinks we got when I was there was half powder floating on top of the ice and milk. I will admit that I haven't been back since I was there last time but since then I haven't heard anything good about the place. Giving it another one star rating in place of a friend who went and was terribly disappointed. Don't expect decent coffee here. Paradiso is just a block away, go there instead.",

They're opening a new location on Green Street, so I hope they handle the first weeks better.The interior is really trendy and usually quiet, so it's a nice place to grab a cup of coffee and study. Their green tea frappe is alright. I think it's a bit too icy and Starbucks makes it better. However, the honey bread is fantastic! I got the strawberry honey bread to go and it's absolutely gorgeous how they package their food. The bread is really sweet and thick, drizzled in honey, and on top is an arrangement of strawberries in the form of a flower. I was wondering why it took so long for it to come out, but it's definitely worth the wait! Their gelato is also fantastic and they give you a lot for $2. I recommend getting the green tea or Greek yogurt flavors.They also have meal options and tons of the cutest desserts, so I definitely plan to return and try them!",

When I ordered a drink called misugaru, the trainee was trying to figure out how to order. The supervisor came over rudely and asked me \"what are you trying to order\" in a really off putting way. The trainee was EXTREMELY polite by the way! When the drink came out it was not what I was expecting, and really gross. We spent $18 at the place, so I went to the counter immediately and explained it wasn't what I was expecting and if possible I'd like to change my order. The trainee apologized and went to ask her supervisor. The supervisor, right in front of me, wouldn't turn around. She told the trainee \"ummm no I don't think we do that\". The trainee apologized. Bad experience. I didn't expect a free drink, even though we spent a lot of money. I at least wanted the supervisor to look at me and explain instead of Laying it on the very nice trainee.I ended up drinking most of the misugaru. I like healthy carb options, and it's not all the bad. The initial taste was weird but it's okay. It's a multi-grain mill drink. The only thing is that when I spend a lot of money at a place, and unfortunately order something I don't enjoy, I hope the supervisor comes out to ask what's wrong...",

There was a Thai iced tea flavor/color to it, I'll give them that, dunno how well it mixes with tapioca pearls, and for the price I'll go across the street to Basil Thai. Everything in here was hilariously expensive. I got a blueberry muffin that could have been purchased at Sam's Club by the pallet for the same level of quality. The place is clean, the uniforms are cute, and I'm sure the homesick ex-pats will keep it in business, but for those prices vs. quality I'll be going elsewhere.",

First a waiter eating a bag of potato chips on duty at the bar talking to 2 girls.  Then the guys cooking the burgers starts talking to them. He puts on one of the girls sunglasses and continues to cook. Then he gives them back and plays with he key chains. Then cooks again. Never washing his hands and never wearing gloves. Then I see our waiter come out of the back eating food as he is getting our drinks, meanwhile no manager in site. Finally after about 20 mins the manager Lewis comes out of the back for just a bit to talk to a couple waitresses and drinking margaritas the night before. This place is a total joke!!!!",

It has been burnt both times I have visited in the early mornings, despite my hope that the first time was an isolated incident. They sell the 'Seattle's Best' brand, which I would imagine is not inherently bad coffee, but something in their process is off, as it is not good coffee in my book: too burned and too bitter for how disappointingly not strong it is. Also, the coffee only comes in small cups. I wanted a 20 oz. jar of rocket fuel, but settled for 12 oz. of undrinkable ash.Service was friendly and fairly fast. I could not bear to give this less than 2 stars based upon only reviewing one menu item, but if this was a coffeehouse serving this hot garbage, it would be a one star.",

I also cannot leave a review for the food due to us picking up & leaving before we could get a food order in due to the lack of organization in this place.  The table of 6 sitting next to us mentioned they had been waiting for close to an hour, and 5 of the six were just about done with their food and one person was still waiting.  We said forget it, and went next door to Cracker Barrel and got seated & our food very quickly.  It appears that the other reviews for this location are similar to what we experienced.  Poor management, poor attitudes, and I can only imagine what goes on with the food preparation.  Save your hard earned money and avoid this Steak 'n Shake at all cost.",

My orange juice and soup were exceptional!The ambiance that afternoon was very calm and perfect for the two of us. I love the decor and the wait staff is very kind!

The food here is alright but it has so much more potential to be great, and more flavorful, especially for such a price. I think they need to become more creative and up their standards here until they can be compared to the trendy vegetarian restaurants in Chicago.",

And the atmosphere was warm, colourful, & inviting. The tofu scramble burrito ($8.50) is so good! Tofu scramble with black beans, roasted red peppers, cheddar cheeze. There are hints of curry, black beans, & potatoes in every tasty bite. The burrito is rather large & they don't skimp on the scramble. Yet, I was able to consume all of it because I have an enormous appetite that I justify with biking everywhere. It's served with fries, salsa & guacamole. The burrito comes with the choice of a side & I chose fries because I have a fetish for quality fries. These fries did not disappoint. They were potatoey, crisp on the outside, & lightly salted. I had all this with a Tingler ($4.95, 8oz) - a concoction of spinach, kale, beets, carrots, cucumber, parsley, ginger, lemon, line, orange & apple juices. Everything was delicious but the whole time, I was making eyes at the lavender cake so of course I had to have a slice ($4.95). After the first bite, I was contemplating getting a whole cake for myself. I departed full & happy. It was a fantastic brunch/lunch/whatever at Dancing Dog",

When I saw the menu,  I was disappointed to see that most of it consists of things from the vegan frozen section at the grocery store - things that are just as convenient for me to make at home for a fraction of the price since the prices are a little inflated here in my opinion. We got the soup and the tempeh salad sandwich and ordered a beer and a smoothie while we waited. For some reason, our waitress felt it necessary to apologize 3 or 4 times for the wait on food. We gave no indication that we were in a rush.  It made us uncomfortable. She eventually started blaming inexperienced kitchen staff which was unnecessary. When she brought out the smoothie, it was about 2 inches shy of filling the glass which was odd. They need to either make bigger smoothies or buy smaller glasses to serve them in. I couldn't help but feel like I had been shorted. When the food came out, we both felt like it was under seasoned. There wasn't salt and pepper at the tables for me to fix my soup. When I considered asking for some, I decided against it. I didn't want our waitress to have more things to apologize for.In the end, we were underwhelmed. The smoothie was good but not worth the price. Save yourself some money and make yourself a veggie hot dog or fibbish fry at home.  If they add some more homemade items to the menu, I might try it again but I don't think we'll be back.Also, I'm not sure if it's a great idea to attempt to make gluten free desserts in the same facility where you make seitan from scratch. I know from experience that pure wheat gluten has a tendency to make its way everywhere.",

I asked the waitress if they could add some more spice to it. She said okay but then didn't return for another 15 minutes. By then I had given up and just added salt to the bowl and ate it.  I also got one of their smoothies and was similarly unimpressed. I'm not sure why they are so expensive; I don't think they even use organic ingredients. Really surprised by what a high rating this restaurant is getting.  To me the food and smoothies severely lacked flavor.",

                "review": "After spending over a year researching vegan eats all over the east coast, I knew the thing I would miss most about NYC and Philly is the array of vegan dining options that central IL is severely lacking. Luckily, this Dog came dancing into my life and did more than soften the blow...Specific favorite things about DD:1.) Dessert: Ever heard of Vegan Treats in Bethlehem, PA? It was named one of the top 10 bakeries in the world. I can honestly say that after trying ~ 20 treats from there, I have had DD desserts that I've enjoyed more than many at VT. DD has new desserts every day, so it's my favorite part each visit to walk in and see what's on display. Some days have a better selection than others, so I wish the pastry department would expand to guarantee at least 2-3 cakes/cupcakes each day (always so moist and decadent). Some gems I've tried are GF vanilla lavender cake, \"ricotta\" cheesecake trifle, peanut butter fudge, and an oatmeal cream pie that would make Little Debbie abandon her reign and go veg for life.2.) Lunch/Dinner options: I'm happy to see the menu is expanded, although I certainly don't have a problem with the kitchen continuing to experiment with even more options for me to try. (; Here are some highlights:-- Soups. They have an actual soup wizard working for them. One Soup of the Day I was particularly impressed with a couple months ago, humbly titled \"mushroom\", was full of beautiful shiitakes, shining in a rich and silky umami broth of love. The chili is offered daily and it is also very tasty, hearty yet light and full of vegetables in addition to the beans.-- Down & Dirty Dog.  This dog isn't made of random appendages from who knows how many species of animal. Nor is it the beige rubber stick that vegans have been begrudgingly choking down at bonfires for years. It's the best dog I've ever had. And the slaw and baked beans are even better, offering a hint of sweetness and a creamy crunch. There's also a pickle involved if you want even more crunch and tang, but I kind of liked eating the pickle separately because the slaw and beans are too good to be \"speared\" like that (ha).-- Seitan Rueben. I've had other versions of this, including the famous Chicago Diner one, but DD's is special in its own right. I love that the seitan is made in-house because I know many vegan restaurants (even Vedge, the best vegan restaurant in the country) use seitan from outside sources. Plus DD's thousand island relish is crazy good. -- Quinoa Scoop On A Bed. I once heard another customer tell a server the salad should be renamed to \"Mound of Goodness\". I wouldn't disagree. Mostly because of that tangy avocado dressing, but also because I when I want a salad, I want a legit sized bowl full of dark green and purple leaves, not a handful of lettuce with a tasteless tomato on top. 3.) The Veggs Bennedog for Sunday brunch. The Hollandaise sauce is insane. Who needs egg yolks ever? Even better with spinach!4.) Staff: Everyone I've met here has been awesome; not just knowledgeable about the food but actually excited about it too (an unfortunate rarity in the food industry). I've even had a some interactions with the owners Linda and Brian (who are usually around - another sign of a great restaurant), and I can tell they are wonderful people who care about the food being served, and treat their employees well.Overall, the Dancing Dog executes well what it has set out to be: a place where vegans and non-vegans can happily mingle with plenty of satisfying and tasty options, mostly reminiscent of traditional cafe/diner fare. They're still new and have a ton of potential to grow, which is exciting because they are off to an excellent start. This being said, the main suggestion I'd like to see more of in the future is fresh produce shining in more dishes.. Especially seasonal; it is winter so I'd love something like sweet potato gnocchi and roasted kabocha squash in sage brown butter sauce. (Also I hope real lemons are used in lemon cakes, not lemon extract, for example.) (Final note, in response to a previous comment about using items from the vegan section of a grocery store... First, only a few menu items here even contain faux meats, certainly not the majority of the menu. And much like how non-veg restaurants do not construct chicken cutlets out of pantry ingredients and witchcraft, I'm guessing DD chooses certain faux meats because they cannot produce them in the kitchen. No, vegan restaurants do not NEED to use processed faux animal products, but the truth is that many vegans and non-vegans alike are intrigued by dishes that resemble childhood favorites, for instance, that we no longer eat because of the poor practices of the meat and dairy industries. Regardless, while 3-4 dishes on the menu use such \"meats\" as a component, the kitchen does their own seasoning/treatment to them, and all the accoutrements they are served with are house-made and delicious!)",

I really wanted to try the Fibbish and Chips, but they had run out. So, I ended up going with The Down and Dirty Dog with the quinoa and corn salad as my side. I also had a Pineapple Blueberry smoothie. Just drinking that smoothie made me feel healthier (technically one smoothie won't make you healthier, but that's besides the point). I get my smoothie first and they had made it wrong, it tasted a little off and looked kind of not right in color, but I actually wasn't going to say anything. They knew though and had another made for me that looked much better when I got it.  Then, my food came. The quinoa and corn salad is very light. I like it, although I think if they use lemon at all in it, maybe a little more. The Down and Dirty Dog is delicious! The beans and slaw on it are the pice de rsistance. I love the slaw! :) I decided that I might as well finish with a dessert since I was going to do a review. I was going to get a piece of their double chocolate cake, but someone literally ordered the rest of it before I was able to acquire a piece. Oh well, another time. I did however, get one of their big chocolate chip cookies. It has walnuts in it and I don't normally like walnuts in my chocolate chip cookies, but the walnuts added to the flavor and texture of the cookie. It was a little crispy on the edges and nice and soft otherwise. It was a really good food experience and I will be back.",

We started with the hummus plate and the hummus tasted fresh and so were the veggies. I got the dirty dog, which is a must-try. It is a veggie dog with baked beans, coleslaw and a pickle on top. Yum!!!My boyfriend got the tofu scramble burrito and it was delicious as well!We weren't expecting to find such an amazing vegan cafe in Urbana, everyone needs to try this place out!",

The staff are very friendly, and everything on the menu (including the wine) is 100% vegan. I had the vegan fish and chips. I think the vegan fish pieces (there were three) are Sophie's Choice brand, and they are deep fried, so if you are looking for vegan health food, this might not be the dish for you. However, if you want the closest thing I've ever tasted to British-style fish and chips, this would be it. The tartar sauce was tasty and the coleslaw was some of the best I've had anywhere. For dessert, I ordered the chocolate chocolate chip, cookie, which was also excellent. Dense and chocolatey, slightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.I will definitely visit here again the next time I'm in Urbana. Any vegans and vegetarians in town should feel lucky to have this wonderful restaurant.",

The juice, lasagna, and salad were all excellent.  Portions seemed generous and fresh.  We also ordered the German chocolate cake and the frosting was delicious, but the cake itself was a little dry and had a sawdust texture.  Otherwise, it was decent.Overall, however, this proved to be a better experience than my first time dining here, when it was becoming very chilly this past winter and I ordered a tempeh wrap thinking it would be a hot sandwich--only to have it arrive cold.  Not appetizing.  I hope they continue to experiment some more, and consider offering more rice or quinoa dishes that deviate from the expected (spaghetti, for example).",

I got this wonderful Peanut Butter thai veggie bowl with rice that had the most amazing flavor and totally hit the spot for a perfect dinner option! The place was cool, you can order anything off the menu vegan, and they have amazing looking deserts! I went back the next morning to get coffee for the road and I loved how they had Soy Creamer (not just soy milk) for the coffee! Really wonderful spot!

One major major problem with this taco was that the flavor of the pork belly is completely lost. It almost tastes like you're eating just the veggies and the sauce. The sauce is only good if there is a fatty meat flavor that goes with it.They probably didn't season the pork belly at all. And that's such a shame. I'd probably season it and cook it in sesame oil to bring out the flavor. For 4 dollars this taco was not worth it. I'd give it a 2.5/5 but I'll round up.",

                "review": "Roks Korean BBQ Taco Truck is trying to do in Champaign what is successfully being done in places like LA with Kogi Truck, and Korilla BBQ in NYC.  Review based on the metrics of taste, service, and value. The two most successful Korean BBQ trucks, Kogi Truck in California, and Korilla BBQ in New York are where I base my comparison for these three metrics.  I can say safely that Roks Korean BBQ Taco Truck sits comfortably ranked second among the three.Korilla BBQ, where they charge more, can back up the prices they charge with quick and professional service, and Korean BBQ Tacos that are ridiculously delicious.  Well balanced, deep and heavy flavor in the proteins, paired with bright notes in the slaw and sides that come with it.  Though I would spend more money at Korilla compared to Kogi Truck in LA or Roks, I would never feel like it was wasted money by any means.  Korilla still stands as the defacto standard of delicious Korean BBQ Tacos.Now enter in Roks, trying to build on the success of Korean BBQ Taco trucks, and you find that they build on many of the same principles that Korilla has done so well.  Looking at the metric of taste, Rok's does a great job.  The protein is well seasoned, and supported well with bright balanced notes through radish and lettuce.  The gohchoojjang based sauce they put on top of the lettuce is sweet more than spicy, and ties everything together nicely.  Tacos are a little unwieldy to eat though, and since the sauce is on top of the lettuce, you may find yourself spilling sauce covered lettuce all over yourself while you eat.  They may want to consider putting the sauce over the protect, and then packing in clean lettuce on top.  From a taste perspective however, Rok's is on point as they pay respect to the Korean BBQ taste both of the pork and bulgogi, while keeping it fresh and delicious for the American palette.  Definitely a 4/5 on taste.Now Service.  As well as can be expected for a food truck.  A friendly face at the window, a clear ticket written for my order, money taken, and their off and running to make my food fresh.  The wait was about 4 minutes for the 4 tacos I ordered, which isn't terrible, and they were kind enough to wrap my tacos in a paper bag for me as I was taking my order to go, and wasn't going to eat it right there truck side.  Inside the truck looked nice and clean, which is important to me, and catching a glimpse of a hand sanitizer dispenser is always a welcome sight for a food service truck, just so long as they aren't getting triclosan in my food. =) Definitely a 5/5 on service.Value.  Admittedly, for all of my reviews, it's near impossible to get a 5/5 on value.  But this is probably the most important metric for people these days.  Especially in the food truck industry which is more about function and value, more than it is about a unbridled desire to get high quality delicious food.  At Roks, each taco ran $4.  Coming from my experience with Korilla and Kogi Truck, my immediate reaction was to scoff at the price.  I had a $20 bill in my hand and was expecting to get about $10 back after buying my lunch, and tipping them.  But with a $20, I bought 4 tacos, and tipped them the rest.  It was difficult getting around that price point knowing that Kogi Truck in LA charges something like $2.50 per taco, and have combo deals, 3 tacos and a drink for $8, etc.  But when I got my tacos, and looking at the serving size, it was semi-justifiable, but not really.  Where Roks taco's are bigger than Kogi Truck's, they are the same size as Korilla's, but again, here in Champaign, it was difficult to justify $4 a taco to myself. If I wasn't buying so many tacos so that I could try them and write a review, I would be hard pressed to justify spending $12 or $16 on 3 or 4 tacos.  Considering that Roks is in Champaign, IL, $4 a taco is close to an outrageous price per taco, especially when the serving size would necessitate 3 or 4 tacos as a lunch portion.  So for value, Roks gets a 2/5 rating.  I'm sure on paper, someone can justify $4, to account for operating costs, overhead, and margins, but as a customer who just cares about how much food, and for how much, the taste, while very delicious, still does not justify the $4 cost per taco.It's a difficult because as much as I've been waiting for a Korean BBQ Taco truck in Champaign for a long time, Roks, where their tacos are delicious, I can't see myself going there more than once a month.  The wife however is a big fan and vows to return. She's the reason why the overall rating is 4/5 and not 3/5.A food truck has to work towards gaining daily, or several visits weekly support if it is to be sustainable with decent margins.  But at the $4 price point per taco, it has shifted out of affordable with justifiable value range, to \"once in a while.\"  Good service and tacos, but it has to taste good to my palette AND my wallet for repeat business.  Change it to $3/taco, and I'd be there more often.",

Bulgogi taco was great, sweet and spicy as advertised.  Pork katsu was good but found it a little bland?  Maybe that's because I had it following the rice balls which were outstanding.  They were nicely crisped with a nice spicy aoli on top.  Although it would have been better to have the sauce on the side for dipping.  I'll have to ask next time.Service is steady as there was a several person line the 15 minutes I was there.  I probably waited 5 minutes after placing my order.  Definitely a good place to grab something different for lunch.",

I understand that it's a taco sampler, so each one of them was going to be smaller than regular size tacos, but this is ridiculous. There was almost no meat on any of them. Four tiny tortillas (actually more like three) with almost nothing on them, costing $10. I had such high hopes for roks. I honestly hope they see this review-not so they can know that I'm angry at them, but rather that they will change.For now, if you're craving Korean tacos, just go to spoon house. Their tacos are actually really good.",

I believe what I had was called an Ace-Deuce, it had a spicy sauce, lettuce and a few other things on it and the main meat was like seasoned pork. Overall it tasted really good. Definitely a unique flavor that even drunk me was able to remember and now rave about. Perhaps I'm just not experienced with Korean flavors but this was definitely quite good. Lots of good texture, the meat tasted to be of decent quality, fresh veggies, etc.My only qualms, like many others here, is the price. These tacos are expensive, and they are especially small. Like really small, too small to charge $4/taco. My friend was quite let down with the size of the sampler, which, at $10 plus the upcharge he paid for kimchee, was also underwhelming and we both found ourselves hungry after getting home. The problem here is that hungry students know what they can get for X amount of $. If I'm not mistaken, almost all the Mexican places on campus (Maize, Chipotle, El Charro, Burrito King) have a massive burrito that is even less $ than 2 of ROKs tacos. Granted, the better of those places aren't as unique and also not as conveniently open late, but anyone who has been to ROKs and is looking for a full meal knows it probably can't be had there for under $10. Not to mention the often difficult task of having to locate a food truck when it's not in it's usual spot, and potentially having to travel farther. Unfortunately uniqueness and flavor are often overlooked in favor of portion size.If the portion size was improved, I'd be a regular for sure. ROKs has a lot of potential.",

I love that you can order Mexico style with cilantro and onion or American style with lettuce and tomatoes.  The quesadillas are overstuffed and toasted perfectly.  One quesadilla could definitely feed two, especially if you throw 1 or 2 tacos in the mix.  I've also tried the steak taco, American style and the chicken quesadilla.  The food is so fresh tasting and the meat tastes like real, high quality product. Another huge perk... The workers!  They are so friendly.  During our first visit, we were given some homemade pickled jalapenos to try.  They were amazing.  They aren't on the menu, so I'm not sure what to ask for next time I want them!  You have to try this place!  It's cash only and they will wrap your food to go if you prefer to not eat at the picnic table.",

There is an easy menu of flavorful basics: tacos, flour or corn, American and Mexican, tortas, burritos, and guacamole. Everything runs from $2 (tacos) to $8 for a massive burrito. But the star of this place is the elote.  Being from Chicago, elotes are a part of summertime. It's easy to make: cheese, corn on the cob, and chil but the flavors have to be just right to be authentic. And luckily for us poor central Illinoisians, Motorizado figured it out. For $2.50 you can enjoy this wonderful treat. They do go fast but if you come by at lunch, they usually have it. The service is quick. Just grab two sauces and a Jarritto from the shop next door and you're living the life. Heads up that there is no place to sit except one picnic table that might snap if you sit too long. It's definitely a part of the charm,  lol.",

I cannot speak of the burritos or the quesadillas because I've never had them. I stick to my tacos. I've tried all their tacos. My favorite are the steak and chicken tacos with a side of guacamole & chips.For Maize fans:This spot has better sauces, and is more affordable. If you want the maize taste just ask them to add cheese. You end up eating just as good if not better for a reasonable price.",

It was loaded with steak, veggies, and cheese. It was messy and fantastic. Easily the best torta I've had. The steak was in small bits and was great; some Mexican restaurants have chewy steak in their food, this was the opposite.I'm nervous putting this review up in fear the lines will stretch from the parking lot to the intersection of Prospect and Bradley, but I really want this place to stay open.See CT's review here ... http://champaign-taste.blogspot.com/",

While I don't think that $18 a person is too much for a nice brunch every once in awhile, i do expect to get what I pay for.I don't want to be ignored by the hostess, then treated rudely by both her and the waitress.  Additionally, I expect the food to be restocked.  If you own a restaurant and advertise that brunch is offered until 2:30, the brunch should be stocked until that time.  If you want to stop stocking the brunch at 1:00, the advertise that the brunch ends at 1:00.  The good foods were omelets and waffles, smoked salmon and shrimp; the two things I could get cooked fresh, and the two things that are served best cold.  Everything else was cold, crusty crap.We were rushed by the waitress who couldn't be bothered to refill our drinks.  Busboys were texting, no one would check us out when it was time to pay.  In fact, the only nice people there were the bartender and the omelet chef.  I liked this place in the past, and if I have another chance to come back, I will...so I guess the have a chance to gain some stars.",

It's never my choice-- Champaign has a handful of restaurants where everyone goes when they're looking for a somewhat upscale experience and Silvercreek falls into this category. And so I find myself here for graduation celebrations, birthdays, meals for when relatives are visiting, and so on. Most of my experiences here have been for their Sunday buffet brunch. They offer your standard biscuits, gravy, bacon, potatoes, as well as some lunch-ier fare like pasta and prime rib. It is all less than mediocre. Last time I was there for brunch, my dad said, \"We should have gone to Ryan's.\" Ouch. They have a pretty big selection of desserts. It really grinds my gears that even though they have an omelet and waffle station, they can't make eggs to order because they only have a big bowl of premade egg mix on hand. So yeah, no fresh eggs on hand. They have scrambled eggs in the buffet line but... gross. Side note, try not to get seated by the omelet station. It gets boiling hot. Last time I was here, I actually dunked my cloth napkin in my water and dabbed my face and neck with it. I mentioned the heat to the hostess on the way out-- she asked how the meal was-- and her response was \"Oh, in the greenhouse? Yeah, hot day.\" No, not in the greenhouse. But that reminds me...My best friend had her bridal shower at Silvercreek about a year ago, in the greenhouse. In the middle of the meal, one of the chandeliers DROPPED FROM THE CEILING and shattered on the middle of a table. Unreal. The staff did not know how to handle the situation and the only compensation was free dessert. This place is such a mess.",

Since I try to eat vegan and I know it can be a pain to sort that out in a large party, I called ahead to ask if there were any vegan items on the menu.  The hostess was incredibly helpful, pointing me toward a couple of salads and a vegetarian entree that could easily be made vegan, and reassuring me that if nothing on the menu caught my eye, the chef would be more than happy to create something for me with the veggies and pasta they have available.Service at the restaurant was equally good.  I went with the autumn salad (Garden greens, apricots, pears, grapes, pecans, hazelnut vinaigrette) which was refreshing and delicious, and the stuffed poblano peppers (Black bean, corn & rice stuffing, red onion, cilantro, chihuahua cheese, paquillo pepper sauce) without the cheese.  The peppers were TO DIE for.  The pepper sauce was insane, creamy and delicious, yet somehow dairy free.  I still wish I had gotten that recipe!I'd definitely recommend Silvercreek for any vegans or non-vegans looking to get a high-quality meal!",

I ordered the jumbo shrimp appetizer (the name escapes me), which was incredibly spicy.  It was ok.  I also ordered the spinach salad, which was quite good.  My fiancee ordered the pot roast entree, which I sampled, and it was actually very good.  My friend ordered the brie appetizer, which was also quite tasty.  The only downside was the service, which was slightly lacking.  The price is moderate but nothing completely unreasonable.  They also have a nice selection of domestic and import beverages, which always makes me warm and fuzzy inside.",

The \"homemade\" biscuits were hard.Of all the places we ate in Champaign, this was the worst.  Definitely not worth $20+ for the same kind of Sterno-warmed slop you'd find at Old Country Buffet.Go get a cup of Jarling's Custard and make that your brunch.",

I have never been disappointed.  Recently, I went to dinner there during Grad week.  It was very busy (as to be expected) and I had a large party of 9 people, we had a reservation but still had  to wait for our table, during our wait a girl came around with a cookie basket and the manager made several stops to ask us if we needed anything.  Once we got seated, our waitress, \"Diana\" (?) greeted us immediately and was very knowledgeable about the menu, she was very nice and personable.  A few of us sampled the specialty drinks on the menu which were delicious.  I had the Lobster Bisque soup - holy crap, unbelievable!  I mean, I could have licked the bowl.  Another gentleman in my party pretty much did!  For my entree I had the filet, the quality of meat and preparation was so nice.  The way the Chef placed the meat on top of the potatoes and asparagus was very upscale, not to mention easily the best steak I have ever had.  The potatoes & asparagus perfectly complimented the flavor of the filet.  For dessert I had the flour-less chocolate cake.  No cake should ever have flour, as this was the best dessert I have ever had...  In my life.  I would HIGHLY recommend this restaurant, the price is reasonable and for a casual upscale dining you can't get any better!  Go there now!",

The dish definitely was a bit better than your standard macaroni fare, but I don't think it's good enough to warrant an $18 price tag. The Sunday buffet is similar. It costs $20 and the food is a bit better than your standard buffet food, but not enough to warrant the much higher price.",

It was August and it felt like the A/C was broken in there, I had to use a menu as a fan. Service was slow and rude (we waited about 10 minutes just to get a beer menu, which we had to make a special request for). Music was terrible and so loud I couldn't tune it out (bad slow jams and classic 70s tunes). My so-called  \"Roasted red pepper risotto\" had not red pepper, but contained raw green pepper. And a fly died in my husband's beer. Yeah, like I said: Never again. There are much better places to eat within just a few blocks, for way cheaper.",

I dined with my husband, and we had a late reservation. We had tickets to a performance at the Krannert, and wanted to eat dinner afterward. Silvercreek was one of the few places which had their kitchen open past 10, so we decided to check it out. We made a reservation, because we wanted them to know that we were coming. There were still two other tables dining when we got there, but that was it. I should have realized that something was wrong when I saw the totally empty parking lot at 10pm on a Saturday night.First problem: the place was really bright and the music was awful. Chain-restaurant bad 70s music and lighting. Not what I was expecting for the description of what they were going for or for their prices. Pros: the restored location is really charming, and with better lighting and a less cheap and intrusive soundtrack, the place could be beautiful.Second problem: the booth was dirty. The whole place was practically empty, they knew we were coming and they didn't bother to make sure that the table was clean?The menu is a nice one. We opted for the calamari to start, then my husband ordered the lamb and I ordered the duck. We like both medium rare, which is the standard way that both meats should be served.The food was just such a miss. The calamari was okay, and it would have been fine at Applebee's. For the price, a pile of frozen calamari rings (interspersed with pieces of fries and onion fritters - clean your fryer guys!) served with canned sauces is not the \"best of local, seasonal Illinois\". The entrees came out fast. I mean really fast. So fast that they were decidedly undercooked. I had already gotten a sense that even though the place was theoretically open for another hour, they were unhappy that we were there. Even though they knew we were coming. And they were open for another hour. Both the lamb and the duck were under rare. The cherry jam that was served accompanying my duck was refrigerator cold.We probably should have sent the food back, but it was obvious that the kitchen was hostile to the idea that people were bothering them an hour before they were even supposed to be closed, so I was somewhat afraid of what would happen if we did. Flat out: the kitchen shouldn't have sent out grossly undercooked food and the server shouldn't have brought the meat to our table that way. The message \"here's your food, eat and get the hell out so we can go home\" was not exactly subtle.The food would have been good if it had been cooked properly. The plate presentations were nice and the cherry jam was pretty good - nice warm spices and cherries cooked just soft enough. The jam would have been a great accompaniment to the duck, if it wasn't obviously straight out of the walk-in.It got worse, though. We had ordered a bottle of wine to share, and the entrees came out so fast that we were only half-way through. I'd noticed an \"artisinal cheese plate\" on the appetizer list. I figured that that would be something we could snack on while we finished our wine. Especially since the raw meat wasn't exactly a palatable meal. It also wasn't something that would take a whole lot of work from the kitchen, so I figured it would be safe. When she walked away from the table, the server yelled back to the kitchen \"Cheese plate coming\" Mel's diner-style. Seriously. The kitchen yelled something back to her about not knowing how to make one.The cheese plate was $19.00 for the large. What we got was a platter of cheese straight from the deli case at the local supermarket. Boursin, some sort of italian herb cheese, a really cheap Double Glouster, a brie and some bland white cheese. Not one of them were anything that would be close to artisan. Not one of them is \"the best of local, seasonal Illinois\". It was served with a handful of jarred black olives and a heaping scoop of the aforementioned ice-cold cherry jam. It wasn't an awful cheese plate, but it is not what it's advertised as, which is surprising since there are a fair number of artisan cheese producers in the area. For $19, I was expecting more than cold supermarket cheese.Soon after the cheese came the bill. No offer of desert, which is fine, since by that time we really wanted to get out of there and I could have stopped by the store on the way home and gotten some frozen pie if more stuff out of a box was where I wanted to go with the night.If you're looking for a nice meal, especially late, go elsewhere. The price they charge here does not match the atmosphere, service, quality or taste. It's more family dining, and it would have been great if the bill hadn't run to almost $200 (that's with wine, tax and tip). For slightly more money there are better places in town that don't make you feel like they hate you for coming in while they are open.",

The food was honestly the best i've ever had at a wedding reception and there was more than enough even with the guests piling enough food on their plates for a small nation! After dinner, the staff inconspicuously removed two tables to create a dance floor that stayed full the rest of the evening. The couple had a very tight budget for their wedding so I suspect the cost of the reception was well below what one would expect. It was truly lovely.",

I was surprised when I walked through the door, the decor were nice and the hostess was pleasant. Our waitress was nice, she kept our drinks full and came by often to check on us. The food was good, I really liked the prime rib and the mixed green salad was good as well. For those sweets lover, the cake area is the best. It's like being in dessert heaven! Overall, I really enjoy the service and the food. I would definitely recommend this to others.",

I walk out of here feeling stuffed for days!  While the cost is not cheap- I think it's around $19 including a beverage, it is well, well worth it! I have tried the other top Sunday brunch place in Urbana, and Silvercreek blows them away!  :)",

I mean really, do you need another reason. And they have them!!! This is a buffet style brunch and they keep it classy. Everything is good! The waffle bar is fun and full of amazing toppings. They have your normal breakfast food and they have a salad bar with smoked salmon and cream cheese. I love love love that they have turkey sausage links on the hot food bar. I don't eat pork, so this makes me very happy. There service is great too. We call ahead for seats and they are always happy to help. The manager came by our table and is always friendly. I love it here. We will be back of course! The 4 start is because they are a little pricey. It's $20.00 a person, with no drinks. Ouch. But in a way, they do give you a lot. Try to flourless chocolate cake. I promise you its amazing.",

That being said, I have had some hit or miss experiences with both the food and the service while I have been there. Most recently, I had dinner with my family there to celebrate my graduation for the University of Illinois. We had put in a reservation for our party well in advance and paid a substantial deposit. We showed up slightly early for the reservation and still had to wait almost an hour after the designated time. We were repeatedly told that it wouldn't be much longer, but by the time our party got to the table we were starving and pretty tired of being there. While I recognized that graduation is a very hectic time for people, I just did not understand what the point of making a reservation was when we had to wait as long as people who walked in the door. Once we were seated, the service was a little slow but was much more reasonable. Everyone enjoyed the food, which was flavorful and filling. Our favorite item was some sort of crab hushpuppies that were simply phenomenal. However, on other occasions, I have ordered fish dishes and found them to be somewhat bland. Overall, this place is a nice place to eat if you're looking for somewhere with a fancy vibe in Urbana. However, I would steer clear of it for important events (parents weekends, graduation, homecoming and other peak times) and check the menu before you go to ensure that the food suits your tastes.",

First, it took 5 minutes to be seated because no one was up at the front. Then we got a little sass from the server who sat us because I asked if we could go to a booth instead of the floater table she took us to. The worst part, though, was that it took about 10-15 minutes to order, and then about 20 minutes for our burgers to come. Another couple that had arrived 25 minutes after us got their burgers right after us, so it seemed to be an issue with just our order. Either way, the food wasn't anything spectacular in the end and this visit today left a bad impression on me :/",

But the burger I had at this place was one of the most fancy-schmancy burgers ever served to me. But let's start with the service. Every time our waitress spoke, I couldn't help but wonder if she was frustrated from constipation. Her aggressive questioning made me feel uncomfortable, but at the same time she got the job done, so I'm not going to judge. Since we were in a hurry, we decided to skip the appetizers, but the the dinner was fantastic. The burger was cooked to order, and the fries were one of the tastiest things I have ever experienced, and I could easily eat them for the rest of my long life.",

Definitely a stressful and extremely unpleasant dream.Graduation day at U of I. Reservations were made far in advance. We had a 9pm reservation with a $50 required deposit. When we walked in a few minutes before 9, we found ourselves shoulder to shoulder with angry and annoyed patrons. We spoke to several people who had been waiting to be seated 1, 2, and even 2 and a half hours AFTER their reservation time. They know how to take a reservation, just not how to keep the reservation. And that's really the most important part of the reservation.So, due to the $50 required credit card deposit, all those people were stuck waiting and waiting and waiting. After waiting an hour, we asked what would happen if we left, and they said they would charge us $50. I'm pretty sure this wouldn't hold up in a court of law, but the small claims filing fee is more than $50 so they have people hooked. When we were finally seated an hour and a half after our \"reservation\" time, the 5 of us were squished into a small booth with a chair at the end. There was no space for that chair. It was very uncomfortable. Were our drinks comped? Were we offered anything for our long wait? No. The server was very nice, but we were starved and exhausted and really annoyed. The food was great, but way overpriced. I had \"little parcels\" pasta filled with cheese. Really great. The taste was worth 5 stars. I find management's policy on the U of I graduation date coupled with their failure to keep reservations absolutely unacceptable. It is completely unnecessary, their restaurant would be packed skipped reservations or not. The management decided to take this opportunity to swindle people.",

The restaurant's ambience is just about perfect, with romantic lighting and a beautiful garden room that's just breathtaking (more on that in a minute).There are some complaints on here about the food, but I think it's delicious.  I haven't had anything here I didn't like.  One of my favorites is a salad, whose name escapes me at the moment, made with field greens, goat cheese, toasted walnuts, dried cherries, and a champagne vinaigrette dressing.  It's simply divine; I could be happy with just that.  However, it just keeps getting better.  I think the chefs are pretty creative, although the menu hasn't changed much in the three years I've lived here.  The desserts are excellent, as is the wine selection.I've heard that brunch is fabulous, but we've only been for lunch once and dinner a handful of times.  They put on quite a show for New Year's Eve, with a special menu and a generally festive atmosphere.  It was New Year's Eve 2004 that my sweetie and I were sitting in that gorgeous garden room, enjoying a night out on the town, when all of a sudden, a diamond ring was staring me in the face, and my sweetie was down on one knee asking me to marry him.  Now, Silvercreek isn't directly responsible for one of the happiest nights of my life, but they certainly helped make it as perfect as it was, and for that, I thank them.",

Unfortunately in the past 5-10 years the quality has just not been there.  The restored mill building is beautiful and if you've never been there it's worth a visit just for the architecture.  But I keep hoping for a better dining experience for the money and being disappointed.",

It was a very expensive meal for something I could not eat.  Next time a salad for me.  I only went for the music and I guess that's what I got:(",

The selection is smaller than what you would get at other buffets, but the quality of the food blows all the others away. I would say that it even rivals other non-buffet restaurants in terms of the quality of the food. I liked their prime ribs and croissants, they were very fresh, a new batch being brought out once every fifteen minutes. The ribs were flavorful and not under or overcooked in my opinion. Some people may find some of the slices of meat to be too undercooked, but there are plenty to choose from. One thing that was kind of disappointing is the selection of fruits. There was plenty of meats, vegetables, and baked goods to choose from, but I found the selection of fruits kind of lacking. Their website showed a whole platter of fruits with various melons berries, etc, but there was only a bucket of oranges and lemons (yes whole lemons) that you had to peel yourself. I would expect pictures to be slightly exaggerated, but this is a little too much. Even cheap buffets like Ichiban Chinese Buffet or Hometown will have slices of ready to eat fruit. Just that felt like a glaring hole, considering the price and the otherwise great food and service.The service is definitely above average and my water was refilled often, and the waiter was prompt at taking my used plates. I felt comfortable eating at Silvercreek, with the restaurant being clean and the friendly staff. Overall a really nice restaurant, but one star off for the lack of fruits and higher price.",

                "review": "When I come to UI in 1990 as an undergrad, other than the country clubs and Kennedy's/Rick's: An American Cafe and Timpone's, Silvercreek was really THE place to go.  The space is still lovely.  I thought the food quite good until maybe the late 90's.  Several chefs have come and gone recently (last few years).  I have had lunch/dinner here a few times over the last, say, 6 months, and it has been decent.  Nothing too stellar, but not horrible.  The menu gets tweaked more frequently.  HOWEVER - today I stopped by for brunch at about 12:40, it is scheduled to go until 2:30.  Brunch at the Silvercreek of old was very good - lots of salad and hot items, bustling crowd.  It wasn't too crowded, but I was saddened at the brunch I saw.  VERY limited salad items (though the dressing was good).  Mostly very standard breakfast fare, except that the scrambled eggs were somewhat brown (not from brown eggs, either).  Very few hot items, either - some brisket, the kind you would put on a bun, fried chicken (boring), and some salty, rapidly cooling prime rib and ham.  Desserts were unmemorable as well, including a key lime pie that had so much green food coloring in it that I wondered if one of the ingredients was green food coloring.  The trifle I had and the cheesecake were lackluster.  To top it off, I saw my server three times - once for my inital drink, once to clear plates, and once for the bill (which was wrong, I was charged for 2 buffets!) .  Never asked how things were - breezy and unprofessional.  Come on Silvercreek, there are too many other good brunch choices in town, including Luna and Jim Gould (best brunch in town as far as I am concerned, though I don't think they do other meals well).  I think the owner is too busy with his car collection to oversee his eating establishments.  I have not been very impressed with the Courier lately, either (same owner).",

Need I say more.  (Though a bit strange that they put a maraschino cherry in the mimosa.)  They have a nice omelette and waffle station that  the men enjoyed.  The buffet is filled with lots of hot options and a small table of cold items.  The hot table included two types of scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, vegetable, two types of potatoes (the sweet potatoes au gratin were outstanding), fried chicken, salmon and a carving station with both ham and prime rib.  I always enjoy a nice piece of prime rib with horseradish cream sauce.  The dessert bar had a nice selection too, including a hot chocolate bread pudding that was absolutely decadent.",

The wait staff is mostly very young and not quite experienced enough to pull off the fine dining experience.

That said, this is a great place for a big celebratory dinner with your whole family. It's a beautiful setting, the wine and beer lists are good, and your grandmother will be able to find something she wants to eat.

We both agreed that the chicken was really yummy and juicy, anwhile their halibut was well cooked and moist, I found it a bit tasteless (plus a on the more expensive for what you got).The ambiance is quite romantic (both inside and out), but you don't need to dress up unless you want (I was just in shorts, a tee, and a fleece), and it's just a nice place for a quiet dinner.I'm going between 3 and 4 stars here, but I until I try their brunch, I'll have to say 3.",

OK I always thought that Silvercreek was a good place to go if you were A) Old, B) White, and C) middle-class and want to feel good  about your middle-classness. Which is why I never went, because I A) Feel old, B) am really white and C am horribly middle class. I don't like to go places where I all I see is clones of myself, but we went to Silvercreek for the first time 10 days ago, and have already been back another time since!First things first, the decor will suit anyone's parents, but isn't so stuffy and lame that you want to rip the crocheted crap off the walls and scream. The service is good, although knowledge of the wine list could be better (from both servers so far). The menu is really interesting, with a lot of options, and some cool creative twists on some meals which would otherwise be your typical American bistro fare. Prices are worth it, HUGE portions (generally speaking-but the pork chop especially is Massive and the Hangar steak notsomuch).I fully intend on going back, frequently.",

We had called ahead initially to Longhorn Steakhouse (my mother's favorite) who informed us they wouldn't accept a party our size. A sibling and I had each had very good experiences with Silvercreek and were able to persuade my mother. This is now her favorite restaurant.",

I've always noted good service and the food is very good, especially the house-made breads.  This past weekend we tried the brunch for the first time and were delighted!  It is quite an extravagant lunch with MANY options, and they were constantly refilling the trays so everything was fresh!  The waffles were fantastic, light and fluffy, the salads were fresh, and the hot items were flavorful.  I was struck, as a vegetarian, with how many green vegetable options I had!  Brussels sprouts, broccoli, zucchini with cherry tomatoes, spinach salad, cucumber salad!  For meat eaters, there were all sorts of coldcuts, fish and seafood, fried chicken, beef and ham.  And save room for dessert, there are almost as many dessert items available as there are main course, so many cakes!  Along with tarts, candy, apple crisp, bread pudding (which wasn't very good, the only thing I didn't like at all), trifle and fruit.  This is the perfect place to bring visiting family or have a nice brunch out with friends.  Service for us was good, though I did have a bit of a wait once for a water refill.  The only thing that was kind of surprising was the treatment of the line/where the buffet is set up, it's not ideal but it seems to work so-so.",

We started with the corn chowder which was filling and nuanced.  My husband had the special pork tenderloin and my daughter and I had the vegetable ravioli - rich and delicious.  Plus the best bread basket in town.I was a tad diaspointed in the chocolate cake - beautiful but the taste was dull.  That cake looked so much better than it tasted.  Had the dessert been better, this would be a five.

Based on the good reviews and seemingly more upscale menu, I thought this would be a nicer restaurant with good decor and great food. Well, not so much. My friend and I showed up around 7:30 on a Friday night and the place was only about half full. That should have been our first hint. The restaurant has a rather strange look what with the exposed brick and ceiling beams combined with the country-style tables, carpet, and booths. Overall, it just looked a little dated and old, especially the booths that were in a bit of disrepair. The dinner menu isn't huge and has a handful of selections for seafood, steaks, and pasta. I opted for the potato-crusted whitefish. It came with a cream sauce, asparagus, mushrooms, and carrots. It came out nicely presented, but when I lifted up the outer potato crust and got a glimpse of the actual fish I was so annoyed. I'm not exaggerating in the slightest when I say that piece of fish was 2x2 inches. Maybe you're not supposed to notice that with all the potato lumped on top of it, but at $18 that was absolutely ridiculous. My friend said her lobster mac and cheese was good, but so rich she could only eat half. And, BTW, it was corkscrew pasta, not macaroni.Sadly, I didn't order a salad because those actually looked pretty good. And there was also a good looking maple banana cake, but I refused to spend any more money there so I can't attest to the desserts. Overall, this place is way, way overpriced and I would never go back.",

There was nothing sweet, plum, or berry about it, and certainly nothing flavorful enough about it for me to tell you if it was organic.  I want my $2.75 plus $0.50 metered parking fee back, thank you very much.In my less cantankerous moods, decent coffee (they carry Intelligentsia beans, but none of the supposedly godly Los Delirios), decent pastries, free wifi, but overall pricey as hell (something about the fees for green coffee going up).  Combined with the hordes of happy chirpy undergrads that frequent this place, I'll be taking my business somewhere else.",

They serve Intelligentsia, which is an excellent call on their part. It's one of my favorite coffees and the people working seem to know how to properly make their coffee as well. With some other unnamed local coffee shops raising their prices but still turning out burnt tasting and inconsistent espresso, this should really be your first choice locally.I've never had their food, but it has a good reputation as far as I know.",

College students monopolize tables for hours, so good luck finding a seat on the weekends and afternoons.  If you are not averse to meeting strangers, most people are willing to share their table if asked.Paradiso also can't seem to hold onto owners.  If you ever come here and feel slighted by the service, wait a few months and the management will have been replaced.  Each owner makes few changes to the menu, though you'll see their personal touches elsewhere (the current one seems to love those hand-painted, ceramic houses that grandmothers collect).In spite of its quirks, Paradiso is the best place in town for coffee and espresso.  They serve Intelligentsia Coffee, which is unrelentingly bold and rich; if you hold the coffee to the light you'll see that it is completely opaque.  After a cup, I usually feel as though I just had a particularly filling breakfast.Like most cafes, the food is bland and expensive, but suffices if you have managed to acquire a table and don't want to risk losing it by leaving for real food.  The best part of sandwiches is the bread, which is provided by Mirabelle (a fine bakery in Urbana).  Chips are usually smashed into a coarse dust before being served.  I've had the best luck with the pasta salad, though it is only offered in the summer and some of its variations are fairly terrible (any \"pesto\" version can be considered safe).",

Service is as bad as ever, which I used to be happy to overlook because the food and coffee were so great. Now the soups are being over-seasoned with heavy handed doses of curry powder, dill, and what tastes like artificial smoke flavoring, but ironically lack salt and pepper.  The vegetables and legumes are also usually undercooked (we're talking crunchy peas) while the pasta is overcooked and mushy. Their soups used to consistently wow me, but I can't remember the last time I had one that was even passable. Sandwich fixings are being poorly cut so you end up with things like half inch thick cucumber slices and bread of wildly different sizes on either side of the sandwich. Portion sizes are also shrinking to the point of ridiculousness, and the cup of soup for (i believe) $3.50 is becoming increasingly offensive.   Prices overall have gotten pretty nuts.  Today I spent over $12 on a half sandwich/soup combo with which I was given very little soup, a pastry, and a bottle of water that they didn't actually ever give me.  It was pretty much the nail in the coffin for my Paradiso lunch habit.Paradiso, please take note! You were once my favorite place for lunch and had soup so good I was willing to wait forever to get it. Please get your act together so I can love you again!",

I have not been able to find a coffee shop that I actually like.This may be because I'm outgrowing \"hanging out at coffee shops.\" I might also just be too busy, or more comfortable at home.At any rate - Paradiso is not just a cafe - it's an institution. Everyone who has ever gone there regularly knows this, and most can just sense it from being inside. There are some things it could do better with: some of the furniture is a little uncomfortable, sometimes the music is a little loud. At the end of the day, though, this place is a slice of your life in Champaign.I remember fondly the smokiness (although I no longer smoke), the cramped Rentertainment, the progressive expansion, the awkward open mic night experiments, the pasta nights, the yard sales, the employees, the friends I made and met there, regularly, day in and day out. I did a lot of growing up there and for good reason. It's a great environment. They really do most everything right. 1. Product: you can stand by product quality! Intelligentsia coffee, Mirabelle pastries and breads. Good business practice means knowing how to make money without cutting the wrong corners. The owner knows what she's doing.2. Service: baristas know how to make drinks! Seriously! This place has a hipster feel of course - but most of the hipster baristas I run across in Chicago are too busy trying to be cool and can't actually make drinks. The baristas at Paradiso are cool, and are competent at customer service and drink making. Again, the owner knows what she's doing.3. Environment: It's close to class, but not that close to class. It's close to dorms, but not that close to dorms. There's nice, tree-lined Urbana to your east. I heard lots of albums for the first time there. And there's a chance you'll make a friend or two. Not to mention, really comfortable bathrooms. I know that seems strange to say, but when you're on your 10th cup of coffee on a study binge, the bathrooms better feel right.I really should write more, but that would be more of a memoir, than a review. Just suffice to say, the place is great.",

You can also get a sandwich and pick the bread and ingredients. It's good but tastes like a regular sandwich, nothing special.Only problem is the cluttery and inconvenient set up. Simplify it! Too many tables and chairs. Oh, and the multiple surgeprotectors dotted across the floor are annoying. You have cords coming from multiple tables in that one surge protector which can be a hazard.

I think it's worth it, especially when I'm planning to sit for awhile and essentially renting table space. Many disagree.* The best time to write at Paradiso is during breaks or in the summer when campus empties out. During the semester, it can be loud and hard to get a table, and the internet is slow when there's a ton of students procrastinating by watching youtube.* The food is fine, but generally unexceptional. The pastries and soups are the best bet (macarons and corn chowder - yum! - not together, of course), and they  always have a variety of vegetarian options.",

The coffee is routinely overly bitter due to it being brewed with too hot water. They pre-grind beans and let them sit around for hours at a time. Finally, it's pretty clear that they are brewing a weak cup (not enough ground coffee per pot). On occasion I'll ask for the coffee of the day just after it has run out. They will start brewing a new pot and pour me a cup before the pot has finished brewing. Only then is the coffee even remotely close to its potential. I started ordering americanos in the hopes of getting something a bit more flavorful, but the aforementioned too hot water blew out the flavor of the espresso. The sandwiches are good, but inconsistent. Sometimes the bread is fresh, sometimes not. Sometimes they will pack the sandwich full of veggies, often not.Finally, the prices...I write this as I sit in a cafe in seattle where I just paid $3 for a perfect latte. $3 gets you a mediocre cup of coffee and that is not right. Paradiso, if you are listening, adjust your water temp, clean your water filter, up the amount of coffee you grind per pot, grind your beans fresh, and drop you prices by about 75 cents for your drinks across the board. Intelligentsia should refuse to sell beans to cafes that treat their beans so poorly.",

I should have said something, but I tweeted my disdain instead...I love getting the vegan soups there. So tasty and comes with yummy pieces of bread. It feels better since they give you so much in huge pretty bowls that also heighten the experience.Their sandwiches are huge and filled with lots of veggies.They make great flavoured drinks such as the mayan mocha (spicy cinnamon mocha). AND they use Monin brand syrup which is a huge plus for me because I do not like Torani and DaVinci is the worst. That's my personal preference.This place has the best soy mochas in my opinion. The mixture of the intelligentsia espresso and soy makes a great nutty combination.I almost forgot! They serve a mean affogato! Espresso, icecream, whipped cream, those tasty small almond cookies. I wish places here would do it like caffe paradiso instead of just giving me gelato and espresso.The pastries from mirabelle's are amazing. I recommend the alligator and bear claw.

I remember being there one night at about 5am and the owner came in and made a large batch of scrambled eggs for everyone that was still there (for free).  Ever since, I get a warm fuzzy feeling thinking of the place.I always go back whenever I am in Urbana, though it's been a few years.  I hope it is still cool.",

That parking situation--there are a few, coveted spots out front dedicated for customers, and then otherwise you fight street parking--is perhaps the only downside to this location.",

Of the past 4 times I tried to get a sandwich (their primary lunch/dinner option), they have only had it available 1 time.  Each time they were out, I was told it was because they ran out of bread.  When they did have it, it ws a good sandwich (I recommend the ham + all vegetables), but the seeming unreliability is quite an issue for me.",

I ended up grabbing an iced coffee before making myself comfortable at one of their two person tables.  The iced coffee was pretty standard, but I would agree with some fellow Yelpers in saying that I felt like paying over $3.50 for a pretty average cup of iced coffee was a little bit overpriced.  The decor was nice with marble tables, mismatched chairs, and interesting wall decorations. Something that I really liked about Caffe Paradiso was that it really attracts people from all walks of life with the majority expectedly being students; it made for some very nice subtle people-watching.  I think that it's a nice spot on the border of the U of I campus, but, in comparison to the other coffee shops that I've checked out in Chambana since arriving last week this one doesn't top my list.",

By no means would I call myself a chef, but I cook enough to know that the ingredients and preparation of their food is definitely not worth the price. The sandwiches are priced at about $7 and they are nothing spectacular. They are literally something you could make out of oscar Mayer deli meat, county market white bread, a slice of cheese, a slice of tomato. The two times I ordered a sandwich it was grilled and came to me so crispy and crunchy you could hear throughout the whole cafe when I would bite. I've eaten carrots that were less crunchy.

The end note on both these drinks was quite sour and throughout the drink, the mouth feel was not very full. I was quite disappointed in full knowledge that their brew and cold brew taste delicious...hopefully they can fix this. My girlfriend has had the same experiences in the past...her coffees were sour and not brewed properly",

When the cashier had to reverify practically everything, I thought she was just being thorough, but I guess I should have taken it as a warning sign. First we received the wrong size. Not a big deal, we just asked for the right size. Then, the woman who was handling the cashier poured the small drinks into the large cups, and then topped them off with an ample amount of soy milk, turning the drink into a completely different drink than what we ordered (think vaguely chocolatey coffeey soy milk). When my boyfriend went to ask her a question about the drinks, she was off-putting and didn't stick around long to talk (probably because she knew the criticism ahead). We decided it wasn't worth complaining anymore, so we left with our $5 chocolate soy milks and will not be going back.",

They have free wifi, but everyone connects to power strips and extension cords that are strewn about haphazardly.  Watch out so you don't trip.  And people would unplug your computer if you weren't paying attention.  It looks more like a dorm area than a business.The tables and chairs are mismatched, which I'm sure is the style they're going for.  It would be cute if it just had something a little more to connect everything together, instead of a bunch of furniture thrown in.  It looks like left-overs from the dorms and frats that surround the area.  And it was sort of dirty.  Like dusty.  And the windows weren't clean.  And flies.  I can't stand trying to study with flies buzzing around me.  It's sort of the little things that can make a place be \"wow.\"  And the coffee was, in my opinion, rather overpriced.  Very good, but I was a little miffed at paying over $2 for a 16 oz. house coffee.  I guess because it's closer to the school they can over charge.  But my friend loves that brand of coffee, so we go there.I don't know, the potential is totally there.  It would be better if they kept it cleaner and more organized, and wiped the tables down on occassion.  But they do seem to have good hours - open until 11pm I think.  And the people behind the counter were nice.",

I hadn't even bothered to try them until my boyfriend ordered them one night.  I tried almost every flavor.  My favorites were the roasted chicken and chicken inferno, but I also liked the potato cheddar,sausage pizza, and san telmo carne/pollo.  They are best if you get there when they're fresh, have them made for you (takes about 10 minutes), or get delivery.  I think I ordered them about once a week for 3 years until I moved away. Now, I still crave them and have even resorted to trying to make my own......which are not nearly as good I might add.",

The sausage pizza was nothing special (a bit on the greasy side), and better can be easily found in the area.  Nevertheless, the empanadas are good enough to warrant a trip.",

The sliced pizza is well-priced, thin crust and yummy, not to mention relatively creative in the flavor department so I would recommend this to the hungry passing by.

Empanadas are a little over $2 for each pocket of yum but don't let that stop you. There are deals like \"pick 6\" where you get a little discount for volume purchasing. Sometimes there are deals on Hooked or Grub Hub as well. The pizza is also delicious. It's NY style pizza so it's thin crust that's toasted when you place an order. Spotted Goat is a popular selection but my favourite is still a plain cheese slice. The place is tiny & it can get crowded in the evenings, especially if there's stuff going on at Canopy Club or Krannert. Cleanliness is not their forte. I've seen someone touch their hair then work the pizza dough with their hands. I don't like to think about that.",

The veggies tasted fresh sliced, the bacon was crispy, and there were big chunks of chicken.  It was one of the best pizzas I've had.  Not super cheap for a pizza at about $18 but so, so good.So some of the best pizzas are the specialty ones on the menu, and not just the ready-made ones under the heat lamps.  So now I say: 5 stars for the pizza, 3 for the empanadas.The pizza is - for my money - the best of its kind on campus, and certainly the best within an easy walk from the quad.  The prices per slice seemed a little high until I went to Sbarro and got a much more disappointing slice for more money.  I won't do that again.Here they usually have the traditional pizzas - cheese, sausage, pepperoni - but the standouts are their more unusual toppings.  My other favorite is the hungry goat, which has tomato, basil, mushrooms, and goat cheese.  A little bit of hot sauce from the counter and you have the perfect greasy mid-day snack.  There are other interesting options that seem to rotate - a potato pizza, a mushroom pizza, a Mexican themed pizza, and the supreme are the ones I remember from last time.  I've also seen apple butter pizza and the barbecue meats, which is good stuff.The pizza slices are about 10 inches long and 4.5 wide.  It's a more floppy, chewy pizza.  The cheeses and toppings vary, and it's usually a little greasy - though of course, it depends on what type you get.  When you order it goes in the oven to warm up.The empanadas are okay but leave me more hungry than the pizza.  I am not that great a fan of empanadas, though.  I didn't notice a huge difference between the different fillings.  I haven't tried the dessert ones, but I am told they are good.Convenient and consistently pretty good.",

While I haven't eaten through the amazing range of items Manolo's offers, I am confident Manolo's is the best of the two.Pizza places are ubiquitous on college campuses, so I'm never too excited when one springs up. Manolos sets itself apart by having empandas, which are an excellent alternative to pizza. They have several types ranging from the more authentic spicy San Telmo Carne to flaming potato. The three types I tried were tasty and the pastry was puffy and soft. They are perfect for an on-the-go snack since they can easily be eaten while walking.As for the pizza? The cheese pizza I tried was good and had a nice crust.  Hands down the best pizza there (and the reason for the recently added extra star) is the fresh basil and mozzarella. I had it with some friends and we all agreed it was top-notch. It's fragrant from the very fresh basil and the cheese stands out as being so much better than regular pizza cheese. Specialty pizzas are a little bizarre. The one I tried, creamy chicken gorgonzola, was sans red sauce. It wasn't bad, but it was like some cheese, chicken, spinach, and (good) portabellas on dough. More like upscale breadsticks than pizza. Make sure the description says it has red sauce if you are looking for something traditional. Ditto the other reviewer- They make their food! Surprisingly enough, this is actually unusual. Many restaurants buy pre-made items from big companies, but here at Manolos you can see them rolling the dough for all the pizza and empanadas.Delivery is slow and expensive. Pick up is the better option.",

(Okay, maybe not get married, but we could hang out.

The Modena was definitely the standout, but again, I would trust goat cheese with my firstborn.

My mom ordered their spinach and ricotta empanada, but when she bit into hers, it looked like it had some kind of soy meat or real meat. Hard to tell, and I don't want to think about it too much! All I know is they definitely gave us one meaty empanada when we ordered two vegetarian ones-- major problem!!They also had a lot of problems charging our credit card. They tried three times, and we got all these fraud alerts afterward.BUT they were running a deal where you got a free medium cheese pizza when you spent $10... And they gave us two! (We did spend over $40).My brother was really excited to share this place with us, and he doesn't get excited about too much food-wise, so that of course made the whole experience a full star better!",

Otherwise, plain cheese is good enough.I've had the empanadas, and they're also pretty good. Problem is, they're too expensive for what you get. More than $7 for three measly little pockets of meat/cheese/veggies is a bit much. I suppose the San Termo style empanadas warrant a try, but for the more standard varieties, I wouldn't bother.

They take a slice from the carousel on the bar and stick it in the oven for a minute or so. Take a look at what is on the carousel before you order to make sure it looks good and not all orange/cancer bubbly or burnt. They also have parm cheese, red pepper, and hot sauce. I guess it is probably not 4 stars good, but there really is nothing like booze and pizza in a music venue that often smells rather strongly of *ahem* the perennial accoutrement of musicians. Kind of like how a nice afternoon at Wrigley makes Old Style taste like truffle butter infused ambrosia.",

One let out a guffaw and snorted, \"Look, [person B], that Korean girl is checking you out. Hahahaha...\" First of all, I'm Chinese American. If you're going to judge my ethnicity, at least get it right. Second of all, who treats a paying customer like a gawking idiot like they did?

You have your filling - usually some kind of meat, some spices, onions, make it the night before, stick it in the fridge - and you have your shells - usually made out of masa harina. When you're ready to serve them you plop a spoonful onto the shell, roll it up, squeeze the edges and drop them into the fryer.It's not haute cuisine. Every culture has some kind of dough-and-filling staple whether it be Polish pierogis or Chinese dumplings. It's so basic it's hard to believe anyone could fuck it up.Unfortunately, someone has. These are, by far, the worst dough-and-filling creations I've ever had. The dough was soggy, the filling was dry, it was paradoxically bland and salty. The mushrooms in the mushroom and cheese empanada tasted like they were on the verge of going bad. Also, they should be fried. Not baked. Granted, I ate the empanadas during Thanksgiving break when not many students are on campus so maybe the management didn't really think it'd be worth it to make fresh empanadas. Then again, empanadas should never be made hours beforehand to sit under a heat lamp. You want to save money? Close up shop instead of serving an inferior product.Finally, it was overpriced (3 little empanadas for 6 bucks) and the service was lousy. The place felt kind of disorganized and grimy, the employees were lackadaisical. I don't expect the corporate shine and whitewash of a Jimmy John's. A little dirt can be ok, I appreciate texture, but I also like a little bit more professionalism. If the owner wants to make some real money I'd say get rid of the pizza, get rid of all the empanda options except for maybe the top two flavors (a spicy ground pork one Colombian style and maybe a vegetarian option), reduce your staff, get an industrial deep fryer, drop the price of each empanada to $2, make it three for $5, offer free salsa to top on the empanadas and stay open really late on the weekends. Let the smell of the fried goodness waft over the street and watch people line up outside of your door. Empanadas are blue-collared, street food in Latin America. They're also great when you're drunk or high and got the munchies. This place should be so much better.",

Their late hours and delivery option make it very convenient, but I find the prices to be too high for what you get. The pizza is pretty good and each slice is fairly large. They have a wide selection of empanadas, including vegetarian and dessert options. My favorite empanada is the chocolate brownie, and I also really like the apple and spinach mushroom manicotti ones. The more empanadas you order, the better deal you can get. You can also find special deals online or on apps like 'Hooked' that can help save you some money. Manolo's is good for a small treat and definitely worth stopping by if you are in the area.",

I recommend the Spotted Goat pizza, it's crispy and delicious after being reheated to perfection. The empanadas are very mediocre. They are tiny, but have a very thick crust (0.5 to 0.7 cm). I prefer the empanadas from a new food truck called Empanada house, where the crust is about 2 mm thick and the filling isn't dry. I had to dock it 2 stars through because the price is just too damn high ($10+ for a slice of pizza and 2 empanadas). I suggest going to Canopy Club Monday night when they sell Manolo's slices for $1. Sure it's been out the whole day, but you can drown that remorse in $1 PBRs and the sweet sounds of amateur house music.",

I usually just go down there after work to pick up our order.I've had the BBQ Meats, Chicken Pesto, and the Supreme pizzas, and all were pretty decent.  Large slice thin crust (ala NY style), and they have a LOT of interesting combinations available.  For empanadas, the Inferno Chicken is by far my favorite.  I've tried several others as well and they are just ok.   The only ones on the menu that I tried and did not like was the Potato Cheddar and Raspberry Cheesecake.  They were just a mushy mess with not much flavor.  The empanadas are not really budget-friendly if you're getting them in quantity (2-2.50 each).  I don't normally get slices, but the whole pizza are just slightly above average compared to other places in town.Beware when trying to pick up an order if there is a popular show at the Canopy Club, because finding a place to park nearby is difficult if the show crowd is around.If you're tired of all the chain places in town, this is a nice choice to change things up.",

We also got 3 empanadas for $6 to go with it, delivery time was about an hour, which is to be expected on a weekend. This amount of food was just enough for our group of 3 in terms of portions.The pizza was decent, definitely better than a Papa John's or similar chain. I didn't think it was anything spectacular though. If you like thin crust, this might be for you. It reminded me of Sbarro, except a little better. My issue with this pizza, and perhaps all thin crust/New York style is the lack of sauce. The sauce is so key to the flavor that often times without it your just eating a cheesy breadstick. I might have liked it more if there was a bit more sauce. The pepperoni wasn't that good, however, the sausage was unusually good, it tasted fresh and wasn't just a mushy piece of nothing, great flavor! I think I will get sausage if I order again. The crust was good, crispy bottom but edible edges.Feedback on the empanadas was a unanimous OK. I can only personally speak for the cheesecake empanada. The filling didn't resemble something you could get at The Cheesecake Factory, but it also wasn't just dried goop. Not too bad! I think the empanadas might be a really good bargain if you got a lot of them and the price was around $1 each.I have not tried any of the specialty pizzas and I may have to do that and then update my review. I will also have to try The Empanadas House for a fair comparison.Overall we thought Manolo's was just OK, we thought it might have been just a little pricey, but we were not disappointed with our food.I'll be back!",

Rosati's, Monical's, even Dominoes has attempted the \"thin crust\", but they basically make pizza cracker. But then there's Manolo's!  Their pizza is reminiscent of what I remember as thin crust.  If you're from New England, I guess you would understand if I said their pizza reminded me of Papa Gino's.  A little greasy, but overall a delicious slice.  Their specialty pizzas are also very good.  Got the Spotted Goat (spinach, mushroom, mozzerella, gorgonzola, goat cheese, roasted garlic alfredo sauce and red sauce).  Fantastic.  If you're looking for a \"NY/Boston\" style thin crust pizza... you'll appreciate Manolo's.  It's not home for sure, but it does the trick.",

A medium specialty pizza is $14.99, but I think this has more to do with my perception of the cost of pizza, living in a college town.

Oh, and free wifi as well!One star off for their relatively limited hours...only open till 9 M-Sat, and till 5 (ouch!) on Sundays.",

Kopi's is on par for comparison, but I think I like Pekara's more because it's served in a porcelain cup...something about it is more pleasant that way. The bakery is delicious, but the sandwiches are a little too salty/heavy for my taste. The same goes for the soups; tasty, but way too rich and creamy. That's a preference thing and I'm sure many people will like it, but just in case others are sensitive to textures, there it is.Overall, it's not a super-special kinda coffee shop, but for downtown Champaign, it does well, and its a local business with awesome staff that I feel really good about supporting. I also think it trumps downtown urbana shops by a long shot; looking at you Flying Machine.",

If I try and go on a diet, bread is one thing that I cannot give up. I love it so!!  Pekara is now my go-to spot for bread at the market. The wide selection of bread and baked goods immediately catches your eye. In a glass case, there are croissants and other goodies.  Next the case is a table filled with fresh baked breads that all look mouthwatering. I have purchased the Herb Focaccia and the Baguette.  Woah, both were amazing!!! The Focaccia had the perfect amount of rosemary and salt on it and it was perfect for dipping in some olive oil with parmesan cheese.  The baguette had a rustic look to it and had the right amount of crustiness.   It went great with the Italian Wedding Soup I made for dinner that evening. The gentleman at the stand is also very nice and I will for sure be a regular customer from here on out! Thanks Pekara!!",

With that said, there's also a lack of upscale cafe/bakeries in general in the area so it's not a bad place to visit for breakfast if you're around.",

                "review": "First, the things Pekara does well. I frequently encounter quiche with an unappetizing dense, crumbling texture, so I was absolutely over the moon when I discovered Pekara's quiche lorraine--instead of a piece of dried-out egg cake, the filling is so superbly soft and velvety that it literally melts in your mouth. At the Urbana farmers' market, I'll stop by their stall and pick up a filled croissant, which are always crisp and flaky beyond belief (not the sad, soggy pastries that croissants can sometimes be). I also crave their savory roasted red pepper and Gouda soup--but I bet they buy it packaged from some wholesaler as I've eaten nearly identical versions at several other places in town.Next, the things I'm not so happy with. One morning I decided to stop in and pick up some treats for my workplace's coffee hour. Thinking it'd probably be a good bulk investment, I opted for a loaf of the pumpkin bread, which came out to more than $10. I've been able to pick up a loaf at other bakeries in town for around $5, so I was admittedly shocked, especially because the bread was very dry and not particularly special in any way. Some of their baked goods are fairly inconsistent in quality--so much that I've sometimes wondered if they switched owners/bakers. Recently, they've made attempts to introduce some of the classic items you'd see in a New York Italian bakery, but unfortunately their attempts lack heart. It's as if some of the cookies weren't properly taste-tested before making it to the shelves.For Pekara, I'd recommend the savory items (omelettes, sandwiches, salads, quiches) over the sweets.",

Unfortunately, the reason for the low review was the price.  I paid something like $8 for a sandwich on two of the smallest slices of sourdough bread I've ever seen and a handful of chips.  I felt ridiculously ripped off, and was left feeling hungry.  Actually, quite a few of my co-workers with more money in their pockets ended up buying seconds just to fill their appetites.  It took a little while for the food to come out as well.  The sandwich wasn't bad, just very average and ridiculously overpriced.  Soup and salad were the same.   I'll be staying away.",

Their crepes had too much cream and the cream was very strong, over powering the crepes. Strawberries weren't ripe, so a little sour in taste and the crepe was just ok. Overall, the taste wasn't pleasing and I will only be coming here if I have to, or for their bakery items.",

I went with my wife and son so we sampled a lot of things;I got both a plain croissant and a chocolate croissant (which they should have labeled \"pain au chocolat\"!).  The plain one was good but the chocolate one had the bread all wrong.My son got a cheese omelete but it was kind of hard on the outside and he didn't like it.My wife got the chicken pesto crepe, which she said was good.We also had some samples of a brownie they had out on the table.  You order at the counter and they give you a number to put on the table and then bring out the food to you when it's ready.The location is nice (and there's an outdoor part out back).  Bathroom was clean.Prices are a little high but there are some less expensive items on the menu.  Nothing really wrong with this place, I feel like there's more on the menu to try and I'll probably find a favorite.   I will probably end up checking it out again if I am in the area after I have tried a few other places on my list first.A 3-star type establishment.",

Besides amazing pastries, they have delicious sandwiches. The Cuban and Hot Chicken sandwiches are my favourites. Omelettes & crpes are meh. There's a decent selection of fresh bread too. I like the jalapeo cheese pretzels & ciabatta when they're available. The baguettes have been hard & stale on occasion. I like to go in for an espresso & a sandwich before I work night shift. I get a pastry to go or pick up one in the morning when I get off work. For ambiance, there's a rotation selection of artwork. It's often loud inside & not conducive of conversation. The baristas are sometimes attentive & sometimes they just ignore me until I flag them down. All in all, I like their pastries & some of the sandwiches, but it's not my favourite place to hang. This place is kinda hit or miss.",

My favorite soups are the tomato and red pepper bisques, and they've gone out of their way to heat some up even if it's not on the day's menu which is really going the extra mile. I've had their turkey, blt and mushroom sandwiches and all were very tasty. Their breads are really great, too and you can't beat the price for a half soup and half sandwich at lunch. The best thing are the portion sizes! When Penara or Atlanta Bread Co. give you a half sandwich it's more like a 1/4 sandwich. There are times at Pekara i can't imagine how large a full sandwich would be! I haven't tried much of their baked goods but they look amazing.",

But...Baklava was dry, squished, and tasted stale.The crepes almost tasted raw and was almost rubbery to the texture.But the worst travesty was the Turkish coffee they had, which isn't really real Turkish coffee. They put a tiny cezve and the cup on a large plate; in reality they should be serving it already in the cup with the grounds already settled, without the cezve; there should be an accompanying glass of cold water (without ice), and finally it shouldnt be served with sugar cubes. The only way to truly sweeten Turkish coffee is during the brewing process when you are heating the cezve over the fire. Which means they should ask you how much sugar they want upon ordering it. Even were I to ignore this blatant trampling on the etiquette of Turkish coffee, it just tasted like incompletely made Nescafe put into a cezve and served lukewarm. Distinctly under-average establishment.",

The sourdough was vaguely stale and warm, but it was not clear that it had been toasted. The cheese had been melted on the bread, not the meat; there was a single, sad slice that didn't even cover all of the sourdough. The ham was overly salty, cut thick. Nothing else comes on the sandwich -- the bread isn't clearly buttered, pressed, or anything. No condiments. Just generally unappetizing. In retrospect I should have asked for a refund.This is the most recent sandwich disappointment. I don't think I'll make the mistake of getting anything that isn't pure sugar again.",

Hardly any foam. and then, i wanted to try something sweet so i ordered a cannoli. yeah. could not have been more disappointed. I paid almost 5 bucks for a small cannoli and it was like paper soaked in water. very heavy in texture. Could not finish it.

I went for the smoked salmon pizza, which came with cucumber and dill cream cheese... a somewhat unusual and unexpected combination, but it wasn't bad and it was pretty cheap ($8 or so?). I'm guessing this might be better place for lunch than it is for dinner. I'll probably give it another try sometime soon.",

It is one of a very few that actually MAKE their food, including breads, baked goods, crepes, soups, sandwiches, individual pizzas, and salads, in addition to coffee drinks.Pekara has now moved its baking operations to its own dedicated building (now that says something for a local successful biz, doesn't it?) to do more wholesale for local retail establishments (for example, you can find their bread at Common Grounds Food Coop, cookies at the Latte Da coffee shops in the public libraries and Carle on Windsor and baked goods at Pages for All Ages independent bookstore.I like their niche; the desserts are homey, yet professional (and they can do higher level European cakes and pastries). They have THE best spanokopita-type dish (much better than Greek versions-more like a spinach/cheese custard in filo), lovely cupcakes, great combos for soup/salad/sandwiches, and savory croissants. Oh, and did I say individual Babkas? Seating is a smart row of two chair/table setups with plenty of outlets down the hall, with a counter/bar stools in front, and larger table combos, couch/club chairs in the back. Warm weather brings a couple of tables in front, and a bricked patio in the back. The only problems I have seen are: parking (now w/the road closed, but at nights and weekends you can use the bank across the street), and sometimes poor staffing (the owners cannot be there 24/7) although this is to be expected with the high turnover of food service jobs. I have noticed that the past six months have gotten better with a couple of 'managerial'  level employees who are keeping the staff professional. This is a casual, nice place to bring someone for lunch, breakfast, a bit to eat in the evenings, to study, etc. It is not a sit down restaurant, and it can sometimes get complicated if you are eating with a group of four or more and you want to pay the bill for everyone (getting the orders in and together).  Lunchtime can get a bit crowded. Each person orders individually and the staff brings you your meals. The food arrives quickly, even the made to order crepes. They do nice box lunches, catering, and platters as well.",

The girl working there apparently confused \"lemon and cheese danish\" for pumpkin and cream cheese muffin, which she stated they did not have. So I repeated the order, and she got to work. It didn't take too long to get the crepe (less than 5 min), but when my friend ordered, I went up to the counter with her and the girl asked me \"if she could help me\" to which I replied no, I was getting water and talking to my friend. That girl had a serious problem with apathy and attitude. Later, she climbed up into the visible \"attic\" storage and THREW things down (like paper towels, boxes, etc.)The prices could be better, but it was around $12 for a crepe, a pastry, and two cups of coffee. The crepe was really tasty and the coffee was good too, but the pastry was nothing special, I've had better at Panera.",

I asked for milk in coffee and was told the half and half was behind me.  Half and Half is the farthest thing from milk in the universe. Won't be back.",

Upon entering, I was greeted by the friendly cashier. When I asked for her recommendations she gladly offered a variety of her favorite treats and then gave me adequate time to decide what I'd like to try for myself.After much deliberation, I went with the scotch oatmeal cookie that the lovely cashier recommended along with an iced coffee. Just a heads up for anyone interested, their oatmeal cookies are the real deal, made with shortening and lots of love. So while the cookie was the perfect balance of \"crunchy AND chewy\" that the cashier promised it would be, this treat definitely serves as a more once in a while splurge in my book. There were a number of other delicious looking pastries, tiramisu, and cakes on display; it really was tough to choose!My total came to $3.25 which I thought was extremely affordable considering the use of local ingredients and the fact that, at some other coffee shops in town, you'd pay that much alone for a cookie or a coffee separately.I thoroughly enjoyed my cookie, but I also just really enjoyed the space. The noise level was prime for sitting down and getting some studying and busywork done on a lazy Friday late afternoon.The combination of friendly and accommodating staff, delicious products, and the cool bakery/coffee shop ambiance give Pekara a thumbs up in my book. I definitely hope to be back in the next week or two!",

The interior is clean and there is decent amount of space without some outdoor seating. Cashiers were nice and friendly.We enjoyed two crepes, a quiche, and a soup for breakfast. I really liked the quiche here. It's more eggy like an omelet but it was very aromatic with the bacon on the bottom. I think I ordered the Florentine quiche? The crepes are nice as well. It's not a very thin, delicate crepe, but I really liked the sweet cream inside along with the fruit. Its stuffed with the cream and what's nice is that it wasn't too sweet and it had a hint of acidity. I would skip the tomato soup with gouda here. It was too heavy in my taste - almost like a sauce. It does come with a lot of bread though.With it's price point, I'd definitely want to come back when I have the chance!",

Every one of these that I have tried has been very good.They also have really good daily soups (with surprisingly high prices) and good lunches. Their lunches are pretty expensive for what you get, but all sandwiches come on their awesome bread. They make crepes here that are pretty good, but again, the prices are pretty high for what you get. It can get crowded at lunch time, also. They have staff to deliver the meals to your tables after you order at the counter.Coffee comes in little (one size) cups and is often weak. Get your coffee next door at Aroma, people bring product from one cafe to the other all the time.It may seem like I am way too down on this place for a 4 star review, but for what I am looking for (pastries!) they are solid.",

Who else understands how big of a deal this is in urbana champaign?  The hours of 7-7pm also make it perfect for a real breakfast place.

I keep trying because I like the atmosphere more than Aroma or Kopi.  But, the wireless is always spotty. Most recently, last Friday night, the wifi wasn't working at all. We talked to a staff member, and she tried to reset it, but it never ended up working, and we ended up leaving.  The frustrating part is that we had made several purchases, were clearly there to work, and there was no indication prior to ordering that the wifi was having any problems.  I think that in these cases, if wifi is faulty, customers should be given notification before they settle in. This has happened at least twice now.I ordered a pumpkin latte, which was tasty.  The sugar cookie tasted too much like almond extract for my preferences.  I prefer purer tasting sugar cookies.I might return to Pekara in the future for bread or to have a drink when I don't need the Internet to work.",

So this morning came in expecting a delicious meal; because the cookie I had the night before was homemade (plus on Monday's they give you a free chocolate  chip cookie with your purchase). So this morning my omelet was good but the butter croissant was tough. The coffee was good. The tab came to $17; a bit expensive. But I was still thinking a 4 star would be an ok rating for this caffe, that is until I asked for a coffee refill and the women attending the counter said there is a $.50 charge. I read in the menu that is posted on the wall, that  you can have a espresso shot for $.30 added to your cup of coffee. Up to this point I was still ok with their way of conducting business (although it made me appreciate coffee shops in California that refill at no charge). However I had to take the rating down to three stars because once I asked for the refill and a shot of espresso the woman attending the counter said I would have to buy a new cup of coffee. If the owner of this coffee shop reads this review, please note you should change the writing in the large menu  written in the wall and clarify the coffee refill situation. The customer service was also inconsistent the first time (night) I came in to buy my cookie the gentleman attending the counter was great. The next morning I order my $17 omelette, croissant and coffee a nice African American lady took my order. But the woman with very short light brown hair was not customer service oriented when dealing with my coffee refill issue. I came in happy to be a return customer but left not sure if I would return.",

However after that, it began to get expensive. I originally came here for a crepe, and I must say that I think their savory crepes are better than their sweet ones.The Salmon crepe that my friend ordered was good, however, the chocolate banana crepe I ordered was horrible! It was tough to cut through, there wad hardly any nutella or chocolate on it, and it tasted flavorless. I was disappointed.I ordered a fruit tart, which was good (you can't go wrong with those), but pricey. And their French sodas are okay, but also pricey.Since the main reason I came was for the crepe and the crepe I had was terrible, I can't give this rating no more than three stars.",

Paired with a fluffy, buttery croissant, the combination of flavors is wonderful!I have also had the red pepper and smoked gouda bisque, which has been on their specials board for a couple of weeks. So good! And it comes with a generous helping of fresh bakery bread.The only thing I didn't entirely enjoy was a mango smoothie.  This is mainly because it was quite pricey for the quality IMO, since it was made with pre-squeezed mango and other juices from a container, versus using real, fresh fruit.",

I was elated to see that they had filled croissants like spinach and cheese, ham and cheese, and mushroom and cheese. I ordered the ham and cheese with a cup of cocoa - but they mistakenly gave me a mushroom and cheese croissant. I did not complain since I am an equal opportunity eater, but I know if I brought my friend here who is deathly allergic to mushrooms, well, it would have been bad.The croissant itself was beautifully flaky and tasty - not rubbery store-bought crud. I also like how Pekara prides itself in not using preservatives!However, the cocoa was awful - entirely made of Hershey's syrup that congealed at the bottom of the gigantic mug. At least the drink was beautiful.I know I'll be back, but just for the food. Additional tip: They sell half price day old bread.",

But when it's bad, it's terrible.I've had a multitude of mixed experiences here, both in service and food quality. When the baked goods are fresh, some of them can be outstanding. But when they've dried and/or gone stale and they're still selling them, it's like throwing money in the trash. (And sometimes when you ask what's fresh and you get it, it's still sub par.) The bread leaves something to be desired--I do not go here for their bread items.Pekara is not an inexpensive place to eat, either. Sometimes the service is fast and friendly and other times it's indifferent and slow. While most local businesses have a policy for a minimum spending amount to use a debit/credit card, most shop owners will still let you use your card if you're out of cash and making a purchase. Not here. I was thirty cents below the minimum and had no other means of paying for my purchase and I did not want to add on another $3 item, so the cashier took my item back and I walked out the door. It just baffles me that they'd rather lose a sale/customer than let you use your card for a $2.20 purchase.In sum: hit or miss. Could be top notch with a few changes, in this reviewer's opinion.",

My boyfriend's salmon burger was pretty good, but served on bread and not a bun, which was kind of odd.  I also had the English Orange iced tea, which was refreshing and a little sweet without being cloying.Our waitress had a major stick up her ass, though, which is why I'm downgrading them a star.  Bread Co., why must you hire rude people?  More often than not, the people working here are gruff and disdainful of the customers.  I get it, you're too cool to smile.  I'm not asking for a hug at the end of the meal, all I'm looking for is service without a scowl.",

I had read many reviews of the restaurant and entered with some trepidation.  My party had a reservation for ten people at 6:00pm and I was in the last group to arrive - a little late. The other guests were already enjoying a drink while waiting. The service and food were both outstanding. Our server, Nick, was prompt, polite, and knowledgeable.  Everyone's food looked so good. I ordered a vegan pasta dish with vegetables, which was excellent.  My wife had one of the unique pizzas and enjoyed it thoroughly. I noticed that at the end of dinner all in our party had left nothing on their plates.  We were all full happy campers! Only one member ordered dessert - chocolate mousse. He said it was great.We were finished with a leisurely dinner and had our bill paid with more than enough time to stroll down the block to see our play. The only negatives were bread that was a bit burnt due to what appeared to be a hot spot in the oven and the meals which were delivered to the table one or two at a time, which seemed a bit odd. However, the overall experience was enjoyed by everyone, making for an excellent prelude to the play. I will definitely come here again.",

They're usually a soup and sandwich place during lunch, but for dinner they completely switch up their menu: filet mignon, duck breast, tapas, and fondue???  On CAMPUS??

Fondue is really the only reason to check this place out since I don't know of anything else nearby that has this for dessert, but food is just average. Oh and their sangria is on point, too.

There's a variety of sandwiches for the lunch hour, but I hit the Bread Company tonight, and my, do they swank it up for dinner.Dim lights, plentiful menu of pasta-pizza-sandwich options, and extensive specials list, including tapas.  Who knew?  I had the roast beef sandwich, served atop roasted potatoes and a light salad.

Even though we have had some issues with the service in the past, my family (pre-husband) has been coming here for as long as I can remember, probably over 10 years. The food is so good, there is really nothing the servers could do to keep us from coming back. My favorite meal in the world is the cheese fondue (sometimes with the tomato puree), one of the yummy pizzas (preferably with brie), followed by their chocolate fondue. (I think I have strayed from that formula once, I can't remember what I ordered)I didn't think it was possible, but last night, all three of those items were better than ever. We had the cheese fondue with the tomato puree this time, as well as the pesto, portobello mushrooms, artichoke hearts and brie pizza - it was amazing.The chocolate fondue came with more fruits than I remember in the past, red and green apples, pears, strawberries and some yummy little cake pieces. The best meal I had all year.The service was excellent.",

My husband and I usually share an order of cheese fondue and a gourmet pizza.  The Bread Company offers a nice selection of wine and beer, including wine by the carafe.  I can't forget to mention their selection of fresh baked cookies.  The sables and chocolate macaroons are delicious.  Great atmosphere, delicious food, and reasonable prices - I love this place!",

The Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, though, was aromatic and worth the extra charge (though it's reasonable to expect that the menu had listed the price or the waiter had known it after I asked: no luck on either).I waited much too long to place my order after sitting (and it was not busy).  But the prosciutto and gruyere omelet (which I added spinach to with no problem) that arrived vastly exceeded expectations: it was flavorful, chock full of good ingredients and not overcooked. The pan-fried potatoes were spiced but not overly salty (though I sent them back when they arrived with a huge dollop of unmentioned sour-cream--ew).The baked bread was sourdough and crusty and a perfect accompaniment. Nice job, Bread Company. Great food. Lacking final star only because my waiter could have used some some further training on the menu and service timing.",

Embarrassingly, I've heard some job candidates comment that they were taken here for 3 different meals during their visit!  My department is probably at fault for their lack of imagination when choosing restaurants, but The Bread Company offers some benefits that elevate it to a top pick for business-casual university diners:(1) Location.  For people who have short lunch periods and need to be within walking distance of campus, this restaurant's location is unbeatable.  (And since it's next door to an Espresso Royale, you can grab a coffee after your meal, if desired.)(2) Atmosphere.  Most college restaurants resemble a McDonald's Playroom for adolescents: neon walls and heavy-duty plastic furniture, with underlying scents of urine and vomit.  While The Bread Company does have a hint of grunge, it also invokes a strong sense of urban, artistic chic.  There are real paintings on the wall (not poster prints).  At night, they bring out white tablecloth and mood lighting.(3) Price.  I think the prices are reasonable depending on who you ask.  This place IS pricey when compared to most campus restaurants, where students are always trying to squeeze their dollars.  Lunch generally runs around $7 to $10, which is not unreasonable when entertaining guests.  (And still comparable/cheaper than what you can get at Timpone's, the other \"nice\" restaurant in the area.)All of the food is fairly conservative, with obvious combinations of flavors (brie + portobello, turkey + pesto, etc.).  I think this is also a reason that it ranks highly among options for guests; you will find nothing offensive here in terms of food (but also nothing exciting).  The presentation tends to be elegant and you can tell that most of the ingredients are of good quality.For lunch, I always go with the egg salad, which is creamy, well-seasoned, and always satiates my craving for egg goodness.  In the early evening, sometimes I stop by for a beer and appetizer with friends.  The cheese selection is quite good (you'll find Stilton, Gouda, Manchego, etc.), and the beers are all microbrews (if you're into that kind of thing).  Dinner selections include fondue, pastas, pizzas, and some specialties, but the prices are on par with more interesting restaurants in downtown Champaign/Urbana.In terms of baked goods, I am quite fond of ordering my sandwiches here with sourdough or rye bread.  Yum!  At most places with a baking reputation, I always find myself enticed by the sweet buns and cookies, but I almost never find myself tempted by the ones at The Bread Company.  Their treats always look colorless and hardened, as if they were made by an angry grandma.Overall, I'd recommend this to people who like simple, light food.  If you are cheap and don't care about indie street cred, you could probably get the same food at Panera.",

Horrible destination for dinner.The lines are long and the sandwiches are pretty decent at lunch time, and it's certainly worth a try if you've never been here before.I've been in twice for dinner and was very disappointed both times.  The first time I was here, the place was dead and there were maybe 2 other tables seated.  The other time was for Valentine's Day (stupid, I know), and the place was packed and seriously overbooked since they apparently had given reservations to everyone who called and asked for them.Both times, the service was very slow and the staff was *extremely* rude, to include elbowing and pushing customers during the crowded V-Day fiasco, which I found inexcusable.  The quality of the food was poor, the servings small, and the prices high.  There were definitely some interesting looking recipes on the menu, but the quality of the ingredients was very substandard so nothing tasted very good at all.  Produce is not fresh and all the fruits and vegetables I had on both occasions were over or under ripe and clearly prepackaged.  The first time I was in there, about 3 different entrees were ordered before we picked something they weren't out of.I only went back the second time for V-Day because I wanted to try out the chocolate fondue.  In addition to being waaaaaaaay overbooked, they were understaffed and had a limited V-Day menu that was basically just 6 or so items from the regular menu with the already high prices about doubled.  Portions were so unbelievably small that even after spending $75+ on dinner, we had to go to LaBamba's afterward because my husband was still really hungry.  Seriously, he was served a piece of lamb that was roughly the size of a sliver dollar and probably could've been eaten in one bite with a little effort.  Total time in restaurant was in the 3 hour range due to the poor service and inability to seat in accordance with reservations.  The chocolate fondue was served in a beat up saucepan that had something crusted all over the outside of it.  Chocolate itself was actually pretty good, but the amount of stuff they gave us to dip in it was staggeringly small and the vast majority of it consisted of bananas and apples that were overripe to the point they couldn't be eaten. Although it was fondue for two, there was only one piece each of the more high quality dipping items (cookie, strawberry, etc.)I will certianly not be back for dinner and probably not for lunch either since there are a variety of other lunch places in town that are just as good or better that are easier to get to, Paradiso in particular.",

A coworker and I went and the service was horrible (nothing new here - read the other comments - it must be their 'thing'!), price was absolutely atrocious for lunch and I ended up being sick all afternoon. I ordered the ham sandwich and my friend ordered their special salad of the day. Price was over $15. She got a diet coke, I was offered a shot glass of water with no ice. We get to the cashier and she refuses to listen to me as I try to tell her what our order was. I asked the gentleman who took our order to put it on one ticket as it was my turn to pay, and he didn't. So, she proceeds to ring me up, and then not give us the drink. So, I tell her, we need the diet coke. She flips back through the register tape and says, \"Oh, I overcharged you a little. Oh well. I'll go get the drink.\" NEVER offered me a refund or to make it correct. Then, gives me a picture to put on our table so she can bring us our items, but then said, \"Oh, nevermind, they are both ready.\" So, I'm standing there with a drink, my wallet and looking at two plates. I said, \"I can't carry all this.\" she says, \"You can take a tray\" and points to the cafeteria trays on the counter. I opted to deliver my friends salad to her (as she had secured us a table) and drink, and then came back for my sandwich. I ordered a ham sandwich. I got a turkey sandwich. And then, I got sick......I will NEVER return. I don't need to pay over fifteen dollars for a salad and drink and sandwich and be treated like shit only to then be sick all afternoon.",

If you think that the reason why they are selling out of different entrees at dinner is because of poor planning, it is obvious that you have never worked in the restaurant industry.  Dishes sell out at the Bread Company because they are popular...duh!  There is no way to predict what will sell what night, and if you are upset that dishes are out of stock, you should be showing up earlier to insure that they still have their full night's supply.  As for the service being poor, it's true: the servers are mostly college kids that could give two shakes about their job, but the food is so incredible, it just doesn't matter to me.  The head chef, Daniel is honest to God a pure genius when it comes to creating new dishes and I never order off of anything but the specials menu.  Trust me when I say trust Dan with your dinner.  If he has a hand in creating it it's bound to be amazing.",

It's such a shame because their food is not bad, but the service is so badly below standard, I decided I am simply never coming back here.There is one particular worker with tattoos on his arm who is very insolent towards customers, raising his voice at them for asking questions.For months, I've ordered a grilled sandwich to pick up for lunch time, and the result is totally random. If the owner (tall bald guy) is there when you call, chances are you'll get a good sandwich with the potatoes and salad on the side, but if he's not there, watch out: there's no telling what you'll get. Sometimes they include potatoes and salad with the sandwich, sometimes they don't. Sometimes they slice the sandwich, sometimes they don't. Sometimes the sandwich is available since the grill is on, and other times it's not even available since they turn off the grill in the middle of the day to save money randomly.Today for example, I went to pick up my grilled sandwich to-go, and was surprised to see that on this occasion there were no potatoes and salad included, even though two weeks ago I ordered around the same time and they were included. So I asked the short-haired lady in front of me behind the register, \"are there potatoes and salad?\" (pointing at the sandwich) and she stared directly at my eyes without answering! So I repeated the question and she stood there completely quiet, staring at me without answering, when the tattooed arm punk butted in our conversation, cocked his head at me and yelled, \"didn't we go over this already?!\" Don't bother coming here. Unless the owner fires some of the incompetent and insolent flunkies buzzing behind the counter soon, this place needs to go out of business ASAP.",

They have vegetarian options, that are okay, more diverse than many places, but the few times I've been there, the salads needed a little work.  It is a-ok to tear the lettuce up a bit so people don't have to slobber it all over their faces.  I really hate a clunky salad.  The pear panini was satisfying and but the IKEA tables outside make me nostalgic for my own yard and my own cooking, thus reinforcing my tagline \"Vegetarian with a touch of snobbery\"I don't rate restaurants on their administrative prowess, but if I did I wouldn't give any to the TBC.  The waitstaff and management made it nearly impossible to process a reimbursement through the University of Illinois.  You would think, given their proximity to campus, that they would train people adequately with respect to how to handle the idiosyncrasies of receipt processing through the University.  Instead, I am wasting my work and personal time chasing down the original receipt for a charge entered incorrectly by a waitress.  And the day manager can't help me?  Um... I just recommend not going here at all if there is a chance you will need to then make your lifework sleuthing receipts.  Oh how fulfilling.   I've heard other people say that it is always a nightmare to expense TBC meals.   The U of I-area restaurants need to take a page from the book of vendors in other college towns and get their act together.",

The house-made mint iced tea and mulled wine were also very good.The food was interesting and delicious, and our waitress Joanna was awesome. She was friendly, answered all of our questions, and checked in just often enough to make sure we had what we needed without being overbearing.

My favorite is the cheese (gruyere) croissant because it is so flaky. It literally melts in my mouth. My coworker called it high class junk food but I call this good stuff. Sometimes, when I felt lazy to go to lunch, I would just buy a loaf of bread and eat that with a cup of coffee. The zufte or zoft, which is a Swiss specialty bread is amazing. It is fresh and out of the oven by 11am during school days. I have not seen other places in the area that sell zufte but the bread is really worth trying. Oh, if you have cravings for day old bread, they sell them at half price.They also have a wonderful selection for dinner. Daily specials change quite often but they have their regular dinner menu. I usually go with the daily special. This place also has fondue, both cheese and chocolate. I had both and I have to say that they are pretty stingy with their cheese and chocolate. I had barely enough to cover the fruit or bread. Do expect $12-$17 for entrees and about $10 for fondue. By the way, they sell cheeses too in the day.They have pretty good service but the people do not seem to smile a lot during the day, especially the owner. They should be happy because of the wonderful smell of fresh bread. The decor is a little European and has a fireplace at the corner which makes the place extra cozy in the evening. Anyhows, this place is highly recommended. I am sure you'll love it.",

Ten bucks without tip for this sub-MacDonald concoction. Overworked, insufficient in numbers student workers who do little in terms of service but hope for a tip nevertheless.

I lived in Germany for a while, so european style bakeries are even more happy.The first time I came to TBC, it was around 11am on a Tuesday and I wanted a quiet place to study. I wanted to get a small zupfe roll because they were fresh out of the oven and a cup of coffee, but that didn't cost $5 and I didn't have any cash (there is a $5 card minimum). I wound up getting an americano, a whole zupfe loaf, and a cookie. The zupfe was delicious. Hot from the oven, braided, yeasty, and slightly sweet. I pulled it apart and ate 1/3 of it right there. The cookie was pretty greasy. The americano was fine.The second time I came it was after a big exam and I wanted a glass of wine. At 11:30am. TBC was happy to oblige. My two friends ordered the portabella sandwich, which I had a bite of and I have to say it was delicious! Marinated chopped portabella mushrooms, melted cheese, some kind of sweet fruit spread. I wish I'd ordered it! I had a glass of riesling (which was fairly expensive for the quality) and a bowl of chicken noodle soup. I was hoping for a nice homemade soup with fat noodles and pieces of chicken, but what I got was a crock of bright yellow soup that I know came from a Mrs. Grass box. I will continue to come and try more of TBC's offerings, but definitely not the soups...",

They very much resemble the style we've had in Rome: very thin, crisp crust, light on the creative toppings. The portobello, artichoke, roasted peppers and fontina one was especially memorable.  Service was very good - prompt, friendly and quick.  Our waitresses were very pleasant.  The prices may seem a little high, so if you want a cheap thick crust gloppy stuffed pizza, go elsewhere.",

                "review": "Restaurant reviewAfter 1 year of living in Champaign, I finally had a chance to come to this restaurant recommended my a previous coworker. The reviews on Yelp are quite mix and it appears that lunch is good, but dinner is so so. Since I have not found another restaurant that has chocolate fondue here in Central IL, we decided to come here for dinner. I will say that I really wanted to like this restaurant, but overall value is a 2 star, the option for fondue brings it up to a 2.5. It is located right on campus and I never even knew about this restaurant when I lived nearby. The ambiance is very eclectic, lots of wall decorations and a European cafe feel. The multiple non-matching chairs throughout the dining room maybe a \"modern\" design, but I felt it was very \"chintzy\". I thought about going with the filet or fish entree, but the other reviews made me a little concern so I went with a safe dish (Shrimp fettuccine) with a light tomato basil cream sauce. It took a bit of time for the dish to come out. Meanwhile, we were given complimentary french bread. Given the name of the restaurant I was a bit disappointed that the bread was not a soft piping hot bread from the oven. Well I digress, back to the entree, it really wasn't anything special. My wife's quote on her salmon salad and the pasta was, \"It taste like food you can make at home\". The portions sizes were also smaller than expected when you order pasta at a restaurant. I was hoping that the chocolate fondue would be the redeeming value of the meal. Unfortunately this was not the case. Typically you would expect strawberries and maybe even a rice crispy treat to dip in the chocolate. Don't get me wrong the dark chocolate was amazing, but they gave a plate of pears, green and red apples, and some sort of cake that crumbled when you poked at it too hard with the fondue fork. Service is hit or miss, our server came by a few times and made sure our cups of water were filled. This maybe a great place for date night on campus or maybe for sandwiches at lunch, but my dinner experience was so so.Pros: Cheese and chocolate fondue, I have yet to find another place that has this option. Great for date night with wine, cheese, bread etc. Cons: Expensive based on what you get, small portion size, no hot fresh bread from the bread company for dinner, where are the strawberries, marshmallow, or rice krispy treats with the chocolate fondue? I think if they tried they could make this a stellar restaurant here in CU.Hidden deals: Daily drink and food specials on the chalk boardHealth code rating: A. http://champaign.il.gegov.com/champaign/estab.cfm?facilityID=2000",

I have a bunch of stories about this, but here's the two that contrast most significantly: (1) When I came for afternoon drinks with my writing group, it was quiet and we received great, not-too-hands-on service: a nice mixture of noticing when we might want more drinks and letting us alone.(2) A few weeks ago, my husband and I went with a party of 6 for dinner 1 1/2 hours before a show, told them our schedule, and were assured that we should have plenty of time. Cool -- except that the whole thing turned out to be kind of a disaster. We all ordered at the same time, and there seemed to be plenty of servers for a full room at dinner, but our meals arrived over the course of a half-hour (the pasta came after the steak, hmm). Fresh and tasty dinners, yes, but it was impossible to wait and eat together, and everyone was antsy due to the delays. In the end, we finished 20 minutes after our preferred time and our waitress did not seem particularly motivated to help the situation along or even really apologize.So: Good food, decent wine, but the service is a gamble. Try it, but go on a quiet weeknight -- definitely not for a Krannert opening or right before another occasion.",

Sandwiches are on luscious slices of thick bread and the soups come with crunchy salads. I especially like the grilled sandwiches, which are laced with creamy butter and lightly browned meat. Portions are quite large and one sandwich could probably be shared easily among two adults. Sometimes I forget this and end up making two meals out of one sandwich.During lunch hours this place is quite crowded, but by late afternoon it becomes serene. Soft green light floods in from the skylight and during the winter you can sit the fire with a baguette and a glass of wine.  As regards to the review that mentioned rudeness about adding protein to things, I've heard that happen many times during lunch and now they let you have your meat, but charge a lot for it. They have this bizarre policy because they \"don't want people making their own sandwiches with the bread that comes with the entree.\" Nice one. At night it becomes more formal, with candlelight, fondue, and more upscale entrees. The balsamic potatoes that come with the entrees are perfect. I like the fondue, but it's a little too much for me...even the small pot can be shared by two. Last time I was there I tried the tapas and the yellowfin tuna and the lamb were delicious, but I was less than enthusiastic about the duck mousse, which had a bland sickly sweet flavor. The greens that came with the tapas were also pretty inexcusable. When I go to a good restaurant I expect more than just some shredded romaine, especially when field greens are still in season. The new small desserts are also not so great. The chocolate mousse was good, but the bread pudding was just some bread soaked in eggs and sugar.",

The sandwiches may be $1-2 more but are killer compared to other on-campus options.  The grilled sandwiches may be a little buttery on the crust for some, but it's perfect for me.  Last time that I went I got the grilled turkey sandwich which comes with caramelized onions and cheese.Dinner options include fondue and pretty good pizza.  They also have some good bottles of wine on the list, I've ordered a bottle twice and been happy with what I got.  You might have to talk to one of the chefs if you want wine opinions since our server didn't seem to know much.Really good atmosphere and decor, it's casual/fancy enough for pretty much anything, and it's right next to Krannert if you need an after-show dinner.",

                "review": "My husband and I, along with two other couples, decided to celebrate the end of the semester tonight by going out.  After *much* debate, we ended up at The Bread Company.  As a former music major, this was one of my usual haunts, but the rest of them hadn' t been there quite as frequently.  (Lunch, by the way, is excellent; they have excellent sandwiches and salads).The specialty, of course, is the fondue, which is magnifique.  My only gripe is that portion sizes tend to vary widely from time to time, as does the selection of vegetables that comes with your meal.  The combination of cheeses, though, is great, and the bread and potatoes are wonderful.Tonight, though, I had one of their specials, which was good, but was actually my *third* choice of menu items.  They were out of the fettucine with salmon AND out of the chicken pizza.  Now, I don't pretend to understand the inner workings of the restaurant business, but it really irritates me when they run out of something.  To me, that just smacks of poor planning.  Do they not have a kitchen?  Can they not make more?  If not, then can they not provide accurate estimates of how much of each food item to make, so they won't run out?  I don't know, but it just seems like when you go someplace, you should be able to look at the menu with confidence.Anyway, the beef fondue I had was very good, and one of my dinner companions adored her trout.  She said it was the most moist fish she had eaten in quite some time, and she is a fish lover.  Her husband, a reasonably picky eater, devoured his pancetta pizza with no complaints, as did another friend with his salmon.  I thought the portion sizes of some of the meals were pretty small, especially given the price.  Still, it's good food, and worth the money, especially when you consider it's not that expensive.  Service was pretty good, although a little slow, particularly since they weren't that busy tonight.  My guess is she just had a hard day.We love the Bread Company and will continue to visit, but probably just for the fondue.  We know they'll have it, and we know it's good.  Thanks for a fun evening!",

                "review": "Our family dined here after my sister's graduation. It was nice of them to move our reservation up on such short notice but after eating here, I understood why this wasn't a problem.If you're called \"The Bread Company\" you probably shouldn't serve burnt bread. The crust of our Italian bread was burnt. Though the bread was good otherwise, leaving a charred taste in your patrons' mouths is not the best way to start a meal.When my sister made the reservation they did not inform her that there wouldn't be a full menu that day. So though we looked at the menu online beforehand, we were only able to order from their limited graduation-day menu.There were seven of us and we ordered vegetarian dishes. Three of us had the grilled portobello sandwich with raspberry aioli and brie ($10), which was served with a side of salad greens and roasted potatoes. The presentation and portion-size were perfect. The mushrooms were fresh and juicy and the raspberry aioli went well with the brie. Those who ordered this plate seemed satsified.The other four of us split two pizzas: the roasted garlic with san marzano tomato sauce and Parmesan ($12), and the pesto with portabella, artichoke hearts and brie ($15). The reason we split them? Our waitress said they were 10 inch pizzas. They were actually smaller, about 6-7 inches in diameter. Now I usually love a cracker-thin crust, but ours was burnt in places. The roasted garlic pizza was at best a decent cheese pizza and the pesto with portabella and artichoke hearts did not benefit from the addition of brie; though it added texture, the brie did little to compliment the flavors of the other ingredients on the pizza. Overall the ingredients seemed fresh, but I've had much better thin crust pizza for less money, and more of it too. Though the restaurant seemed full, the same people were dining the whole time we were there. Only one party arrived while we were dining. It's a small place and there only seemed to be a server or two but seeing as it wasn't really busy, you'd think service would be more attentive. Our waitress was not. She was pleasant. She refilled our waters once and brought another basket of (still burnt) bread upon request. We were not asked if we wanted drinks or dessert. And we waited for our check for about twenty minutes. Turns out she went on lunch and took our check with her. We didn't gyp her on the tip at all--seeing as it's a college-town and they were probably short-staffed on graduation weekend, and we weren't running late for anything--but we certainly won't be dining here again. Side note: they do not accept Discover.Taking everything into consideration, I'd give this place a C+. I'm sure there are better white-cloth restaurants in Champaign-Urbana and you'd be better off eating there.",

I am less into fondue (exceot for chocolate dessert fondue), but this is the place to go for that.  The ambiance is eclectic and European.  Families will feel welcome.  Service can be a little ragged, sometimes a student group of 15 or large party will materialize, and that can have a rather deleterious effect on service when there are only 2 servers on the floor, which is often the case at night.

The only reason I continue to go back has got to be because I forget about how sub-standard their food is. And today I decided to finally put my disappointment on the internet.This review was spurred by a visit today to get coffee and a pastry. I ordered an americano that was obviously made with poor quality espresso, and perhaps by someone with little knowledge of what an americano should be. It was too watery, but maybe that is my taste. I also had what they dared to call a chocolate croissant. It could have been made days ago. Instead of being light and fluffy, it was dense and doughy and filled with chocolate chips that were never fully melted so they maintained their chip structure. I was less than impressed. But this seems to be the way things go at the Bread Company.As I mentioned earlier, I have been going to the Bread Company for quite a few years (having been at the U of I as a student since 2008), and their menu has yet to change. At all. This sort of stagnancy is worrisome and really speaks to the lack of effort that the chef and/or owner put into this business.On a recent dinner visit I got the chocolate fondue which came with possibly pre-made cinnamon bread slices, strawberries, and a plethora of apples and pears. I suppose the apples and pears were in season (it was November when I went), but I don't see how apples work with chocolate. I've had their pizza many times, and I cannot deny that they do a good crust...but I just don't get the pizza that comes with a mountain of salad on top. It is just too much and overwhelms the pizza that really should be the star of the dish.Overall the Bread Company is uninspired and very tired. This is reflected in their dusty, unchanging interior, their menus, and the often impolite, lackluster performances of the staff.",

Just about anything else I've had there, including their soups, was just bland and cost waaaaay more than it should.

At the time you could get a very decent swiss cheese fondue with good bread, some roasted garlic for an appetizer, and two glasses of house red for just over $30--a princely sum for a starving college student, but compared with the trendy $100 fondue restaurants in the SF Bay Area, a steal. The dinnertime atmosphere was also great: quiet, romantic, dimly but warmly lit.They also had fantastic checkerboard shortbread cookies. I've been hard pressed to find better anywhere else.Lunch sandwiches and other baked goods were both decent, but the five stars are for the fondue date memories.",

I mean, if the place is called \"Bread Company\" I expect the bread to be something special, you know what I mean?

It was, by far, the worst restaurant service I have ever experienced. It was a shame because the restaurant has such great potential because the food was great...but the service was so bad that I never want to come ever again. The waitress I had was unfriendly. It was really weird -- it didn't even seem like she was attempting to be nice. Also, I spent 2x the amount of time I should have been there waiting for my bill and for the waitress to take my order. Basically, if you have a lot of time on your hands and you don't mind awful service, this is a great place to get food. However, if you have any standards for customer service, don't bother.",

I really wish I could discuss the food, but the service is so bad that I can't remember what I had to eat.  In case the staff reads yelp in between listening to the Smiths all day and wondering why they aren't famous artists yet, here are some tips:1.  Bring menus for everyone2.  Do not walk away if only three people have ordered and there are four people at the table.3. Do not roll your eyes, kid. 4. Do not pretend that you are a really good waitress who can remember everything.  You have to write it down because when you don't write it down you will end up bringing me the wrong thing.  5.  Do not forget to take empty plates off the rickety, unclean table because otherwise there is nowhere to put down the food. It's ok the first time you bring it because the order is wrong and you have to take it back.  (See number 3) 6.  Do not let our wine glasses get empty. We live in the midwest too. We hate it here too. We need more wine.",

First of all, the atmosphere is incredible. I've spent a lot of my life in Europe, and the way this place looks reminds me of little mom-and-pap restaurants one would find in the Mediterranean. This feeling is especially strong in the terrace in the back; stepping into that room feels like stepping into Spain. It's a bizarre, nostalgic experience for me, and one that hasn't happened quite as strongly anywhere else in the United States. The lunch is incredible. I like to think of myself as a bit of a sandwich connoisseur (hold your laughter), and the grilled sandwiches here are amazing. The dinner, unfortunately, isn't up to par with their lunch service. The only dish fresh enough in my memory to comment on is the shrimp linguine, which was a little bland. I haven't been able to try the fondue yet, which seems to be the go-to dish here, so I'll be trying that next time I go.Service is lovely, and their handmade drinks are very good too. Strongly recommended.",

They sure knew how to accommodate a large group of 14 year old girls on my birthday years ago!Recommendations-Roast beef sandwich-Portabella, brie, and raspberry jam sandwich-Zpfe bread, it's comparable to challah bread.-Cheese fondue - beautiful beautiful gruyere fondue. As good as Switzerland-Meat fondue - the broth is lovely, it's served with three different sauces and fresh baguette.-Chocolate fondue - Melted swiss chocolate, fresh fruit in season, cookies, pound cake.I love this place.

Sometimes I went for the half soup/half sandwich, or half salad/half sandwich to get more variety in my diet. The food here is like comfort food for me, since I grew up in Urbana and my mother used to buy these sandwiches and their large loaves of freshly baked Zpfe for my brothers and me. The service at The Bread Company has always been fast and efficient, and the employees were always very cool and made no mistakes taking my order and making me a really good sandwich. I've been here a few times for dinner with my friends. The atmosphere totally changes in the evening for dinner, as they lay out white tablecloths, dim the lights and allow the romantic glow of candles set the mood. Their pizza is delicious and filling, and their tapas come in pretty big portions. This is a cute and cozy place for anyone on a date or double date, or out to celebrate a special occasion.I've ordered take out from them a few times when I've had last minute dinner party pot lucks to attend and didn't have time to cook. One time, I picked up a strawberry walnut mixed green salad, which was perfect, and also a french baguette with a side of baked garlic bulbs drizzled with olive oil. It was worth every dollar.I love this place!",

Now, I wasn't a huge fan of ham, and I truly hated swiss, and about all he knew was that I liked mustard (so he included it), but... being that we were so new together, I ate that sandwich like it was a long lost favorite.And shocking... instead of having to choke it down... I loved the thing!  Later in life, when I explained to him how much I hated ham and swiss sandwiches, I told him how amazed I was at how much I loved the one he'd been getting me from The Bread Company!!  Their ingredients, I mean!  Talk about fresh (I hate to sound like a commercial, but!  When it's true, it's true!!) The sprouts were genius, and the swiss was like none I'd ever had.  Ever!  Emmentaler. I mean, this place was no joke SMART about how it crafted food!  And there was no denying that rye!  The crown jewel of the whole thing!  Crunchy exterior, soft in all the right places, with a kick-yer-butt mustard... just out of this world spectacular.The whole thing became our ritual.  I'd come into town from Bloomy and we'd head over to Bread Company.  He'd get a loaf, hot out of the oven, of Challa, and I'd get my ham and cheese sandwich and we'd head back to his dorm.  Such bitter sweet memories.  And all over a sandwich!Trust me, this place makes some of the best fresh bread (I mean... HOT FROM THE OVEN GOOD), and some of the greatest food on campus.  They do more than sandwiches... OMG, go one night for the fondu!  It's an amazing experience!!  Whatever it is, find something you love and make it a memory to share.",

                "review": "Mirsung is given representation mostly as a grocery store (at least according to its listing on Yelp), but several months ago, it annexed a modest, \"fast food\" cafe next door to the grocery.  Frankly, the purpose of my visits have been to pick up prepared lunches, not groceries, so I can't really comment on the latter.Like other Indian restaurants in town (except for the Bombay Grill on First Street), this place is mostly a greasy lunch counter for college kids.  There are a few tables for anyone who wants to eat there, and while the space is brightly-lit by large shopfront windows, the decorations are sparse and uninspiring.However, don't be deterred by general criticisms on the restaurant's interior.  Mirsung probably has the best deal on Indian food in Champaign.  When you walk up to the front counter, you'll see a food-laden hot bar, along with a white-board listing the daily menu and prices.  If you're not familiar with Indian food, this might be a good way to try it out, as you can just pick out dishes that are visually appealing to you.  Each day, Mirsung serves 2 vegetarian entrees, 2 meat entrees, a special rice dish, soup, appetizers (including samosas), and DOSAS!  The combination meals are around $7 to $9 (depending on whether you order meat or vegetable entrees), which is quite reasonable as your take-out containers will be bulking with food when you leave.  Most of the food you receive will be rice, a contentious point for most diners (who prefer more meat for their money), but given the spiciness and richness of many Indian dishes, I usually like having more rice.  If this is indeed an issue for you, I would recommend ordering the daily special rice instead of plain basmati rice, which costs $1 more per combo plate, but can easily serve as a meal by itself.I've had good experiences with the special rice dishes, including the lemon rice, tamarind rice, and chicken biryani.  These rice dishes are flavored generously with spices, mustard seeds, and fresh curry leaves.  I like the sauces on most of the entrees, including the chicken tikka masala, chicken vindaloo, and okra masala.  The only real complaint I have regarding food is that the paneer has been a bit tough when I've had it in the past.Mirsung is located a pleasant distance from the busiest part of Green Street, which means: (1) free parking is available, and (2) you won't feel that you're trapped in some hellish war between pedestrians and traffic.  Students shouldn't be discouraged from stopping by, though, as it is still an easy walk from the campus neighborhoods on First Street.",

                "review": "AVOID THIS PLACE!!!!!I've been here twice in the past week and maybe once before that, about a year ago... they have dosas.  I LOVE dosas.   And maybe just the fact that they have dosas made me delusional.   I came here earlier in the week and ordered the spicy masala dosa.   It came out in all it's golden brown crepe-like goodness, served with mint (?) chutney and lentil soup.   I tore into it and boy was it good.  I was eating bits of the crepe and dipping it in both the chutney and the soup.   It had a bit of a kick to it!  Then I realized that I wasn't getting any \"masala\" part.  I opened it and there was maybe two tablespoons worth of filling.  Red flags should've been going up, but I just kept eating and dipping.  I was satisfied. I figured that since there was so little filling, I was keeping my calorie count down for the day! Bonus for me!!!  It cost about $9 for the dosa. I returned two nights later to pick up some takeout for dinner.  I ordered the chicken tikka masala with rice AND naan.   During the day, they have a hot bar/buffet going on which runs from 11 - 2:30.  (When I went in earlier in the week -- I came in at noon and the buffet STILL wasn't ready -- by the time I left at 12:30 -- it still wasn't there so who knows when it starts) I came in around 4pm.... the hot bar/buffet hadn't been cleaned up and there were bins with the dredges (hardened and dried and OLD food that are left at the bottom).   I kind of look grossed out by what was left and the man (cook? waiter?) assured me there was food in the back.  After I ordered, he went into the kitchen and came back out with a plastic container of rice (which looked as if it was microwaved -- there were bubbles of moisture on the inside of the plastic... if it was fresh, there would've just been cloudy steam.... these were water droplets already!!) and some naan wrapped in foil.   Then he took a takeout box and went to the hot bar and stirred up one of the containers (it was red and there was an oily lake of grease lying on top of it) and started to spoon it into a container.   I was in shock that I couldn't speak.   He remembered that I also ordered a mango lassi --- he went over to the sliding door fridge and pulled out a pre-made lassi that for all I knew, had been made yesterday!   Anyway, it was $10 and all I could think was, \"This can't be good, this can't be good.\" Picked up my son from school, went home and we sat down at the table.   I unwrapped the naan and there was a huge hole in the middle (it wasn't a rip... it was a HOLE as if somebody had eaten it from the middle!! Plus it was hard as a rock) and as I put the first bite of tikka masala in my mouth, I pulled out stems from some unknown herb..... needless to say, I couldn't/didn't even want to feed it to my son.   I wound up throwing everything down the garbage disposal and warmed up last night's leftovers of rice, shake&bake chicken and heated up some corn.    Nasty --- will NEVER EVER go back .... and even if ChampaignTaste gave it a good review.",

The best deal is the buffet however, for which you can try everything (except Dosas) for $9.99. I saw another table get two of those and it was a HUGE amount of food. If you like AUTHENTIC Indian food and a clean but no frills dining experience, this is an excellent choice. The other great thing: they deliver for both breakfast and lunch.",

We came up to read the menu and I found the woman at the register to be a pushy sales person. When we finally decided on a pizza and were getting ready to pay, she interjects a comment about how we should leave a tip for the baker. How rude to insist that we tip? Doesn't the baker make a full wage? He's no waitress after all. We probably would have tipped anyway but it felt strange to be pressured like that. Also, I'm almost positive that they're grossly abusing the term \"local\" because it's trendy. The peppers were all listed as locally grown...then it occurred to me, it's April in central illinois, what kind of crazy magician is able to grow bell peppers right now?? News Flash: no perversion of the english language could allow for California, Mexico, or Florida to be considered local to central illinois! I would have even accepted \"regional\" but local? No way. In the end, the pizza was okay, just okay.",

It sounds scary, but was very good (and not too spicy).I'm also fascinated that they managed to install a wood-fired brick oven on a food truck.  Such a neat idea, and they executed it well.  With pizza, you worry about how long it will take to get an order out, but they can pump out pizzas quickly.  We used them for a kids party, and they were able to turn out 50+ pizzas in under an hour.  It was incredible.  We'd use them again in a heartbeat for a party.  They were very accommodating.  It was nice to have the guests get whatever they wanted without worrying about appeasing everyone with my topping choices.The ingredients are quite good too.  The Neapolitan style dough is thin and crispy and delicious.  You may want to ask them to leave it in the oven a bit longer if you want it crispier.",

So I decided to give it a try. They have seven specialty pizzas that already have toppings picked out. There is also the option of creating your own pizza. I ordered the Margherita pizza and a Red Dragon pizza. While I was waiting for the pizzas to come out of the oven, I asked the workers about how they make the pizzas and what was unique about them. They make the pizzas \"neopoliton\" style which refers to the way Italians make their pizza. The dough is hand-tossed and the pizza is baked in a ceramic oven. The workers were really friendly and helpful in choosing a pizza that I would like. We took the pizza home, which was about 15 minutes away. The pizza was still warm, but not as warm as it would have been when coming out of the oven. In my experience, I would take my pizza and eat it as soon as it was ready. Dragon Fire pizzas are not like regular American pizza's because the crust isn't seasoned and there isn't an overload of cheese. It is an acquired taste that I would recommend delving into.",

But that's exactly what Dragon Fire Pizza is. And their pizza is amazing.I'd never heard of Neapolitan-style pizza--I'm usually a deep-dish fan myself--but this pizza is seriously fantastic. Really, really tasty, with lots of flavor options, and a crunchy-chewy-slightly-toasty crust that's something special. Plus, the people are really friendly and you can tell they earnestly want you to have the best experience possible. I've visited their truck a number of times, and I always come away happy.Also, they're big on supporting the community--and great with kids! We invited them to my son's cub scout troop and they very handily taught a bunch of rowdy kids how to stretch their own pizza dough and make their own pizzas. It was unforgettable--the kids AND the parents enjoyed it a lot.When you see them out and about--and they're hard to miss!--do yourself a favor and check 'em out!",

I like spicy food and I was pleased with their self-named \"Dragon Fire\". Spicy isn't the only thing they do though. The Red Dragon is probably my second favorite.I'm not a vegetarian, but I was impressed with the large number of vegetarian pizza choices they have. And for the non-vegetarians out there, with most of them you don't even know you're eating something without meat.Probably the best aspect of their pizzas is the dough. It's very chewy, but not undercooked. It kind of reminded me of a warm flat-bread (like the kind you would use for a gyro) but thinner and warm. It folds easily so it's not droopy.Probably the best advice I can give would be for you to bookmark the \"Finder\" page on their website. They keep a current calendar and Twitter feed on there so you'll always know where they are.",

I got a Gold Dragon and it was amazing. I went to Italy and I feel like a crust snob. It needs to be crunchy and chewy at the same time for me to really love it. Dragon Fire Pizza nailed it. (Yeah for you!)  The pizza size is just enough to look like you can't eat it all, but then somehow you magically can. Boom! It's just gone. So needless to say, I ate the whole thing myself. It was hot, it was fresh, it was flavorful and it was pizza. Do I really need to say more? Like the owner said \"What American doesn't like pizza\"Just go. And don't plan to share.",

I tried one of their weekly specials (BBQ chicken pizza) last week and I did not care for it as much (and it was much more expensive).  They offer it on cardboard rounds if you are eating immediately, or in a box if you are taking it to go.  They also offer a ghost pepper cheese add-on to the Dragon Fire that I have not been brave enough to try yet, but I've heard that is good as well.  Very friendly staff, and it's freshly made pizza brick-oven pizza in just a few minutes.",

My husband took the Dragon Fire pizza challenge--it is spicy to the max.I have also gotten a custom veggie pizza with spinach, peppers, and onion, and was very pleased. Even though the crust is thin, it holds up well with multiple toppings. I like folding the slices in half, NYC style, to get all the good stuff in one bite.Courteous, fast, professional, and tasty pizza to go for $10? Yes, please.",

But this review is based on more recent visits. :-)It can get busy on Sundays after churches typically get out. But, for the most part, there is not a long wait. One one recent occasion I had brunch with my mom and a family friend. I ordered a salad. It was HUGE. I actually had to take half of it to go! On the second recent trip, we went out as a family for Mother's Day. No wait late in the afternoon. I ordered the banana blueberry pancakes. They were supposed to be multigrain, but learned that they had discontinued the multigrain batter the week before. :-(  But the waitress said that they could make them with regular batter. I was surprosed that the bananas were not baked in the pancake, rather they were sliced on top. Regardless, the pancakes were still good. They have sugar free syrup if that is your preference and it wasn't bad. They let me alter my order no problem. It was supposed to come with turkey sausage and egg whites. But I changed it to fruit and bacon. No extra charge.Speed of service and attentiveness dependent upon who you get and the time of day. But I haven't had a negative experience. Pay your tab at the front register, not at the table.",

The lady that rung me up was so friendly and reassured me the pie would be great. It turns out we had a hit item at the picnic we went to. Everyone kept talking about the pie as we were making our way through the savory main dishes. And boy did it disappear fast. The pie was just as delicious as Marie's.

They serve \"mammoth muffins\" for around $2.30.  They had the typical kinds like Banana Nut, but also Cranberry Nut and Carrot, which I really wanted to try but I couldn't imagine that cream cheese frosting sitting too well at 8am.  Another time.Their muffins are big... I guess \"mammoth\" sized, but instead of an insanely gigantic muffin all I can picture is an adorable woolly mammoth.  Anyways, I thought the muffin was cream-filled, but it came with a mini scoop of butter on the side.  Not the same, and I didn't slab it on.  It tasted great the way it was.  With a cup of coffee my breakfast was within $5.By the way their pies and cookies are amazing, especially their FRENCH SILK pie.  All I've had here are their desserts and that is fine by me!",

Not downright bad, definitely not particularly good.I got an omelet with pepper jack cheese and the \"garden mix\" (green peppers, onions, and celery).  It came with homefries and 3 pancakes.  All for just under $9.  Not a bad price considering the ridiculous amount of food you get, but I don't really NEED that much food, and it wasn't very good food.The pancakes were pretty good; I had them with the wild berry sauce, since I can't stand that fake \"maple\" syrup that restaurants serve--so kudos to them for offering 3 different syrup choices for pancakes (maple syrup, wild berry syrup, and peach syrup).  The hashbrowns were also decent.  My omelet was pretty nasty and I ended up just eating half of it.  The pepper jack cheese tasted cheap and bland and the peppers onions and celery (....still a bit baffled by the inclusion of celery) was just not a great combo.  Kind of annoyed that cheese counts toward one of the \"free\" toppings in the \"create your own omelet\"...shouldn't an omelet just...COME with cheese?I had a few sips of my boyfriend's coffee and it tasted pretty good.Service was average, and we got our food fairly quickly.The bill for the 2 of us came to about $22 (before tip).  We spent a couple bucks less at Courier Cafe last weekend, for better food and a more interesting atmosphere.  Definitely will be going back to Courier Cafe, not so sure about Perkins.",

The food was good and hit the spot. The problems came after we got our food. Our waitress disappeared. I'm not sure if she was taking a break or busy doing other tasks but she was nowhere to be found. We were wanting to order dessert which is one of the perks of going to Perkins as they have good pie and other goodies. Unfortunately we have had this type of service in the past. We did inform the manager about our disappearing waitress.Another problem I have with the staff is that if you order a muffin with your meal, don't expect to get dessert. The waiter/waitress will suggest that you 'probably don't want dessert' since you had a muffin. This has happened to us on multiple visits from multiple waitresses. I'm not sure if this is how they train their staff here, but it's really not a good way to run a business. I want to give them my money for more food and tip well, but they make it very difficult to do this.I don't care if you have the best food on the planet. If your service is lousy, then it ruins the whole experience.",

I've experienced better\" and three stars jumps to \"A-OK.\"  Perkins is somewhere in between.  The menu for breakfast seems pretty extensive.  I ordered a platter that included smoked sausage (greasy), sausage (greasy and bland), eggs (done okay), bacon (spot on), breakfast potatoes (pretty good), and pancakes (so-so).  I like that they leave a pot of coffee on the table, rather than having you wait for refills from the wait staff.  It would have been even better if the pot was full and the coffee was good, neither of which was the case.  My waitress was efficient and personable.  Seemed more like a pro waitress rather than some of these student types that serve with the attitude that says, \"I'm only doing this until I graduate and start my money-making career, so don't expect much.\"  Again, not all student wait staff are like that but some are.  The place seemed clean and it wasn't very busy for a Saturday morning breakfast.  I've wanted to try Perkins and must admit i went there today only because Courier Cafe was closed.  I will return to Perkins, as there were some other things on the menu I'd like to try and because the experience wasn't completely a bust.  Although, I am usually a member of the Clean Plate Club, I did leave behind one piece of smoked sausage, a sausage link, some potatoes, and half the pancakes.  That says something.SECOND VISIT: My first reaction holds true the second time.  The coffee wasn't very good.  The eggs were okay and the potatoes decent.  Bacon once again was perfect.  The muffin french toast was awful. and was left unfinished.",

I tried one of their newer omelets, and it was surprisingly tasty.  I had that problem where I was too full to eat more but wanted to keep eating...  The service, however, leaves much to be desired.The first time I went was on a Sunday around noon, so it was pretty busy.  My boyfriend and I stood in front of the podium waiting for someone to come to put our names on the list.  When someone finally came, he first took the name of someone who had come in after us, like we weren't even there.  It took a while to be seated, but that's understandable since it was about time for Sunday brunch.The second time was again on a Sunday around noon, but it wasn't near as busy.  Our waitress took our orders promptly, but afterwards, the quality of service plummeted.  My water glass was empty for at least 15 minutes before getting a refill, twice.  The waitress had walked past our table many times, but didn't even look at us to see how we were doing.  Our food took forever to come, and I understand there were five of us so that can take a while, but this was ridiculous.  And the waitress didn't say a thing the whole time.  When the food did come, it was warm, so at least the meal itself was good.  I asked for a box, but it never came.  I ended up asking for one at the counter myself to avoid waiting probably another half hour.  Overall, our waitress stopped at our table maybe five times total, and never apologized for the long wait or even noticed that we were pretty upset with our service.  In addition, several of the other employees were arguing loudly in earshot of customers, which I think is pretty unprofessional.I can't say I'd recommend going here, and if you do, expect to wait.",

This place does not offer vegetarian-friendly lunch options. I ended up getting the tomato basil soup and the wedge salad without the bacon. Both were subpar.2. The service staff showed little effort. After my waitress carelessly placed the water on my table, she just threw my straw in front of me and hurriedly proceeded to serve the neighboring table. Wow. What's more is that my wedge salad was hastily assembled--the iceberg lettuce was stacked in chunks and the bleu cheese was piled on one side. 3. The booth I sat at was not well-cleaned, and the table was sticky. How the heck this happened is beyond me.The only thing holding me back from giving them 1 star is that their pastries at the front counter look well made. Sorry, Perkins. You're never seeing me again.",

I ordered the new bacon, mushroom and onion skillet and I loved it. It has an Alfredo sauce over potatoes, grilled mushrooms & onion, bacon and cheddar cheese. I know it sounds like a heart attack on a plate but it was so good. I had a blueberry muffin also and it came out hot with butter on the side. Although I was very pleased with the meal the reason I am giving such a low rating is for the service. I ran out of water and was looking for my waitress to ask for more. It took a really long time for her to show up again. It also took more than a half an hour for our food to come out of the kitchen after we ordered. With only an hour for lunch that is unacceptable.",

When the ice had brought down all the electrical, once, and the roads were sheets of ice, a death-defying trek to Perkins, who promptly saved Christmas, one year!Whenever we couldn't make up our mind about anywhere else, the answer was always Perkins, and this location (on University) always met the call.  A warm pancake stack, with an ice cream scoop sized wad of butter melting in!  The aforementioned French Silk pie, a slice of it just as a treat.  Even their hot turkey plate-- a real Butterball turkey, slow cooked, with amazing \"fixin's\".  I mean... food doesn't have to be froo froo for me in order to be _good_, _wholesome_, and made with love.  So many meals I've had here, and I'd say that the vast majority of them have been something special!Perkins is super reasonable on price.  The restaurant is a little dated, now, but you just _can't_ judge this book by its cover.

Old Time can meet almost all of your meat eating needs and they do have a customer appreciation card where you get 10% off your next purchase when you purchase $200 worth at the store. Their sausages are quite good and their special flavors (applewursts you should try for sure!) change but they still have the classic bratwursts and mild and spicy italian sausage. Their flank steak is also good and their bulk italian sausage is also worth your while especially if you make spaghetti sauce from scratch. My complaint is that their hours and location could be better. Their staff is always helpful and they can help with getting special meat cuts.",

                "review": "I'm a student without a car and I walk a few miles round-trip and taking the bus just to come to Old Time for all my deli and meat needs. Though their selection is pretty extensive, ranging from USDA prime cuts, homemade plates, seafood, frozen stuff, a barrel of pickles, variety of cheeses, etc. The place has the family/homey vibe and that's what seems to set it apart from the very institutionalized food that students like me are used to on and close to campus. But I've matured enough in taste to realize that quality food usually doesn't come from Walmart or Meijer, and that the trek to Old Time is worth it even in the dead of winter for the friendly service, local feel, and most importantly, exceptional food.I've had quite a few things from here, I particularly enjoy the deli roast beef and pepperoni. As far as meats go I'm a big fan of the petite sirloins and also the filets. I've got a couple crab cakes in the freezer that I haven't tried yet but look amazing. The large twice-baked or loaded potatoes are absolutely to die for! The only things I don't much care for here are the coleslaw and provolone cheese, the latter is the \"picante\" provolone and it isn't the same as what I get back home, it seems.The prices to me are maybe a little higher than average, but you definitely get what you pay for in terms of quality and you know the money is in local hands. Quality and locality are two factors that I often consider to overshadow price and should be especially important aspects to anyone who cares about what they eat. Regardless, Old Time is the water in the figurative desert when it comes to having quality meat, seafood and other food items in the Champaign-Urbana area.",

But, anything you need at Old Time, they can get it for you.  Even rare game, a lot of times.  Once, I had them get me some quail.  They also got me buffalo burger when I wanted it (and they weren't carrying it).  And the quality, too!  For the price you're paying at a Walmart, I mean... just skip it!  Never buy that nasty meat again.  Old Time'll do your 80/20 Chuck for your burgers, they'll do your bone-in ribeyes, they'll give you a pork butt, or shoulder!  I mean.. whatever.  For such reasonable prices, it's a wonder everyone doesn't shop there.Oh wait, they do! =D  You can tell just by the parking lot.  There are two lots that sort of bump up to the front and side easements, but these lots are pretty small (like 7-12 cars per, I'd guess).  There are times you actually have to wait for a space to open up so you can park and run in.  And it's not unusual for someone to be all cattywampus in a space or NINE (I'm looking at you, SUVs =P), so!  Parking can be a bit tricky.I wanted to mention that it's not all just fresh meat from their deli case, either!   They've got cheeses, desserts (frozen and fresh), OH, and the best part of all, I can't believe I almost forgot this!  They carry the Beef House rolls!  They're in the freezer section, in paper bags, but they're perfectly PERFECT.  Take a few home to keep in the freezer for when an uninvited guest shows up for dinner.  They'll praise your pastry prowess! ;DJust pure, honest good stuffs, from some people who really know themselves some food!",

You can't beat the atmosphere, great smiles from the staff, amazing music selection and drink options.Some of the food can be a bit expensive, but once you bite into your first toasted Reuben or Cuban sandwich, it's totally worth it.Their bagel special or their breakfast sandwiches  for breakfast/ brunch after a long night ( don't forget the coffee ) make Aroma a great place for breakfast too.I've played board games, studied, worked remotely, met people to catch up etc. all at this little great cafe. Love it, sometimes I don't know where I'd be without a coffee of the day and a smile, and I know I'll find that everytime at Aroma.",

Every latte I've had from Aroma has been simply delicious and perfect to taste.  You should definitely try the cranberry and brie sexy toast!  It's taste like a slice of thanksgiving in your mouth...I crave it often! Also try their soups!  They always change up their soup menu, can't go wrong!  One thing that I really enjoy about this spot is it's an older crowd not a ton of college kids that are camping out like Kopi so there's always a place for you to relax while you sip away on your coffee.",

The Italian soda was pretty normal, using Da Vinci syrup.Both the roast beef wrap and mango chicken wrap were fresh and light with a good mix of flavors. The cream cheese is from local sources which you can clearly taste from the first bite. The sides of salad and fruit were both fresh and flavorful.I will definitely return here on my next trip downstate.",

Understated Middle-Eastern sides like hummus and tabouleh further enhance a menu that still includes classic Aroma fare like the Cuban sandwich and quesadillas.Aroma has come a long way in a short time.

I am still looking for a place like this in Chicago.The only downside is the corrupt little ***hole that the city of Champaign is, which imagines itself to be downtown Chicago or Manhattan.  In other words, the biggest problem with this place is that you need to run out every two hours to feed the stupid meter.  But, of course, that's not Aroma's fault so they get 5 stars from me, and if you read my other reviews, you'll see that I don't give out stars that easily.",

Their Aroma Salad is so yummy - usually not a fan of those kind of salads (i'm in the basic kind, not fancy with nuts, etc.) but I enjoyed it a lot. Their mugs you get if you're drinking there are huge. Probably a better deal than a to-go cup but not sure what the actual measure is.

I mean of course Chicago or New York has MUCH better coffee houses than Aroma Cafe, but if you're in Champaign-Urbana Aroma Cafe is as good as it gets, at least coffee wise. Enviornment: 3.5/5, Drinks: 5/5Their prices are insanely reasonable and they give out a generous discount for bringing your own cup. The quality of the beans is also very good, which rocks. While Cafe Kopi (the coffee house just a street away from Aroma Cafe) roasts very well too, they can't make drinks worth shit. They don't even know how to steam milk! I got a latte their once and the milk wasn't steamed, just warmed up with the steam wand. I also rate Aroma Cafe highly because their prep, the way they make the drinks, is very good. Aroma Cafe actually uses a manual grinder for their espresso drinks! It's amazing! :D Most places just put the group head into an automatic. Their back bar might need a tid bit of work but I mean I'm getting really picky. I just feel bad for the usual lone barista doing all of the work.In any case, if you're in Champaign-Urbana and want a quality cup of coffee this is the place to go. Cafe' Paradiso's just too expensive and every other coffe house has no idea what their doing.",

The coffee menu is limited and the baristas don't know how to make anything that's not explicitly on the menu (that's cool because this should not be expected of them, but it's just a major downside).I asked if they made cold brew and they offered me hot espresso on ice. That worries me. The food is very basic, low-involvement, no special ingredients, yet pricey. Also worth mentioning, the WiFi is abhorrent. Connection is too weak in all areas of the restaurant to even display text. And your session expires after a few hours and you are not able to start a second one. Just a heads up for people who want to stay and study. I don't know if it was a purposeful way to boot campers out. I've never had this happen to me at a cafe. Finally, the background music is awful, in my opinion. They play nonstop 80s pop: Cyndi Lauper, Michael Jackson, Olivia Newton-John, etc. So bring headphones if you're not into that.",

The embarrassing light jazz track that they were playing was way too loud, and much more appropriate for, say, a hotel lobby than a downtown cafe.",

The atmosphere is usually quieter than Kopi, and there is plenty of seating on most days; the staff is friendly and polite and know their way around a kitchen. There are outlets all along the walls, and free wifi, if that's what you're looking for. *See edit*I'm addicted to the vanilla chai, but I really go there for the raspberry white chocolate scones. I challenge you to find a better scone in the world! Okay, well, maybe not the world, but they trump any pastry in every coffee shop I've ever visited. When I've been on the road, this is the first place I come back to. Aroma is home!Also, the salsa here is amazing. It is house-made and there are two kinds: try the one with the peaches. I get it as a side with my cheese quesadilla, which is also tasty and totally worth spending my lunch money on!Edit: 5/20/2012Since I last reviewed Aroma, it has gone through a lot of changes, including new ownership. What's bad about this is they took away almost every single thing I loved. Those unparalleled raspberry white chocolate scones? Gone. Now they serve bloated English scones from Sweet Indulgences that are as dry and tasteless as the Sahara. Massive, extraordinary fail. I mean, there used to be epic Scone Wars over Aroma's scones--I used to try to beat these elderly ladies who worked downtown to the cafe to get my share. For real. Now the new scones just sit on a plate, untouched and unwanted, fat blobs of loathing. Anybody who likes them never had the original, heavenly scones of old. They're not even in the same category of pastry, I tell you. They offer other pastries from Sweet Indulgences, too, but they're all really expensive and not what I would eat for breakfast. (Old habits die hard.) They still sell apple fritters, I guess.They tried to get rid of my beloved chai, as well, but then the new baristas were too mentally challenged to make bagged chai tea and they had to revert back to the mix. I guess leaving a tea bag in a cup of steamed milk requires too much comprehension. I'm glad for it, anyway, because if natural bagged chai is your thing, nobody in town is better than Kopi, which is just around the block. Competing against them is just a waste of time, so they're safer to keep the chai mix and go with what their customers already know and love.Also, that amazing peach salsa? Yup, it's gone now, too. Forever. The whole menu has been revamped to have fancier, slightly healthier offering. I haven't been desperate enough to try any of their new food items except for the fruit salad, which is basically a bowl of chopped fruit with a yummy syrup over it, and that was good, but it was just for breakfast. I will say they seem to have spared most of their old menu's wraps and other lunch items for the time being. The Wi-Fi is also password-protected now (\"sexytoast\" is the key). At least they didn't insert that proposed \"kid corner\" they threatened us with earlier during the revamp. That would've sent me running for the hills instantly. As someone who comes in here regularly to find quiet and write, I can tell you the very last thing I want is to share space with a corner of screaming, running toddlers. I deducted Aroma a star for all of this, but find it hard to give it less than 4 stars. I've been coming to Aroma for seven years, so I think of it as my home away from home, even if it currently is a shell of what it once was. Some of the other regular customers I used to see in here are thinning out. I guess all of this will make it easier for when I move from Champaign, because now it's just depressing.",

The caps are usually good -- until last Sunday. The tired guy behind the counter was in a big hurry to get on with his life, apparently, because instead of a cappuccino, he made a latte. The other guy behind the counter practically argued with me when I explained the drink was \"wrong\" simply by the sheer weight of the cup. Finally, they redid it, but it was still the worst cappuccino I have ever had there.The atmosphere is nice, and food is not bad. However, the snack selection is practically non-existent. For that, you gotta hit Pekara next door.Odd Aroma Cafe story: one Sunday, I ask for a San Pellegrino. The tall kid behind the counter says he can't serve it to me. \"Why?\" I ask. \"Because I'm under-age\" comes the answer. Wooot! You gotta be kidding, kid. After picking myself up off the floor, I explain it's fizzy water, he asks someone for help, I get the bottle (no brown paper bag) and we get outta there. And with this story, I just realized I am one step closer to the yuppies I'd always mocked. Well, I will suck it up.",

My first week in town consisted primarily of the hunt for \"the right\" coffee shop where the words \"extra foamy\" meant the wet foam, not dry, to provide a perfect foundation for latte art. If you know latte, then you must know Cafe Aroma. The consistency from barista to barista is not the same, so I send a word of caution. I have my favorite latte rainmaker, and I ask him for his schedule so I can come when he's there. I'm serious. The owner also is there often, and he absolutely knows what he is doing when it comes to making the perfect latte. Things like this are too important to play with. Go straight to Cafe Aroma and save yourself $30 of bad experimentation at the other coffee shops in town.",

It's typically got people but it's never overly busy or loud, which is a big plus and their WiFi works pretty well. Thirdly, what really does it for me, is that baristas are all incredibly friendly and kind. I have had lots of little conversations with them and they are always polite and courteous.

Mmm the best! Aroma didn't disappoint their version of the Cuban very close to the Miami one. Everything else terrific. Added bonus: stroke up a conversation with Jerry, terrific guy, wearing a UF gator shirt, told him about our Cuban food and drink craving and ....dios mio!

For a SMALL espresso drink that didn't taste like it had any espresso in it, I paid $3.80.  Whaa?I do like that the sandwiches and such come with a choice of side, and that none of the sides will cost you extra.  At Cafe Kopi, you have to pay extra for certain sides, including the side salad.  I liked the salad that came with my wrap, although there were a few pieces of wilted/gross lettuce.  I was underwhelmed by the wrap but would probably try a full-size salad from here.However, since Cafe Kopi is right around the corner and serves way better drinks, I don't know if I'll ever bother giving Aroma Cafe a second chance.",

Aroma is a restraunt that is something the American people need in order to get our countrys economy, weight, and sense of community back on track. The menu was recently revamped. So if you havnt been here in 6 months give it another shot. My experience today was flawless. The atmosphere is upbeat, well lit, and friendly. The staff is friendly, personable, and knowledgable. The food was delivered to my table in a timely manner, presented with care, and was quality product. I will be coming here for lunch more often.",

The food is good, but their portions are a little small. A lunch with a large coffee is always $8-9. For $5.95 pretax, you get one of their sandwiches and moderately generous side of fruit salad, salad, or chips. They are cheaper than Pekara and Kopi. Make sure you check out their soup of the day, as they are always good and a soup and an Aroma sandwich combo is guaranteed to satisfy. They have pastries for sale, but I don't know why. The pastries at Pekara (next door) are way better. They also have a morning Bagel and Coffee deal for $3.50 that is pretty good: they have a bunch of different bagel and cream cheese varieties.They also offer a discount if your work in Downtown Champaign, but they do not advertise this.",

They have boundless flavors to choose from, but the flavors that I have had were a little too sweet for my taste, a bit more like Starbucks-sweet than I would prefer. Additionally, although I have never ordered coffee from here, I had some of my friend's on my last visit, and it was nothing memorable. I may come back one day to try the food, but when it comes to coffee drinks, there are plenty of other places in Champaign-Urbana that I can go to.",

The food is also quite good, unlike a lot of other coffee shops I've tried.  Try the quesadilla or the Aroma Salad.  Good music, too!  My only beef with them is that they close super-early in the evenings during semester break, meaning that those of us who actually LIVE here don't get to partake while the students are gone.  I would understand if Aroma were located closer to campus and got the vast majority of their business from college students, but every time I'm there, I see quite a few non-students, so I see no reason for them to close early.",

It has goat cheese, nuts, berries and of course greens. This isn't what I usually like (nuts and berries in a salad), but it comes with house dressing, and it was very good as well. Total for the wrap and side (not including drink, as I got a free glass of water you pour yourself) was about $8. That's a good deal in my opinion, as 1/2 the wrap filled me up, and I'm a guy.

It's mostly street parking, but I found lots of spots right out front.The lovely lady working welcomed us right away, and she was very helpful with her suggestions. I decided on a large light roast Ethiopian and an oatmeal, and the Mister got a large dark roast of some sort and a cinnamon roll as big as my head. The ceramic coffee mugs were huge, and the coffee was delicious. They even had organic cane syrup to sweeten it! My oatmeal was pre-packaged, but it was one of the healthier brands without anything artificial or tons of sugar. The Mister loved his goodies as well.The interior of Aroma Cafe is very cozy, but we decided to sit on the patio out back. It felt secret garden-ish, and it was the perfect setting for a lazy Sunday breakfast. If you're in the CU area, then you should totally check out this place.

There's nothing more frustrating than getting to a cafe that either a) has wireless, but you gotta pay for it, or b) has free wireless, but only two outlets for the patrons to fight over.After ordering my hummus plate, I grabbed a table by the wall, plugged myself in, connected to the free internet, and spent a nice evening relaxing....  at least that's what I would've liked to have said.  I was actually scrambling to finish an assignment before they closed up for the day, haha.

They are never as packed as Kopi and it is quieter than Kopi. My favorite drink to get here is the Italian cream soda with the many different flavors they offer.

Now the sign says \"For Now Hours\" so who knows what it will be next time?  They didn't have anything that looked that tempting, but I had a huge sweet tooth, and tried a brownie.  It was hard as a rock.  I should have taken it back, but I didn't because I would have had to sit their and drink my coffee anyway since I was given one of their tiny \"here\" cups (which probably wouldn't have taken me too long in reality).~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~update 11/15/2008:I have dropped Aroma just an \"eh\" rating...Cafe Kopi was horribly crowded, so I trudged back out into the cold and headed to Aroma.  There was a nice size table free, and it's much brighter in there (which I found jarring at first, but got used to it).  I ordered my standard \"Grande House Coffee\" and when asked \"for here or to go\" I said \"for here\" because I had planned to stay to do some homework.  Well she gave me my coffee in this tiny little mug.  I asked her, \"Is this a grande?\" and she looked at me, said yes, and showed me an even tinier mug for their smalls.  There was not 16 oz of hot coffee in that tea cup.  Barely 12 oz would be my guess.  They TOTALLY short change you on the \"for here\" cups, so I would recommend getting a \"to go\" cup even if you plan on staying.  Which is unfortunate when \"going green\" is the thing to do...  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~On an early Sunday right after moving to Champaign, I was wandering around the downtown area to see what was around, and stopped in here for a coffee and a muffin.  It's cute, there's lots of tables, free WiFi (although I didn't have my computer, I saw a couple of people with laptops out), and the people behind the counter were nice.  There's a comfy spot in the back with couches and chairs and a fireplace!  (not sure if it works though)  And they have an outdoor area as well.  The coffee was good, and if you buy one of their travel mugs, you get a discount every time you bring it in to get your coffee.  The hours are great for studying.  Overall: it's cute, and I can see myself heading back there in the future.",

It's warm and welcoming - cozy enough for setting up a work station for an afternoon, or just for stopping in for a coffee to go. I appreciated the friendly service and the selection of quality brews they had to offer. You just can't beat iced coffee that is made to order, freshly brewed on the spot rather than being served from a big pitcher of premade refrigerated coffee. I also had one of the lemon cake balls and oh good grief that was delicious! The center of the cake ball had something similar to a lemon curd, which was a very pleasant tart surprise. I want to come back just to get a few more (okay maybe like a dozen) of these naughty little bites!",

This past weekend we had some time to kill before lunch so we stopped in Aroma for a drink. It was a gorgeous Saturday so we were able to take advantage of their backyard patio. It's pretty much your average coffee shop, but a few things stand out. One - they have sugar free almond syrup. Yum! It's one of my favorite flavors, but rarely do I find it in the sugar free variety. Two - they have a fireplace. I'm assuming it works, although I've never actually been in Aroma when it's on. Third - they have a nice patio. Although I really wish they would upgrade their patio chairs. They have the flimsy plastic kind that suck. Spend a few more bucks and get something similar to your neighbor, Pekara.Their bakery case never looks too appealing. I'd skip on over to Pekara if you're looking for a nosh, but Aroma is a-ok for a coffee or tea.",

My biggest fear was my kiddos knocking things down. The carts are small otherwise I would have put both of them in there to contain them. My worries soon disappeared when a lady working behind the counter engaged my toddlers in a conversation while I quickly found the items I was looking for. The staff is friendly and welcoming and there is a great selection of goods.",

However, consider other options before you actually buy something.  It's almost definitely cheaper elsewhere.  If you don't feel like shopping around or stopping at multiple stores to get what you need, just be aware that you're paying extra for the convenience of a one-stop-shop.  Also, check expiration dates.  I forgot to do so last time I shopped here, and ended up with some lovely stale food.  I do like to stop here and buy a few things as an occasional indulgence, but in general it's just too expensive.Their halva is fantastic, though--seriously, the best.",

I'm a snob.  Because I want more.  I'd like a bigger cheese selection with more of a display and some fois gras.  Not that kibbi isn't also excellent, but I'd like you to indulge my stuffwhitepeoplelike attitude just a tad bit more please.  The store could also stand to have a couple hundred more square feet, perhaps filled with a nice wine selection.  There really aren't enough places to buy a decent Malbec in this town, maybe this place could be one?All in all, an excellent establishment that I will never be able to just walk past.  Surely one piece of baklava can't hurt me.",

My only critique would be that the Asian goods and foods are waaay overpriced. If you're willing to dig around a bit, there are some great Asian food stores in the area, like Am-Ko, Green Onion and Far East.

We ordered the baba ganoush and falafel sandwiches and a vegetarian platter.  The falafel was microwaved and lost any texture it might have had when first prepared.  It had no distinguishable flavor.  The baba was so smoky, that I couldn't finish the sandwich.  Three bites overwhelmed my palette completely.  We had already purchased the dessert and gave them a shot, because they were aesthetically very pleasing.  Unfortunately, the birds nest was soft (so sad) and the date cookie was crumbled and poorly prepared.  I've never thrown away so much food.  Maybe we came on an off day, but based on our experience, my recommendation is to shut it down.  You've got a great store, why compromise your credibility with this food?",

I've been in town for 4 years and just discovered World Harvest.The owner and staff are very welcoming and helpful, which shows that they take pride in their business.  There is a very extensive selection of food from all over the world, with a delicious looking deli/cheese selection as well.  I was able to find an Eastern European bread that I've been looking for, a great looking frozen Indian dish, and my favorite French biscuits, all in one trip.  Unlike some other places, this store is clean and well organized.  I really look forward to coming back again.",

I do enjoy the taro milk tea though! I also really like their cartoon animal cups and lid covers that sort of teach you Chinese fruit names. Depending on when you come, there may be a large crowd of people, which means your order will take some time to make as they make everything to order - nothing is premade. Also, they don't allow for customizations. You can only get what's offered on the menu - no fruit substitutions, etc. Unfortunately, there are only two tables to sit at, so you'll likely be standing around while waiting. I hope they'll get more chairs and tables because there's a lot more room in the shop.My one pet peeve is that some of the fruit syrup they use to flavor their milk teas tastes weirdly artificial. I got a strawberry milk tea and it tasted like I was drinking a liquid, watered down strawberry ring pop. I tried a friend's mango green tea and it was ridiculously sweet with a tang of mango. Otherwise, it's not very remarkable milk tea that would make me come back.I'd give them two and a half stars, but I bumped it to three because the service is really nice and the employees do try very hard to get the orders correct. Also, when I came on Friday as they were closing up and finishing the last orders, the owner lady gave me and my friends free drinks to try anyway, which was sweet of her. Everything on the menu is relatively inexpensive and under $5.",

They just opened up recently or maybe even today.  Looks nice and clean and they have like way more workers than they probably need. I ended up getting a taro bubble tea and the gf got matcha milk tea.  Not sure if it's a promo or something but the tea was free!  Whoo hoo.  Anyway,  the bubble tea was delicious for 4.50 for a large. Would definitely come back if I come down for a visit again to try a new flavor.",

If you've had a bad drink, I encourage you to go back and try something else - they have tons of things on their menu (especially since they just added a lot of new things) like boiled tofu, chicken wings, and great shaved snow ice in several flavors (taro, coconut, mango, chocolate, green tea, etc.) in addition to lots of great drinks.

It isn't made too sweet, but isn't too bland, either.The staff there are friendly, price is reasonable and with the new addition of the daily 25% off specials as well as having met my current boyfriend here, I have no choice but to give it 5 stars!",

                "review": "Party of 12 on a Saturday? Lets try BW in Savoy... oh wait, it's a UFC night. They didn't even offer a wait time, just sort of laughed and were like \"yeah right\". So, we're like \"where do you want to go?\" looked around (while standing outside bw) and there's restaurants all over the place. How about the BBQ place right next to Tucks... \"i don't like bbq\" why not \"i don't like bbq\" THEY HAVE OTHER THINGS!!! Applebees? It's right there... no... geebus... how about... (name every restaurant)... finally... BRIXX. She calls, yes, we can get in. Whoo hoo a decision!!!Drive down the street, drive around the building a couple times, hoping to find a parking spot. That may be the worst thing about BRIXX, is the parking is terrible. Go inside, seated right away. Oddly, only know 1 person who was working there, and she was the hostess (i believe). Menu's are passed. Beer list is perused. Hey, look, there's always a Triptych on tap. That's great. The draft list is all craft, and that's awesome. There are no macros on tap. I assume this is upsetting to many people the first (maybe only?) time they go there. \"What do you mean you don't have bud light on tap???\" I'd assume is asked by crusty old people. \"Back in my day, a restaurant would have Budweiser, Miller, Coors AND Pabst on tap! I suppose I can't even get a HAMM'S in here?!?!?!\" Hey, whaddyaknow, they have macros in bottles. \"Well, why didn't you tell me that?\"  Craft food deserves craft beer. The lady and I both order the Triptych, the Blue and the Gold. She believes it tastes better than when it was at the brewery, so that's odd. Beer is promptly served. It doesn't appear that it was in a frosty pint glass either, so that's good too. There is also craft rootbeer on tap, so that's cool. They seem to have some staples in intro craft, like Fat Tire, Sam Adams, but the list is nice. It's not going to be a place to go to for \"I've never even HEARD of this beer\" (from the craft beer drinkers) but the BMC drinkers will be exclaiming that, except in anger. I order the 4x4. So does the lady. The manager brings over a Mediterranean salad, apparently an extra one had been made, and he decided to bring it to our table (he must know i'm a yelper!... or maybe he's just nice). Bill eats the salad. Courtney eats the bread, she seemed to like the bread. Others at the table ordered other things. Court got the ravioli, the waitress was awesome and asked if she wanted the tomatoes on it, and court was like no. The waitress was awesome, did i mention that. She was like \"i'm a picky eater too, and you look like you'd be a picky eater\" which was really nice. There were 2 young boys in our group, and they went over and drew on the chalkboard, and one of the bussers brought them out extra chalk to draw with, and that was really nice. Man, those people were really nice. The pizzas come out. I devour mine. Apparently, the reason i don't really like pizza is the sauce. The 4x4 doesn't have red sauce, it's an olive oil. So, maybe that's why i don't like pizza. Who knew? I remember as a kid, eating some frozen pizzas, every now and then, one of those Tino's (or similar) would have a sauce that we would call \"watermelon pizza\". I also hate pizza hut. As a youth, when John and I would drive around Pontiac, we'd sometimes eat at pizza hut. Well, we'd drink... sometimes too much. It was then that i discovered the acidity in the pizza hut sauce is almost exactly the same acidity that is regularly in my stomach. So, when i'd throw up from drinking too much, it would taste exactly the same. As an adult, I don't drink to that point. So, the 4x4 was amazing. I don't do desert. Kansas was losing the first half of the game while I was there. I leave and they win by like 20, wtf? Tres Tinkle was having a great first half. I leave and suddenly Kansas remembers how to play?The 3 bean salad was great. Not a typical three bean salad either. Red beans, black beans and garbanzos (i realize everyone poops, but that doesn't mean i want to see chick pee's!)",

First, we were seated at a table directly in front of the swinging kitchen door. Upon being seated an emplyeed barreled out the door and smack into me. Then we ordered the Brixx Sticks and got them after about 20 minutes, first we thought they were cheese filled because the middle was gooey, then we realized our Brizz Sticks were basically raw. Sent them back and asked for new, upon waiting another 20 minutes we got our pizza...still no Brixx Sticks. We told our server just take them off the bill, the woman training our server did not like that and tried to convince us to take them to go even though we told her we didnt want them anymore as we already got our meal. Lastly, the pizza was undercooked and dry. My husbands pizza was significantly smaller than mine, all the pizzas are supposed to be 10\". He order his pizza without goat cheese and they put in on the pizza anyway. A friend of our was supposed to be running this place but passed away shortly before open. We really wanted to love this place, but we will probably never go back. The staff seamed nice but the food just wasn't cooked.",

                "review": "For being a pizza-rich town, we've been surprisingly short of wood-fired options. Now all of a sudden there are two, maybe a third on its way in downtown. This one is a franchise and doesn't surprise me that it's a bit mediocre. We tried it out after its first month of being open, figuring the kinks would be shaken out by then. It was a busy football night, but late, after the initial dinner crowd was winding down. We were seated by the hostess then abandoned for about 20 minutes, even though the place was not so busy that all the tables were filled. She was just distracted yakking with a pal. When finally discovered about to leave, we were assigned a harried but competent waitress (who was tipped well for catching up for us). No obvious manager around, and certainly not the type that would pitch in and clean the messed-up bathroom or pick up paper or other droppings on the floor near us.Anyway, the whole premise of a wood-fired oven seems like false advertising, because it looks like there's a gas flame burning in the back of that oven, with a small pile of wood thrown on the side to dress it up. And the results are not really up to what one expects from this style of preparation. The crust is not as thin and lightly prepared as classic neopolitan, and of the two pizzas we ordered, one was decently charred, the other pale an unfinished. That was the margherita, which can be excused for its drab tomatoes for this region and season, but the cheese should have been closer to a fresh buffala style rather than low moisture and stretchy/chewy.The appetizers were fine, really enjoyed the hummus and crust \"chips\", and the caesar salad was also fine. But overall this is not the wood-fired pizza destination I wish it would be. Sure, we can't expect a Pizzeria Bianco in this sized town, but something as good as Settebello Pizzeria Napoletana (Henderson NV) should be possible. So far, the best option is actually the Dragonfire pizza truck, but they also have some issues with not quite \"getting it\". But they do have a really good crust going, and you can't go wrong with their basic pepperoni pizza.",

This is a shared parking lot with Moe's.... it's kind of like that parking lot up at the Starbucks on Prospect.... small and narrow.... so you have two fairly middle-of-the-road chain restaurants sharing a one lane parking row.   I'm already off to a bad experience here.   As you walk in, it is actually very nice.... lots of seating and a clear view of the wood-burning oven.  The menu is fairly large --- lots of choices for all types of palettes -- salads, appetizers, pastas and pizzas.   The waitresses are friendly and they were hamming it up with my five-year old son, who was supplied with crayons and a little booklet.   He loves pineapple on his pizza so he put in the order for a Hawaiian pizza and I ordered a greek-like salad.     The waitress brought water and my first sip, there was a little piece of clear plastic floating in it... yuck.  Don't know what that was about but it seemed harmless.  The food came about 10 minutes later and the salad was huge.... with a huge chunk of bread.   I ate about half of it and took the rest home.   The pizza came out --- it was about 10 inches, cut into six slices.   The crust was thin and foldable....which I like, but it was fairly tasteless.... there wasn't any tomato sauce on it, and am not sure if the description said it was a sauce-less pie or not... but my son didn't seem to mind it.... he was just happy about having pineapple and ham (or prosciutto to be more specific) on his pizza!   My real gripe about this pizza was the amount of cheese.... it was so much.   It was gooey and melty which was a good thing, but there was this layer of grease sitting on top of the pie which was off-putting and made it very salty....We easily finished it because we were pretty hungry and frankly, it isn't that much better than Papa John's or Jet's.... just lighter (in terms of crust and texture) but just the same amount of greasiness.   I would choose this place over Monical's...but it still ranks in the low-mid range of pizza places in town.    My top 5 list is still:  Dragon Fire, Antica Pizza, Pizza M, Jet's and Papa Del's.   I still haven't tried Azzip so that's why it's not on the list..... the bottom 3 of my list are in no particular order, it just depends on what style of pizza I want.",

                "review": "Our small family tried Brixx tonight. We love wood-fire brick-oven pizza. Two of us had the pizza and one of us tried the meatball sub with black bean salad. We also tried the Korean bbq meatball appetizer, and I had a Brixx house salad as a side. Neither pizza lover gave Brixx pizza top marks. The crust was not especially crispy. The blackening on the bottom lent a bitter flavor. To the good, the ingredients were high quality. I loved the pear-gorgonzola topping with walnuts and carmelized onions, although the onions were sauteed at best and not at all carmelized (they were out of the butternut squash-goat cheese pizza, so this was my second pick). The more traditional cheese pizza was just passable. The Korean bbq meatball appetizer did not taste Korean (and I'm a Korean food lover), and came with pineapples chopped up as a garnish -- it didn't go with the flavor profile of the meatballs, but it didn't fight against it either. The meatballs were tender and tasty in a generic way. The side salad was good, too, with goat cheese and pistachios. It hadn't been seasoned and the dressing wasn't balanced (too little acid in the vinaigrette). The meatball sub could not be held, and that's a pet peeve of ours. If you can't pick it up, it's not a sandwich. The toppings were somewhat off-putting in terms of texture, but the meatballs were good, with Italian seasoning. The bean salad side received a 7.2 out of 10. Good but not great.The music was on too loud and the tables were not well cleared or cleaned. Our waitress was the only one on duty when we arrived and the place was filling up, but there seemed to be a lot of other staff. She was good and friendly, but overtaxed. The place has double sets of doors, but the inside doors were open. Hard to know why. Restaurant staff should be aware that this lets in flies, and sure enough, it did.We didn't feel cheated, but we probably won't be back.",

We both ordered water and a pizza. I got the artichoke hearts veggie option and my husband got the Caribbean jerk pizza. We then sat there unattended until a different server brought out our pizzas. I asked him to bring our drinks and he apologized and got them. The pizzas looked good visually when delivered but there was a lot of crust as I ate and my toppings were not evenly spread. Two of the pieces literally had no artichoke on them. My husband said his was not much better. The sauce on the Caribbean jerk pizza was not evenly spread so not every bite was flavorful. The crust was not good by itself so we both had a pile of crust at the end. We did not see our server again, but the waiter that delivered our food and drinks stopped to see if we needed anything else. I asked for the check and he asked who our server was. I told him I did not know. The server then reappeared and the checks aid his name was Sam G. We paid and left. Truly disappointed in the food and service.",

The price was right. I got the lunch special, 1/2 pizza and 1/2 salad, which is available Monday-Friday between 11am-3pm for $7.95. Great value. I had the mediterranean salad and rustica pizza. Both were outstanding! Definitely recommend. Some reviewers seem to be complaining that there wasn't any sauce on the pizza.. Read the menu before you order. If there is a hollow yellow circle next to the item, the crust is brushed with olive oil. If there is a red filled in circle, the crust has traditional red pizza sauce. The manager was very visible and friendly. My only complaint, and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is where we were seated. The place was virtually empty, but we were seated in a booth right next to the entrance. The restaurant phone kept ringing quite loudly directly behind me. Something to keep in mind for those in charge.",

I had the rustica pizza without olives, which was tasty. Pretty generous on the toppings but I do think the mushrooms were underdone and they appeared almost raw to the eye. I also thought the whole cloves of garlic were a little excessive even though I love garlic. The Bronx bomber pizza was pretty good as well and again, generous with toppings. They have a really wide variety of different pizzas so pretty much anyone can find something they like. Aside from the food, our server was extremely friendly and helpful. Overall a good experience, don't know if I would make an effort to go back, but it's definitely not a bad choice if you're in the mood for pizza.",

Order that one for your picky eater child. My favorite is jerk chicken. When I suggested that their beer offerings did not include enough dark beers, their manager asked for a recommendation and within the month they had it on tap (Founders Porter). Their Left Hand Stout is also excellent. A local micro brew also supplies great offerings. Champaign has some great pizza offerings. Brixx thin crust brick oven pizza is unique. Few restaurants offer this kind of variety in toppings. And if there is one they haven't thought of, speak up. They listen to suggestions.",

With a simple menu and fresh atmosphere they have a fun vibe. Most anyone can't eat here. They have healthy options and full fatty pizzas. We have gone 5 times now! Out of all those times Sam has been out server at least 3. He was honest, helpful, friendly, fast and just all around a great server. One time we went and the kitchen was having a struggle bus day. They messed up both our pizzas! Mine was remade once and still they forgot the goat cheese. My husbands was remade 4 TIMES And still wasn't right... We ordered menus items with no customization, so I think the kitchen was just having a bad day. They were very nice about it and so where we. The manager was there that day, but we didn't talk to him. I have tried almost all the meat free options and all are amazing! My husband loves the 4x4, which is sauce free, but surprisingly good. They make the mozzarella in house and it's so good!!! The beer selection is pretty good too. We trie the root beer on tap too. I would highly recommend that! Give them a try and get your pizza fix at Brixx.",

I picked the thai chicken pizza because it has goat cheese on it and there were maybe 3 little globs of it on the whole pizza. My SO picked the buffalo chicken because it came with gorgonzola and he could barely taste it. I did like the crust, but both pizzas were totally forgettable.Also, the price and proportions seemed off. One pizza wouldn't have been quite enough for both of us but two pizzas was way too much. I thought it was a bit too pricey for what we got at about ~$12 a pizza.The atmosphere and the service were fine. Didn't hate it overall but definitely won't be going back.

(I added red sauce on the Bomber and the Florentine).The beer menu was excellent, and the prices have been reasonable and the beer specials (Wednesday, I believe) were outstanding. The kids menu was very good, and my kiddos just love their pizza and pasta at Brixx. What is more, they will give each kid a ball of dough that they can shape to their pleasing and they will throw it in the oven, and out comes their own creation! Great idea!I have not found Brixx to be overwhelmingly busy. The ambience is outstanding!The only thing I might grade them down on was that getting to their parking wasn't easy, given construction. But all things considered, that was minor.I'll be headed back soon.",

I had a Flat Iron Steak and fingerling potatoes w/blue cheese. Steak was cooked perfectly. Potatoes were tasty.Other people in our group were satisfied with their choices. (We tasted each other's dishes to verify the deliciousness.) Portabella burger, veggie burger, American Kobe burger, chipotle shrimp skewers, & chorizo stuffed dates wrapped in bacon were their choices. We had two appetizers - cheese curds & tempura-fried asparagus. Yum, yum.One of our dessertw was the highly-promoted banana cream pie. Good, but the bananas were over caramelized. (waiter apologized).All in all we were very happy with our experience. I hope to take other people to share the Destihl experience.",

Also really enjoy their coffee and fresh cream after any meal there. Still nothing terribly interesting however everything seems fresh and well executed. Also I am trying to tone down on being such a food snob so... 4 stars!! (throws confetti sarcastically)",

My group of 12 was immediately seated and drink orders were quickly taken. Service was interesting. Although our waiter was excellent, there seemed to be several uncertainties when drinks and food were brought to the table. Things got to where they needed to be, but I was surprised there seemed to be so much trouble just getting the orders to the correct guests.The food was wonderful! We had some excellent shared appetizers -- beer-battered asparagus, stone oven pretzels and beer-battered bacon. I had the Greekish salad and the cedar plank salmon. My wife had bacon & brussels and roasted beet salad. Others had a variety of chicken, seafood and meat entrees. For dessert my wife and I shared the chocolate cake.I tried a few of the four ounce beer samples and had a bloody mary. The beer was very good, the bloody mary excellent in presentation but only average in taste.We were not expecting to spend almost three hours having a leisurely dinner, but the evening was very nice. I was impressed with the general vibe for a Saturday night.All in all, I was impressed with Destihl and will definitely come back to try lunch or perhaps dinner with my wife or a smaller group.",

The restaurant decor is very modern and the menu is impressive - often offering delectable-sounding dishes and impressive combinations. That said, you may be disappointed upon arrival of your meal. The presentation is beautiful, but the taste is so bland. The first time I had a featured soup and sandwich - both just okay. The second time, I had their Rancher burger, which was wayyy overcooked (I asked for medium-rare and got very well done) and the fries were pretty bland. Some words about leftovers from Destihl: you don't want them. They are terrible as next-day meals. Overall, you'll have better luck for your taste buds and wallet by making a trip down the street to Dublin's.",

I don't have very much in the way of complaints about Destihl, but I don't exactly have much that makes me love the place either, especially since it is downtown and it has a lot of competition in the restaurant scene that does a better job. Let's start with the beer. To me, being a \"brewpub\", the quality of the beer is pretty sub par. I've had some good brews, but definitely some bad ones. I was here just last week and got a red ale that tasted more or less like fizzy cough syrup. Not the total end of the world, and beer taste is very subjective, but the beer here isn't exactly cheap and I feel like it's one of their main draws as a brewpub. On the other hand, I don't think I've ever had a bad experience with the food. They have great pizzas with a pretty neat variety of toppings and some pretty killer appetizers, the thai wings and the pretzels are a pretty normal addition to my dinners here. They will consistently cook a cheeseburger medium rare (sad that's something I have to even say) and the other entrees are usually pretty quality. They have a number of specials usually every week too. All in all, this place is certainly not bad, and I would feel a little more comfortable with giving it a 3.5 instead of a 3, but I would rather round down than up. If you haven't visited I definitely would check it out but after you've been here a couple of times I don't think you will get excited to go back.",

                "review": "I have never been more disappointed in my gastronomic experience in Urbana-Champaign then this past weekend at Destihl \"Brewery\" (who knows if they even brew beer at this place). Having been to Destihl a handful of times before the abominable brunch I suffered through this past weekend I expected an experience somewhat similar to what most people describe here on Yelp. That being a friendly staff, and decent (perhaps even good) food at reasonable prices. Unfortunately, Destihl has suffered a complete drain of quality over the last few years. When it opened, Destihl offered hot, quality food served my intellectual and friendly servers who were happy to be working in one of Champaign's better restaurants. Each time I dined at Destihl I noticed the quality of the food, the quality of the service, and the quality of the dining experience was eroding away. This erosion culminated with the brunch a group of friends and I endured this past Sunday. I say endured because our meal lasted from 12:30p.m. until 2p.m. The absurd elongation of our meal was not caused by entrancing, deep conversation amongst old friends, or by laggard mastication of our fantastic food. The epoch that was our brunch at Destihl was caused solely by the complete ineptitude and incompetence of our server, the manager, and Destihl as an establishment. To begin, our waiter spoke to our group at a volume slightly above \"whisper\". He seemed to not care at all that our decently sized group would likely give him his biggest tip of the day. One could almost assume our waiter was indentured to Destihl and taking our orders, suggesting menu items, and assuring that we were taken care of was a reminder of the chains that confined him. After taking our orders, three of which were simply \"eggs, bacon, and potatoes\" (not worth the $10), our group set off on the marathon that ninety minutes later would end in us getting our food. In total our group would watch at least seven other parties wait for a table, be placed near us, taken care of by the same subjugated waiter, eat, pay their bill, and depart. After the fourth group who had arrived after us was served before us, a member of our group called the manager over. At this point we had spent 45 minutes ordering and waiting. By this point the waiter had been unable to provide any information about our meal besides, \"they are still working on it, should be out soon.\" This information was decrypted by the members of our group through the reading of his lips and not by any sort of audible understanding between him and ourselves. We hoped the manger could provide us with additional information, this would prove to be a fool hearted assumption.The manager assured us he would check on our order and would return shortly. After three more groups consumed their meals, paid their tabs and departed, and another half an hour passed, the manager had not returned. At this point our group decided that if our food did not arrive by 1:45 PM. we would simply stand up, leave, and eat fast food. Finally, at 1:43p.m., 1 hour 13 minutes after arriving our meal was served. Destihl was relatively empty when we arrived and continued to be throughout our meal. Yet, our food took longer to cook than the run time of the original 1931 version of Frankenstein. If you have been to Destihl for brunch you know none of the menu items are difficult to cook, they are largely egg dishes accompanied by breakfast meats, french toasts, or a hot sandwich. Since this experience ended I have wondered what took so long for our food to be cooked and leave the kitchen. I have surmised that the reasons for our hour and a half endeavor are a product of the poor quality that now defines Destihl. First, our waiter did not care about us nor did he serve as our representative in the kitchen. Second, the cooks clearly lost track of our order because some food came out steaming hot, some came out only partially complete, and the rest came out lukewarm (presumably having spent an hour under a heat lamp). Finally, the manager who never returned to our table and only after being called over again offered excuse after excuse before finally saying, \"Well, I am sorry.\"To anyone who has invested the time to read my review, thank you. To anyone who has spent the time to read my review and still intends to go to Destihl even after I have made clear my utter frustration and disappointment, I wish you the best of luck. To conclude, my friends and I will never eat at Destihl again and I look forward to the restaurant that will soon replace it.",

We had to flag someone down just for some waters. I wouldn't say the servers did know what they were doing, but just very slow. For a Monday night, business was okay, but waiting 40 minutes for food is inexcusable. I had the Beer Battered Bacon Burger with an Egg, and it was below average. It would have been your average burger if the patty had any flavor.. But the meat was simply tasteless. The beer battered bacon is quite tasty, but the nothing I would crave for. The only reason I give this place two stars is for the Strawberry Ale that I got to try. The beer was light and smooth, it complimented my meal. I would go back to have a drink or two, but not for a dinner out with family or friends.",

It's delicious and beyond indulgent.I'm not a fan of their house brews, though. It seems like, regardless of style, most of them taste too much alike. I'm just not a fan of the brewmaster's style.",

There is also plenty of seating.For appetizers, we ordered the cheese curds, pretzel, and lamb meatballs. The cheese curds were amazing, basically just fried cheese with marinara sauce. The pretzel was also good - a little burnt in places but nothing too aggravating. It came with nacho cheese and mustard. Our server had the chef chop it up into bite size so we could share easily. Very thoughtful. For my lunch entree, I ordered the Dijon chicken. It came with two asparagus and mashed sweet potatoes with sausage chopped up in it. for about $10, i would order this over and over again. It truly felt like a hearty, but healthy lunch option, especially relative to other options on the menu. The price cannot be beat.",

                "review": "Overall, not impressed. My family decided to something a bit different this year and went to a new restaurant vs. going to old standbys. After finding a list of top restaurants online, we ended up settling on Destihl due to the large menu with seemingly lots of tasty options.We made a reservation for a Monday night and we were seated right away. Parking can be a bit difficult mid-evening. We had to circle around the nearby city lot to finally find a spot. My order: Chorizo stuffed dates to share and Thai steak salad.Other orders: Clam chowder (the soup of the day), House salad, Spicy Thai shrimp, and Pesto Chicken (recommended by the waiter).The dates came out first. I didn't realize they were going to be wrapped in bacon. But score, I love it that way. The bacon needed to be cooked a bit more though. They had a nice kick to them. They were enjoyed for the most part, but these are much better in Atlanta.As for main meal, the accidentally brought my mom a Caesar salad instead of the House salad. She was going to order it but changed her mind. The waiter forgot to write down the change. He came out quickly to apologize after it was delivered. The salad is a wedge salad with a crispy toast in place of croutons and a fried egg. My mom wasn't excited about the fried egg and gave it to us. I tasted it but didn't like it so passed it on to my brother. How do you mess up a fried egg?My Thai steak salad was not very good. The steak was cooked more medium than medium well. There was not much of it. The greens were kinda soggy. The peanuts were way too salty. Much better in Atlanta, again.Overall, portion sizes were adequate and we got our fill. We signed up for a rewards card that evening and were able to apply the purchase that we had just made to our rewards card. That was great. Even though I may not be back. There were plenty of other options that seemed great on the menu, but hesitant after this experience. Plus there are other places to try in the city.Everyone else liked their food. So that's something. I was going to give them 3 stars given everyone else's satisfaction. But then I realized that I had noted in our reservation that we were celebrating my dad's birthday. They didn't do anything to signify that. Not even a happy birthday. Nothing! So 2 stars it is.",

Like so good hat he went there for lunch and dinner one day and then came back for brunch the next morning. After looking at the menu, how could I resist??So we went today for a late lunch (around 2:30) and found the place pretty much deserted. There were some people working in the bar who made eye contact with us but didn't come up to the host stand to seat us. So we waited. And waited. And finally a hostess came and brought us to a cavernous booth in the bar. Where we waited. And waited. And listened to awful terrible music (read: Dave Matthews Band)A female server came to get our drink orders and informed us that Michael would be our server. Ok, so the do team service, I'm on board with that. But Michael didn't come with our drinks. Someone dressed like a manager did. And Michael didn't take our food order. A woman who we later learned was a manager did. I think Michael maybe refilled our drinks? The first manager looking guy dropped off our apps. Here's the skinny on what we had:Beer battered bacon: this is worth a star. It was greasy but oddly delicious. Brussels sprouts: flavor was good but they were still pretty hard in the middle. Bacon Egg and Cheese Deviled Eggs: nothing to write home about. They were small and pretty smoky tasting.  For entrees, I ordered the fried egg BLT and my sister ordered the bison burger. My BLT was fine. Again, nothing to write home about. There was some sort of mustardy vinaigrette on the greens that was overpowering. And the egg could have been runnier. But another star goes to the fries which were hot and crispy and delicious. My sister ordered her burger medium and it came out completely well done. Like \"we think this bison is dead but let's burn it at the stake just to make sure it's really really dead.\" She decided to send it back and so we waited. And waited. And a brand new server (still not Michael) came by to check on us. She went back to the kitchen to have them make a new burger and left the old one so my sis could nibble on the fries. Her friendly attitude and apologies would have garnered another star, but I was SO put off when she came back to tell us that her manager wanted to let us know that she put the order in correctly and that the cooks are the ones who screwed up. Umm... Why wouldn't the manager come over herself to apologize? Or at least to check on us after the replacement came? And also, it is so not cool to throw your kitchen staff under the bus like that. All in all, Destihl has good bacon, inattentive staff, poor leadership, and too much desire to be \"cool.\" And where is Michael? My receipt says he was my server but I don't even know if I saw him, and I fear my tip went to someone who didn't do any work! I won't be back.",

Omg, I just realized that delish is almost an anagram for Destihl.  So shall I say it was delisht*?Too many other things were off about the meal for me to want to return.  Too bad because those desserts sound alluring (pumpkin bread pudding!).- It took way too long for the waiter (who said he was new) to come back for our order.  Another waitress actually came by to ask how we were doing because she saw us looking around. - Long wait for the appetizers.  How long does it take to send over some cheese curds, bacon wrapped dates, and nachos?  The nachos arrived last.  I didn't time it, but the meal was a solid hour and 45 minutes.  I wasn't crazy about the nachos, but the cheese curds were my second fave after the dates.- My bison burger was extra dry (and I've had juicy bison before), and the bun it came on was too crumbly and dry as well.  I took 2 bites and ditched the rest of the bun.And the last and final straw:- My colleague clearly ordered the Carolina pork two ways (the entree is actually like 5 or 6 words on the menu, and he read off every word), but what was served to him was the Carolina wings.  He ended up just eating it because it would've taken forever for the correct entree to come out, based on our experience with the apps and entrees.  Also, rather than bringing out a free dessert or comp'ing the entree off the bill, we were still charged for the incorrect order, and waiter just kept saying thanks for understanding, and \"the wings tasting good?\"  That is actually the first time in life that I've seen an entree get messed up, and it's still charged on the final bill.  Wth?  I spoke to a manager, who removed the item from the bill.*the t is silent.  Duh!",

I also have a baby and a stroller and the host was great about getting her a high chair before we even asked, and was very chill about finding a place for the stroller and just having the baby around in general. The food was delicious. I had a Thai steak salad, and the steak came on its own next to the salad so you can cut it yourself and get the full delicious steak experience and not lose any juiciness. The steak was tender and cooked wonderfully, and the salad was nicely spicy, with some spicy peanuts that I think they make in-house. Good deal for $12, in my opinion, or at least not overpriced compared to restaurants with similar food. My husband had the fish and chips, which I thought were pretty nice too. Potato wedges were a bit salty, but I love salt, so I was happy. Beer-wise, I had a house IPA that was good but not great. Would go again for a nice meal out. It seems like a good place to go on a date or celebrate an event, and they seem to handle large groups well.",

They have few of the best appetizers I have had and certainly the best in the urbana-champaign area. They profess their best appetizer are the cheese curds (which are good) but the best of the lot has to be the Potato croquettes. I have had the beer-battered asparagus as well which changed my taste buds liking towards asparagus! I am a vegetarian and its extremely difficult to find a good vegetarian burger, so i was skeptical to order that (most places have burnt, bitter black bean patty!!) but they had one of the biggest veggie burger I have seen. The patty had rice, carrots, ginger and a few other veggies blended with the beans making it really delicious filling. The only vegetarian entree they have is the Stuffed Poblano Peppers, which was excellent. The staff is extremely courteous (sometimes more so than needed) and are very keen to entertain you. A few negatives are, the beer selection is great but is limited. I expect a brewery to have all their beers available (except the seasonal's, obviously) but they seem to rotate their beer. Even though the beer tastes good, I would cut some points for the spread of it. Another thing would be the place is unable to substitute any of the meat based dish with a vegetarian option which is a turn off if you are a vegetarian. P.S. Make a reservation, it is usually crowded!",

                "review": "If its TL;DR: Great food, great drinks, great service.I've gone to Desthil a few times, and I'm consistently impressed by their food and attention to detail.Once, I sat at the bar with my dad, just there for drinks; bartender was great, amiable and had suggestions when we knew what we liked and wanted recommendations. Their heffeweissen is really excellent. The apricot brew actually tastes like apricot; I tend to like fruity beers, and this one stood out to me. Their cocktails are also really, really good. I had the sake lemon drop and was not disappointed. Appetizers: Hands down, no contest, their beer-battered asparagus takes the gold. Its a lighter batter, more like a very gentle tempura than a \"fried chicken\" type fry. The honey-whatever sauce they serve with it is incredible, and they serve a grilled lemon with it that you probably aren't supposed to eat but tastes like candy so do it anyways. The shrimp ceviche is nothing to write home about. The shrimp skewers entree was tasty and well seasoned, but if you came with a big appetite, it might not be the choice for you. Their portions (one of the things I like most about Desthil) are reasonable and not out of this world for most of the main dishes. My boyfriend wasn't totally full when he left, but comfortable. The thai steak salad is incredible! I like a little spice, and this definitely had that! It's not big, but its delicious. Their pizzas are also fabulous, if a little salty. You can't complain that they underseason like some places in downtown Champaign. The seabass dish (I think it was a special) was definitely worth it. They do their cubans right; their mustard is homemade I think and really rounds it out. Overall, loved it. Decently priced for what you get, and you get a great night out!",

                "review": "This is become one of my favorite places to dine in Champaign. Good prices, consistent cooking, good service, and not too busy on Sunday mornings. I noticed some people complained about the prices, but for the quality of food, this is really much cheaper than something comparable in the Chicago suburbs although the portions aren't exactly huge. But it's pretty in line with prices and portion sizes at other restaurants in downtown. The menu is quite unique for the area and similar to what you'd find in a lot of Milwaukee restaurants.I really enjoyed everything from the American Kobe burger to the Beer-battered cod. The textures and variety of flavors were great and not too salty. The sandwiches and soups were also pretty light and refreshing. I particularly enjoyed the tomato soup and corn & chicken chowder soups. The dessert choices were quite varied but i was so full I didn't have room for more than one. The stout ice cream sandwiches had a really nice stout ice cream between brownie circles. It was a perfect way to end the meal.Given the quality of cooking and good prices, I'll definitely be back here soon.Update: Upon visiting a few more times, I still think this is a good restaurants but there are a couple notes.The price complaints I see from some reviews may be due to the varying sizes of some dishes. For example, the thai mussels appetizer is quite a bit smaller than some other items although the prices are similar. Also, the chocolate cake is a giant portion compared to the bread pudding.I'm not a big fan of anything Asian themed I tried here as I found the flavors to be too strong. I prefer it to be more delicate although some patrons may appreciate the bold flavors. I wasn't a big fan of the pizzas either. They were large in size but the dough was too moist for me and I didn't like the flavor combinations I tried.I did like the teas I tried as they were high quality organic tea bags. The coffee is a mix of two Kenyan coffees with a full bodied flavor from their supplier in Bloomington served with fresh cream. The shrimp frittata comes with a generous amount of shrimp flavored with shrimp stock, probably the best frittata I've ever eaten. The cuban style pork sandwich was done well but not as legendary as other reviewers make it out to be. The Potts roast was also done well but not worth a special note. The potato crusted rainbow trout was done well with good presentation but I wish the portion size could have been a little larger. The dijon chicken was moist and flavored well but, the real star of the dish was the asparagus that was cooked and flavored excellently.The apple fritters dessert had crispy fritters but the toughness of the peel wasn't that appealing. If it were substituted with something like apple chips or churros, I probably would have enjoyed it more. If the goal is to keep an apple-like look, possibly fried colored dough is a better substitute. The chocolate cake is a whole pound with chocolate layering instead of cream. This was done well and not overly sweet, a very good choice for chocolate lovers.  The sour cherry bread pudding was done well, a little too sour for me but a solid choice. I would've preferred a couple elements to vary the texture inside but that might not fit the overall theme of the dish.",

Not only were we waiting 30 minutes, four parties similar in size were seated within 5 minutes.  She was rude and if she were our only interaction with the restaurant, I'd never want to come back.The food was not bad, the ancho chip crusted pork loin was huge and delicious, fish and chips had a great batter on it, both top notch. However, the spicy chipotle chicken sandwiches was well seasoned, but could use a little more substance than just chicken and arugula.  There was too much bread for the sandwich. As for sides, the potato wedges were not bad, french fries were soggy and floppy.Four stars for the food, three for the hostess.",

Maybe it iwas the fact that we checked it out 4 days after it opened, but of the 5 beer styles we got, 4 of them were \"off\".  One was clearly oxidized (badly), one was infected to lacto and tasted very funy and the other two mildly oxidized.  We hoped the manager would come visit with us, but no luck.  The bartender indicated that depending on the time of day, the beer tastes different from the yeast.  First time I have heard of that.  Food was decent, but I have had better pub grub.  Maybe the beer just ruined my taste buds.  (Positive) The pizza is HUGE .  .enough for two to share or one very hungry person.Hopefully they figure things out.  Have been frequently brewpubs throughout the US in the last 12 years and can honestly say it was the oxidized beer and infect beer were the worse I have ever had.  Even my earliest botched homebrews were not that \"off\".  Gave it two stars since it was the first week it was open and the possibilities it was growing pains.",

Our booth was large and comfy.  Our waiter was knowledgeable and just friendly enough.  Can quickly become pricey if you stay a while and dive into the small plates and drinks.I was overwhelmed by the drink menu and ended up going with my old standby, the dirty Martini.  My first one with organic corn vodka, which made for a smooth sipping drink.  Loved it.  J tried two different drinks (so I got to try them too) over the course of our dinner, both of which were delicious and pleasantly spiked with liquor.We tried two different apps - the Beer Battered Bacon and the House Olives (our 2nd choice when we were told they'd just run out of the deviled eggs).  The bacon was not greasy at all, and the maple chipotle drizzle was the perfect topper.  The olives were meh, just not necessary - and I don't think my opinion was swayed too much by the fact that I really, really wanted those deviled eggs!Next up, a la carte soup.  I went with the Beer & Cheddar soup, which was close to great with discernible beer and cheese flavors.  J chose the soup du jour, Cream of Asparagus - excellent fresh asparagus flavor here.  Both soups were wonderfully creamy.  Bowls were decent-sized for $5.My entree was a Thai shrimp and noodle dish (I'm a sucker for coconut curry sauces).  Nice amount of shrimp, but no noticeable spice to the dish.  A bit of a disappointment.  J's beer-brined double pork chop was an amazing dish, not to mention huge.

Maybe I just know how to order at a place like this (potato croquettes are great, pretzels are... pretzels - come on, cheese curds are okay, sandwiches are satisfying). I feel like if you're ordering something that you expect to be high-end here, you're just begging to be disappointed. Very good cocktail menu. Nice that they will fill growlers. More than likely there's something on tap you'll like. Good spot to come after work.I always sit at the bar and I usually see people all around who seem happy - that tends to be a good sign in my book.",

It's often the gathering point for business events or company dinners, which brings a lot of patrons to this restaurant. There's a good selection of beer that's, judging by the brewing equipment in the restaurant, presumably brewed in-house (and maybe some off-site) as well as a decent menu showcasing modern American fare.  Usually, a drinking establishment that decides to start cooking ends up making subpar food, while a restaurant that makes good food has a lackluster beer selection. Of course, this isn't always the case, but I usually don't go to bars for their food, and restaurants for their beer. Destihl, however, strikes a good balance between the two camps.  I had a chicken pot pie when I went there, while my dining companion had stuffed peppers. Both were perfectly fine, but nothing to write home about. The menu is made up of conventional American dishes, but unfortunately nothing too unique. You'll find everything you want here for a great meal, but nothing that truly catches your eye.  Overall, the service was excellent, our waiter had insightful knowledge on the beer selections, and the atmosphere here was just right. I feel like their menu is a bit too unoriginal to justify the price, but regardless, I'm sure you'll enjoy your meal here anyways.",

Luckily for me I had not been highly anticipating the opening of Destihl. The beers were good enough. There were about a dozen to choose from so if you drink beer at all, you should be able to find one you like. The night we went in we were given free 2oz samples of as many of the beers  as we wanted to try. I tried the Belgian, Strawberry Blonde and Raspberry Wheat, Champaign Blond and Frankengluten - good flavors, but none will be appearing on my all-time favorites list. The Frankengluten was interesting and worth a try if you are adventurous. Our waiter was nice and attentive enough but could not properly give drink recommendations since he was not old enough to drink. I thought this strange since, clearly, patrons are going to want to know about the beer. The food... I had the brie and portabello sandwich with chips. The chips were average and the sandwich was bland. That's honestly about the best I can say. My dinner partner said his steak salad was excellent and it looked fresh and crisp, but I can't vouch for the taste. We split the beer battered asparagus and that was by far my favorite item. I will probably go back at some point for another try. The pizza and a desserts sounded like they may have potential.Second visit 8/27/11: Finally tried the pizza (pesto and goat cheese) and still really no change in my review. Nice wait staff but the food does not overly impress. You do receive a large quantity of food for the price. Although, for me, quantity does not trump quality.",

Service was very slow, but since it's the first weekend of operation, I'm not going to take any points off. The decor was really nice, cosy, and even a little cosmopolitan. I got the pesto chicken pasta which I thought was good, but nothing to get excited about. I tried the fried cheese appertiser, and while good, they also weren't anything to write home about. Overall, food was good, but not great. There are better restaurants elsewhere.The drinks, on the other hand, were good AND also reasonably priced which I did not expect. They had a big beer, wine, cocktail, and martini menu. I tried a couple of different beers, and they were all really good for the most part. They also had 4 oz portion which was a great way to try different beers, and the 4 oz portion is surprisingly not priced proportionally any higher than its 12 oz counter part. Destihl seems like the ideal place to get dinner before a night downtown. Great ambient, great location, great drinks, and good food. Even though it's not anywhere near there yet, I'm sure that it has the potential to be the best place in a couple of months.",

We asked the waitress if there was some mistake but she confirmed that, indeed the bun we received was the \"golden brioche bun\". Either the waitress was mistaken, or this restaurant does not know what a brioche bun is. I guess it's also possible that I have no idea what a brioche bun should look like. I uploaded a photo of the bun if you guys want to see for yourself.",

They're not quite there yet, BUT this four stars is partially based on potential. I don't know if that's acceptable for Yelp, but whatever.I will admit I got a little gluttonous this evening. Ideally, I wouldn't have eaten as much as I did, but it was what it was. I started off with some of the home brews. I did the the little 4 oz guys and out of the four I tried, I liked three enough to drink again (the Belgian ale was a bit too hoppy for my liking). At $1.25 each (or $5 for the 4), I don't mind one I didn't like.Next I went with the beer-cheese soup. WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT. It was amazingly good. Also, at my table were some cheese curds and I will dare say that these curds were the finest curds I have ever eaten (and I've had them in Wisconsin too). For my entree, I went with the bison burger which was flavorful - although I will echo the review who noted that their meat was overcooked - and I appreciated that fries were included. The fries were awesome - shoestring style and were not oversalted, but weren't seasoned improperly either (just right!).For dessert it was baked apples with butter pecan ice cream. It was wildly decadent and irresponsibly delicious. The service is not awful but you can tell that the servers are still getting their feet wet. No worries though. The food was totes worth the wait. I'll be back no doubt and I'm pretty sure I'll be updating with 5 stars.",

Why can't the 4th largest city in the US have a brewpub? I digress.There is a sterile and industrial atmosphere here. One that I am seeing in more in more bars, and I am not a fan. The style does not work here looks like the pub and owners are being cheep.  Seems cold to me. The bar is to the left with some tables and booths. To the right on the Neil St side is another dinning area. The brewing equipment can be seen from the Church St side. A few TV's above the bar, but unintrusive. Relaxed, but sterile and pretty much the exact opposite of the Blind Pig. Which oozes uniqueness from every wood poor.The service is fast, but they are not very interested in much. I want someone working at a brewpub to at least show interest in their products. Here it seems they want to shuffle you in and out with a ticket and some tips. Unimpressed on this front. The food is fairly bland and generic. Some pizzas, some steaks, some chicken, some seafood. A little of everything. They do nothing good, but nothing bad either.There is a wide variety of beers available. Including a cask mild, which I would have jumped at if I had seen it before leaving. The rest is about 14 taps in all styles. A blonde, hefeweizen, a scotch ale, a few stouts and IPAs (some imperial), lots of Belgian styles.  Though nothing is really that good, and some have obvious flaws.Overall, clearly the second best brewpub on the block. Almost the definition of average to me. The food does not really excite me either. I really can't see myself coming here to often over the many other great beer destinations and restaurants within walking distance. Though cheers for at least another brewpub option in town.",

In my experience, I will sacrifice dim lighting for a chile that is actually spicy.  Oh, midwestern restaurants.  Are you using bell peppers to make Chile Rellenos?

For dinner I had the Swordfish dinner. It has a very nice and spicy glaze and is served on a bed of arugula and other spiced veggies. Very impressive, very tasty, but it was a little small which the server told me ahead of time. Not the best choice if you are looking for a big meal, but a very good dish overall. My friend had the Pork rib and pulled pork dish with cole slaw and potatoes. I was very good, had a nice kick to it. Everything is served with a modern flair and a unique flavor profile. This is not your typical boring brew pub food. Very stylish. The atmosphere is nicer that most brew pubs and is great for a nice dinner out with friends. I am never disappointed at Destihl!!",

Tons of good things to say about the place, but I'll start with the two negatives so we can get that out of the way.The waitress heard me say cheese pizza instead of goat cheese pizza.  Probably my fault actually, because it was loud and I am a self-proclaimed mumbler.  This mistake was fixed promptly and the pesto goat cheese pizza was awesome.  Second problem was that the fried asparagus was somewhat whelming.  It was really big, so if you're going for size great, but smaller spears aren't woody textured like the big spears.  I assume that since they specify they use local when they can, that this problem will remedy itself once asparagus comes into season in a few weeks around here.Now for the mega good stuff:Deadhead double red is probably THE BEST red ale I've ever had.  It is strong, spicy, flavorful and full bodied.  Just wonderful!  Everyone at my table liked their other flavors (and we went with some beer snobs ;)  The hubby loved, loved, loved the coffee glazed rib-eye.  Service was surprisingly good granted that it was the first weekend they were open.  The people getting bad service in the other review...sorry, we must've been hogging all the attention ;).  We actually liked the place so much we went back for brunch on the next day.  Which was even. more. amazing.Ordered the swordfish tacos (see pics) and Cuban sandwich, and the french toast (see pics) for the munchkin.  The kids French toast was ridiculously awesome.  Here's the most awesome kicker- we were with a big group with 4 kids and the back room was open, so they gave it to us to have our brunch back there so the kids wouldn't bother anyone else.  It was an awesome experience and the whole staff was soooo super nice.  Make sure to check out my food pics- the kids meal was 1/3 eaten when I took the pic, but you can imagine the thrill in junior's eyes when he saw what he got for breakfast! :)Awesome place guys!  Keep up the good work!",

Fortunately, I was able to get a reservation through OpenTable via Yelp, so getting in was no problem.When we arrived, we were seated within 30 seconds.  I appreciate that efficiency - we also saw several groups that tried the walk-in route - Lesson Learned - use the Yelp reservation system for fast seating!We ordered the home-made chips for an appetizer, and they were great.  Very tasty, and a malt vinegar sauce, as well as a spicy sauce.This place makes and serves it's own beer.  if you want a Bud Light, you'll have to go elsewhere.  If you want to try their beer, the prices are quite honestly, very low for good beer.  We tried their 4 ounce beers (I know, so small, but since you're trying a store brew, do I really want 16 ounces I don't like after one sip?) and for $1 and $1.50 (the price range of a 4 ounce beer), we got 2 beers that were very palatable and very good.On to dinner. The menu ranges from sandwiches to steaks to pizza.I ordered the 8 ounce Sirloin, medium rare.  The steak was cooked properly, more importantly, it was seasoned properly, and tasted great.  It was more tender than some fillets I have had recently.  A+!My wife ordered a pork roast dish, that had pork so tender you didn't need a knife.  She really liked the dish.My daughter went with the 8 ounce burger, and was very impressed.  She ordered it medium rare, and it was cooked to order.  She loved it.My son ordered one of the pizzas, and was a little surprised when a large, thin crust pizza arrived (pleasantly surprised - he was expecting a lot less.)  The pizza was great.We ordered desert, which included carrot cake (we ordered 1 piece for 2 people, and it was the right choice - very heavy, very good), along with S'mores and a Neopolitan fruit dish, all of which were very good.The only reason this isn't getting 5 stars is the noise level - the interior is nicely appointed, and very well done, but the acoustics are not very good.  Lots of hard surfaces result in a loud restaurant, where it was hard to hear our server.We'll be back.  The entire ticket with tip was less than $110 for four adults.",

I went it's opening weekend and let me be clear when I say this rating is based on beers alone, I didn't get a chance to try the food yet!I'll start by saying that the atmosphere is really cool. It reminds me of a Blind Pig Brewery meets Seven Saints or something like that. They call themselves a gastro-brewery instead of a gastro-pub, which I think fits the bill pretty well. The place is divided up nicely with the bar being it's own area and a nicer looking restaurant on the other side. I have to say though, I was a bit surprised to hear that it's only open until 11, that doesn't seem wise for an area of town that's so reliant on the nightlife.As far as the beer goes, they had 18 on tap that were freshly made on the spot and they were pretty amazing. I was surprised to hear that they didn't have anything but their own brews available, and I worried about how my non-fancy beer fans felt, but then when I tasted their Champaign Blonde Ale, it was EXACTLY like a Bud Light. I think my favorite that I sampled was the Downstate Pale Ale, and the Raspberry Wheat Ale was a bit too much for me. But overall, I think they covered their bases pretty well.I definitely can't wait to come back and try the food (which I hear is truuuuly delicious) and give this place it's 5th and final star!UPDATE!So I went back and finally got to try the food. I believe I ordered the Swordfish, my boyfriend got the jambalaya and we both split some of the beer battered asparagus. I'll say right away the asparagus was the best part, which didn't surprise me because everyone raved about their appetizers, but I never heard much about the main dishes. My swordfish wasn't that great, to be honest, and I'm pretty easy to please. My boyfriend's jambalaya wasn't superb either, but then again, that's probably not the best thing to order at a place like this.All in all, everything was good, and a nice change from what's available downtown, but if I had one piece of advice, it would be stick to the beer and small plates!",

If eating at the bar, the servers are very attentive. If eating at a table, it's the same as well. If you can eat on the patio, do it. The menu is extensive and has a great variety-- whether you're looking for sandwich/burger or a full entree. Everything I've tried so far has been great. They also have awesome beers. They brew sour beers, which I had never tried until I came here. Overall, great place to go no matter what you're looking for! Try the salmon and the cheese curds!",

Over all, I found the flavors in each dish are well balanced and don't compete for attention.

The service staff knowledgeable and attentive.  I wish I had one where I live and will absolutely be back when I find myself in Champaign again.",

Most of the food is very good, better conceived and made than a lot of other area restaurants offer. Portions are fairly generous (not so much with brunch items), and the price fits the quality of ingredients and preparation. The staffing is good, service is timely, and the decor is charming. The craft beers made on site are wonderful. Try a series of 4 ouncers to build your own tasting. The flavor profiles given on the brew menu seem so far to have been accurate.For appetizers, I recommend the shrimp ceviche (technically a \"small plate\") and the stone oven pretzels (you get two, with cheese and spicy honey mustard dips). I've tried one soup, the corn and chicken chowder, which was very good, nice SW pepper flavor without overwhelming the chicken. We've had sandwiches and entrees, from burgers to steak, and it's all been really delicious. The food is in the American Contemporary Casual style -- better than Houlihan's at the i-Hotel in our opinion.The only bad experience we've had with the food has been the cedar plank brie dessert. It was badly prepared (the brie wasn't even room temperature) and either the recipe was off or the honey-chili sauce was made incorrectly, because it was completely unbalanced and unpalatable. The smoke flavor reacted poorly with what was on the plank, too. We took the brie home (a big piece) and cut off the rind to eat the middle later, but it still tasted of rank sauce and smoke. We did not go back to the restaurant for a couple of months because of just how bad this was.  I wrote the general manager and he was good about it, offering to review the recipe and preparation with the lead chef. Since returning to Destihl, we've had good experiences again -- the place is consistent, a fun place to socialize, and a nice addition to CU's restaurant scene.",

Not one of the entrees are even vegetarian (they have a few vegetarian burgers and such, however). They have exactly one vegan dish: vegetables cooked in cashew cream. That's all folks. The dish was distinctly unremarkable, but most of the menu appears that way (this applies to even the animal products dishes; Destihl is only good for a select few dishes: salmon, mac and cheese, and burgers). I also ordered potato croquettes because from the description, there's no cheese in it (the other descriptions listed cheese, so I mistakenly assumed that these were cheese-free). In fact, the potato croquettes do have cheese in them. Just a note.I can't give 5 stars to a restaurant that I don't personally enjoy. But I think if you like beer and American food, you'd like this place.Just a note: I received a Compliment from another Yelper who seems to have misinterpreted my review. I would never take stars off because a restaurant is not vegan friendly especially when it never claimed to be. If you read my review, you can see my comments on the taste of the food. I even specifically wrote that my criticisms applied to animal product dishes LOL! I have tried many, many dishes at Destihl, both vegan and non-vegan. Destihl is two stars because the food is poor, not because it's not vegan (I almost want to laugh writing this because I can't believe someone would actually gloss over my whole review just to leave me a negative comment. It's pretty funny how willfully thick people insist on being). Yes, at one point I hated Destihl but I grew to love it...but that was because I was settling and I was naive. After trying many other restaurants, my opinion is that Destihl, overall, is an average to below average restaurant that may appeal to some people. I write about both sides to help veg*ns make eating out choices. They are never reasons to take stars off. I even explicitly noted which meat and cheese dishes were good so that I could highlight the good stuff about Destihl. People are really funny. This Yelper also asked me why I don't just exclusively visit vegan restaurants (even if you're not vegan, I think you can see how funny this comment is). Cheers.",

Well, anything is possible it was a tarter beer but still a very light ale. They didn't have their dunkelweizen here which was disappointing. I got hungry waiting for my friend so I ordered the Ancho chips and dip. The chips were just okay but the vinegar and the dressings were really quite good. The habanero vinegar wasn't overpoweringly hot but had a nice kick and the ranch was more than just a ranch dressing. I had the bison burger because I haven't had bison meat in a while and it was just as good. The burger though, was all right the bison, slightly sweeter and less greasy than ground beef was good. The dressing on it though took away from the flavor of the meat  but the fries were actually quite tasty.  Overall, it's still an okay place",

I had the Cuban sandwich and one of the better Cubans I've had in a long time!  My wife and friend both had a pasta dish which they enjoyed.  The waiter also was very knowledgeable about the menu and large number of beer choices, all of which were excellent too.  There are lots of choices in Champaign and I recommend anyone try Distihl!",

The food is okay, I can't say that it is amazing or that I crave coming here for dinner. It is also not cheap by any imagination, but this is one of the hot spots for dinner with the gastropub concept and microbrewery on site. The first time I came during a work function. I had the bavarian style pretzel. Nothing really exciting. Pretzel with cheese sauce or the IPA mustard. It sort of reminded me of the pretzels you would get at the amusement park. I ended up trying the most expensive item on the menu which was the espresso rubber ribeye 18 oz with bone in, chiptole espress bbq sauce, asparagus, and bacon truffle mashed potatoes for 30 dollars. Somehow the meat just does not match steak hour quality meat. You are expecting an angus quality steak, but somehow my ribeye had a huge chunk of fat in the middle. Good ribeye is marbled with fat to give it that amazing tenderness and flavor, this was not that. The espresso rubbed gave it sort of a burnt flavor. I can't say that I was impressed. The second time I came went with the beer battered bacon egg burger 14.50 that had angus beef, beer battered jalapeno bacon, bacon jam, along with a fried egg topped with smoked white cheddar cheese and a brioche bun. Somehow the batter of the bacon was super thick so you ended up having chicken tender size bacon on top of the burger. The blend of angus beef patty with bacon jam and fried egg is an amazing combo, but somehow the oil must have not been changed for the beer batter bacon. It was a very dark color and had a strong not so pleasant oil taste. If you like gastro-pub food you can give this place a try, but once again for the price you pay the food just falls short of that bar.Pros: gastro-pub, lots of beer selection, quick serviceCons: not top quality protein, the oil may have not been changed for a while given the overused oil taste, expensiveHidden deals:Join the desthil guest reward program. I did not get offered this at my visit.You get 25 dollars back after spending 500 dollars. Double points at lunch time during the week.",

We were promptly escorted to a roomy booth which really worked out because other people ended up joining us. We had to wait for a while for the other people to show up and the staff was very amenable to it, acted like that was just fine. They even held back our entree order until they got there.We liked the deviled eggs for the appetizer, they were really good. I had the chili which was very disappointing, I wouldn't get it again.

I also recommend the herbivore burger if you like veggie burgers. It is huge though so be prepared to share with someone or take half home. The cedar plank salmon is also very good and comes with grilled vegetables and a nice arugula salad. The salad was a bit too overdressed for my taste so request it to be lightly dressed if you don't like a lot of dressing.As far as dessert goes I've tried the cherry bread pudding, s'mores, chocolate cake, and the wild sour berry tart and out of all of those I would recommend the tart and the chocolate cake. They give you a pound of chocolate cake so only order it if you are not already stuffed from your meal or if you want to take it home. Half of it was more than enough for 4 of us.",

The burger is bland and if you're lucky (note my sarcasm), you'll get a few nice, chewy chunks of fat in there. I got some kind of s'mores dessert and it was a cheap mess. How can you make a bad s'mores dessert??? It's cruel! Their menu is so awesome, but they're SUCH a tease! They cannot execute anything well. I gave them two stars: one, for the selection in the menu and the other, because I haven't had any beer here and it is kind of a brewery I guess so I can't judge them there.

My husband and I have been here a few times, and we both really like the potato croquettes (mmm, chimichurri) and the marinated cucumber salad. Both have a spicy bite -- definitely recommended. The rest of the food is okay. Pizzas are decent, the salads seem to rely a lot on the dressings, similarly so with the sandwiches. Service is good and friendly, although can come down a little on the overwhelmingly chatty side. Still, in a place as big as this one, it's nice to not feel like you've gotten lost or abandoned.Unfortunately, I can't recommend much else. The design and marketing of Destihl gives off a very artisanal vibe, particularly in their choice of \"craft beer,\" but their beers are at best uneven and at worst anemic shadows of what they could be. Most recently, I was disappointed in the pumpkin porter, which sounds like it should be layered and spicy and complex. Mostly, it was bitter and I could only taste the pumpkin if I really thought about it. I've felt similarly about all of their beers that I have tried, although a few are okay (the Hefeweizen, the Tripel). I want to be seduced by the delicious descriptions (and oh, they DO have a good writer), but I just can't.This place reads to me as a large chain that wants to be a small, careful, art-and-ingredient-driven restaurant, but it doesn't get there. It's confusing. 2 1/2 stars, rounding down.",

The food has been sensational, but they tend to overseason some dishes. Several people in our party ordered Caesar salads (which is half a head of romaine topped with a fried egg) and they were grossly over peppered. The pulled pork from my Carolina pork two ways was the spiciest pulled pork I've ever tasted in my life, so much so that I couldn't take more than two bites in a row. It wasn't a problem ubiquitous throughout our group or between visits, though.The atmosphere is very nice. It's dark and clean. The service has always been good.",

The fish tacos we had were phenomenal and the beer was quite tasty as well, however the fact that we had to wait so long for absolutely everything took my rating of them down a star.  They weren't busy, so I don't know what the hold up was.",

The drafts come in three sizes, which is really nice. My friends and I got the pretzels with cheese and mustard dipping sauces, and LOVED them. I got the bison burger with fries and had to stop myself from eating the whole thing before my stomach exploded! Great wait staff and a very classy atmosphere.Visit #2: Another great beer experience. Got a pizza this time, which was pleasantly adequate for a one person dinner. It was thin and crispy, but not crunchy...just the way I like it! We sat at a window near the bar and watched downtown during sunset, which was really nice. I like the corner location...lots of natural light!Will definitely consider coming here whenever I want to eat downtown. Reasonably priced for the quality, and a great overall dining experience.",

We were impressed with ALL of it.  Flat bread was good if you're in the mood for starchy foods--the pizza had a very thin crust, which I loved, so you could eat more of the toppings...and the salad was HUGE for its small price.We tasted several of the beers and ended up getting a growler to go because we loved it so much.Decor was a bit industrial, and very contemporary, especially for the Midwest.  We will definitely return and bring friends!",

Honestly, my biggest pet peeve with Destihl is their attempt at trying to create elevated food that just come off as tacky. For instance when I split their quesadilla appetizer they proudly touted it was deconstructed. That meant the appetizer consisted of some tortillas with melted cheese and a side of so-so grilled steak. Give me a break- I've had some cleverly deconstructed items before and that was not the case here. They do a similar thing with smores (e.g. the marshmallows come pre-melted). Tacky might be a strong word but to serve things in ways that are poorly executed and actually make eating your meal less enjoyable and more complicated in an attempt to seem high-end is pretty tacky.",

I personally love the beer-battered asparagus and beer-battered fish and chips. My husband has ordered the fish tacos on one occasion and pizza on another. The fish tacos were okay. The pizza is good. They also have a gluten-free menu and a kids' menu. Even though we have never taken our 2.5 year old to a kids' restaurant, and she is used to dining with grown-ups in grown-up restaurants, it's nice that they accommodate young diners with crayons to color on the kids' menu. Even the most patient young foodie could use a quiet distraction while they wait. Glad we have this restaurant in the C-U. I highly recommend it.",

It took less than 5 minutes to get seated and less than 10 minutes to have our order taken. Within 2 minutes of having our order taken, the soup we ordered came out. The main entree came out in a timely fashion as well.Items I ordered were:Three Cheese & Ale SoupStuffed Poblano PepperCajun-Style Shrimp Po' BoyThe soup was overall very delicious. It was a bit salty but the creamy consistency was amazing and the bacon and green onions really gave the dish some nice texture and crunch. The soup also had a slight bitterness which was good as well. I highly recommend this dish. The stuffed pepper had great flavor but lacked texture. The potato and cheese filling was a bit mushy and the pepper being mushy as well didn't help. I wish the pepper had a bit more crunchy texture to accompany the creaminess of the potato and cheese. The sauce was great and had a nice flavor with some heat. The rice and corn was delicious as well. I probably wouldn't recommend this dish. The po' boy was pretty good. The bread was toasted well and gave the sandwich a nice crunch. Shrimp was a bit overcooked and the veggies were kind of just slammed together in some sauce. However, flavor was there. I took a risk in ordering a Louisiana style dish here and it didn't really hit the mark. I would still recommend this dish nonetheless. I was going to give this place 3 stars but the service is what made this place shine. Therefore, 4 stars it is! Overall, not a bad experience and would come back.",

There was not much of the cheese sauce that was supposed to be on the sandwich, either.  Did it taste good?  Sure, when I managed to get a bite that actually had all the ingredients of the sandwich in it.  Also, the top piece of bread was hard, probably because it'd been under the warmer for a while.I feel like they charge high prices for mediocre food; I do like having a spendy meal every now and then, but Destihl is not where I would go when I do.",

It was fairly fast service as well for being as many of us as there were.  I liked the menu selection here to.  Lots of gourmet and different food items to choose from, not the same old stuff you see at most restaurants.  They have a unique twist to your average or popular dishes.  Pretty cool.Now on to the food.... They had me at beer battered jalapeo bacon! Omg it was delicious! We also tried the beer battered asparagus which was equally as good.  For my meal I got the green chile mac and cheese with pork.  It was good, I wish I would've ordered something with a bit more substance (not much meat in it) but I guess that was my own fault! The flavor of what I had was great though.  I also tried my moms stuffed pablano pepper which was great! I wish I would've gotten that.  Everyone seemed to love their food here.  Oh, and the carrot cake is TO DIE FOR! I highly recommend it, the pieces are as big, if not bigger, than my head! The prices were also fair.  I really enjoyed this place!

                "review": "Destihl (a play on De Stijl? no idea) is an inconsistently passable restaurant with a nice line of beers. They're also a brewery, if you're into that sort of thing, and my experience has been that the waitstaff are very helpful and knowledgeable when it comes to the stuff on tap.So if you like the idea of a flight of carefully-selected brews and tasty (if not slightly overpriced) appetizers appeals, stop by.Don't bother with sitting down for dinner. I've limped out of dinner here maybe five times in the past several years. Some reviewers described the food as 'delicious' (they are wrong); a few others as 'inconsistent' or 'not great' (correct). As a purveyor of hastily-prepared American slow food, Destihl is unremarkable, and the breadth of their menu probably suffices to describe the care that each dish has received. Some dishes are actually quite nice, if still too expensive, but you're unlikely to know which are worth your time unless you've got a secret decoder ring or something.If you're looking to blow some cash on food downtown, think about what kind of food you really want. You're likely to get the same (or a similar) dish done better somewhere else. It's like a rich man's Applebees -- the food is better dressed and the ambience is less \"shopping mall,\" but your wallet hurts more than it should and your tongue is left just as wanting.Oh, and if you ignore the rest of my advice, don't ignore this: don't get the big chocolate cake for dessert. It is the most over-sized lump of grocery store crap I've ever tasted. Its spot on the dessert menu is downright insulting.",

She indicated that our waitress had revealed our past unhappy experience and wanted to make sure we were ok and appreciated that we had come back. Needles to say I was very surprised. Props to the waitress for not only remembering but acknowledging our prior discontent. We were given a comp card and apologized for the past fumble. I appreciated it.

I had dijon chicken the last time I was there and it was burnt and over cooked but the sides were underdone. My boyfriend got a steak which came out a bit too rare and was just a bad cut- riddled with lines of fat.

It has become the go-to place whenever my parents visit (I am in law school).The first time we went there, I was pleasantly surprised to see how many options were available for myself because I am an ovo-lacto vegetarian.  Usually I have to settle for something bland or uninteresting, but Destihl has lots of imaginative and delicious options.  We started with the beer-battered asparagus which was pretty tasty.  I ordered the stuffed pablano which was absolutely amazing.  It was spicy and had a really interesting mix of flavors.  My mom got the Thai fried chicken and my dad got the ribeye, which they both loved.  My boyfriend got the bison burger which he thought was good but not as amazing as our dishes.  The second time we went was for lunch.  I got the lunch combo with the portabella and brie sandwich and the beer and cheddar soup.  The sandwich was yummy but the soup was really very delicious.  Definitely comfort food and really hit the spot.  My mom got the Thai fried chicken again and my dad got the Thai steak which he said was even better than the ribeye.  My boyfriend ordered the Dijon chicken which he really enjoyed.You should probably make a reservation for dinner but likely do not need one for lunch.  They also serve brunch on the weekends until 2:00 and those items looked pretty delicious as well.  We have had great servers at Destihl and the restaurant has a nice ambiance.  Plus, they don't have a corkage fee!  The first time we went, we brought our own bottle of wine and there was no charge!  All in all we have had really great meals here and will definitely be returning!",

The beer selection was OK, but nothing stellar - and one of the beers I got was on the warm side. The ambiance was nice, and it was quiet enough to make it easy to talk with the rest of the table, even though a world series game was on and it was pretty crowded. The food was just mediocre. The fries (which were recommended as a side) were tasty, but a bit soggy. I had a chicken sandwich that was tasty, but the amount of meat was pretty small - it was a thin cut (probably half a breast pounded flat) and I ended up peeling away half the bun, which was twice as big as the cut.My friends seemed to like their food (burger, bacon-wrapped dates), but I don't think they would give it more than 2.5 or 3 stars either. I gave it 3 stars because the prices were OK, but I'm used to California prices - so this might be more the norm for Champaign.",

A brew-pub has to have great beer-cheese soup, right?  WRONG!!!!  The soup was like a creamy caraway broth with some green onion garnish.  No taste of cheese or beer, just gross.  The Pastrami Reuben, described as served on Cranberry Nut bread, looked interesting on the menu.  However, what I received was essentially a large cranberry nut scone (about 4\" tall) sliced in half with three small pieces of pastrami, a few shreds of sauerkraut, and invisible swiss cheese.  I normally do not send things back in a restaurant, but this showing was so horrible, I sent it back.  I tried the $13 American Kobe burger instead.  Eh.  It was an average - but by no means worth $13 - burger (think akin to the pre-made patties you find at Sam's Club) and, once again, the bread-to-meat ratio was WAY off.   Anyway, $40 later, we walked out very disappointed.  I can think of several places in town I could go and spend much less for a much higher quality experience.",

I went with the Potato Crusted Rainbow Trout.  It had wonderful flavor!  My co-worker got my usual and she loved them too.  We decided to go for dessert as well.  I ordered the Creme Brulee.

It was a MUCH bigger place than I anticipated, and I would love to see it on a day when it was busy. We were there about 3pm on a Monday. I was immediately impressed with the vibe of the place - very hip, and something you would expect to find in any major city's downtown. The beer list was posted on a board above the bar and was HUGE for a local microbrewery. Where I expected to find 8-10 local beers supported by a smattering of other regional brews, the list of beers brewed in house was closer to 20-25. As I had never been to Destihl, I asked the bartender to select 4 beers for me to sample (this is typical practice for me -- a good bartender will ask the right questions and figure out what you like). He started by asking if I wanted darker or lighter beer, and then asked me about some different flavor profiles.  After a few questions, he came back with four delicious beers.  I tried the Roadblock British Red Ale, Black Angel Stout, Deadhead Double Red, and Antiquity Rye Wine.  All were really awesome.I was very pleased with the bartenders knowledge of the beer, the fast friendly service, and the atmosphere in general.Next time I'm in town this is DEFINITELY a place I plan to return, and hopefully next time I'll get to order some food as well.",

I couldn't get the Yelp App to check me in so I could upload my pic of the tastiest stout I've ever had, so you are just going to have to trust me on its delicousity. I tried a taster (4oz for $1.50) of their berry weiss beer and it was a little too much berry for me, but if you like that kind of thing, you will love Destihl's take on it: the flavors of sweet and tart bounce back and forth dynamically as you sip. A companion loved their IPA, lauding the freshness and the spicyness of the hops.The food is as good as anywhere else downtown. My table ordered the portabello sandwich which was really hearty and came with kettle chips with a touch of seasoning and Destihl's Kobe burger, which is served on a fancy bun I did non recognize and stacked with thick jalepeno bacon, bleu and white chedar cheeses, pickles, and comes with the best steak fries I've ever tasted. That burger is about the same price as Farren's and the verdict was it was just as good, if not better, owing to the extra special toppings. Destihl's fries are thick badasses with the skin on and huge flecks of kosher or sea salt and were both perfectly crispy and cooked the whole way thru. Those are served with their balsamic vinegar (and expresso bean?) barbecue sauce that is unlike any I've ever had. As good as the kettle chips are, I highly recommend you sub in for the steak fries (though I saw some gorgeous piles of sexy shoestring fries served with other dishes, giving me one more reason for a quick return).Another reason for a quick return is the very impressive menu. Vegetarian will have no problem here, nor will the health-concious. They have a wide and deep menu spanning from American classic pub fare to trendy fusion dishes usually found only in more expensive restaurants. Prices were not exceedingly low, however value is good. I did not see their spirits or wine menus, but the lineup behind the bar bodes well for those not in the mood for beer.This place takes the best of Boltini's, Seven Saints, the Pigs, Radio, and Bacaro and serves it up in a killer setting with great  modern ambiance. I will never pass up an invite to eat here.",

I don't like my burgers to have a ton of stuff on them because I like to taste the meat. One: they know how to cook meat \"medium\" (it's still slightly pink and perfect). Two: the meat tastes AMAZING! Whatever they do this is probably some of the best meat I've tasted. Tasty beer (they brew their own plus it's not over-carbonated) and the service is really good. Usually I don't really care about service but all of the service we've gotten from this place is setting the bar. The servers actually know what they are doing and what they are serving--plus they're all good looking! I absolutely love this place. Remember to bring your growlers because you can also purchase some of that yummy beer for later.",

The waiters and bartenders I've talked to have been incredibly friendly.The food's better than you'd expect, actually.  The salad was good, which is maybe not what you'd expect from a place that labels itself a brew pub.  The pizza's a little boring, but that's probably just the vegetarian ones I'm limited to.  They serve continuously, they have a large cocktail list, they take my American Express... it's everything a burgeoning yuppie alcoholic could want in a brew pub.Except that's not really me so here's what I don't like.The atmosphere.  As I read through the descriptions they say \"oh the atmosphere is great!\" and I say... are you at the same restaurant?  It's what a corporate design team thinks of as good atmosphere.  Large, airy, and completely devoid of personality.  It matches Jim Gould's across the street very well actually.The whole place really just reeks of chain, and I don't think that bothers most people at all but if I want to go in by myself and have a late lunch I feel very awkward.  I'm happy to go in with friends and have cocktails and split a pound of cake.  (They actually inform me that it is an 11 pound cake split 10 ways, so slightly more than a pound!)Worth checking out, if for no other reason than you too have probably been watching them work on this place for a couple years.  You can't NOT go.",

Strongly infatuated: \"he became besotted with his best friend's sister\".2. Intoxicated; drunk.Now, I am currently the first definition of besotted, with Destihl. I LOVED my visit. I went with Mr. Husband and a Very Close Friend (VCF) before seeing a movie at the Art Theater. Upon leaving, I may have been the second definition of besotted. (Just kidding, I only had one beer. I swear, my Yelp reviews make me sound like an alcoholic sometimes.)We went on a Monday evening around 6. We were seated right away. Mr. Husband and I had never been there, and we were surprised how big the restaurant actually is - it doesn't look that big from the outside. Our waiter came over right away and gave us a nice little menu introduction. I don't know why they've made a restaurant based on the things I personally like, but they did - I wanted EVERYTHING on the menu. Seriously. I haven't had such a hard time deciding on what to order for quite some time. VCF and I decided to split a small plate and an appetizer, so we got the 'House Olives' and the Bacon, Egg & Cheese deviled eggs. For my meal, I got the beer & cheddar soup and the spinach salad. VCF got the bison burger, and Mr. Husband got a special item, a bacon cheeseburger with sweet potato fries.Food: Very good, but to be honest, it *could* have been better. If Yelp let me give 4.5 stars, I would've. Everything was solid, but there were a couple things that might just push it over the top. For instance, the house olives small plate? It was agreed that it could be improved by serving the olives pre-chopped, not whole - sort of a mix between an olive salad and a tapenade. The deviled eggs were good, but the yolk was just a bit stiffer than I would've liked. The beer & cheddar soup was yum, but the scallions would have been a little better more finely sliced. The spinach salad was good, but the maple in the maple jalapeno bacon dressing was a little too sweet, and overpowered the other good stuff (grilled portabella mushroom? hell yes.) Another reason I'm torn: I love that they use ingredients from local places when possible, and have put an emphasis on sustainable farming. I'm all for buying locally and supporting small farms and businesses. On the other hand, the way it's flaunted just strikes me as a tad pretentious. Personal bias, but still.Service - Another ALMOST 5 stars. My only issue with our waiter was that he was TOO attentive. Really friendly, very knowledgeable about the menu, gave good recommendations, was able to tell us what HIS favorites are (it drives me crazy when waiters have no idea what's good on the menu.) However, he came by every 5 minutes or so. I always have mixed feelings about that. I like a server who is *there* when I need a water refill or a new fork, etc, but coming by too often just breaks up the conversation. Ambiance - Very cool. Very big-city. I like it. I also like that it's BIG. Ample room between tables. We chose a booth, and it was perfect. The noise level is ideal - quiet enough to talk at a normal level, loud enough that it doesn't feel like everyone in the area can hear what you're saying. Dessert - I can't tell you the last time I ordered dessert after dinner! That NEVER happens! (I actually can tell you, it was at my mom-in-law's birthday dinner in early October.) But VCF knows how to sweet-talk me into sweets (heh), and our waiter was VERY convincing when telling us about the stout ice cream sandwiches, which feature a housemade chocolate ice cream made with their own stout, served on chocolate brownies. Oh. Mah. Gah. SO GOOD. The stout ice cream was phenomenal. The dessert consists of two sandwiches, so you get four brownies and two scoops of ice cream. This would be great to  5 out of 5 stars for the dessert!! Price - Another 5 out of 5 stars. I was expecting that I'd have one entree and a beer. We ended up with a ton of food! For $38.77 before tip (I saved my receipt!), we got: -A soda-A 12 oz. beer - the Malius Apple Blonde Ale - so good!-House Olives app-Spinach salad-Soup-Bacon cheeseburger special-1/2 of the stout ice cream sandwichesSo while I can't yet give Destihl a 'best of the best' rating, I'm definitely a fan, and certainly willing to give it another few tries. I don't want to deter anyone from going here, because my visit was truly enjoyable. I'm already planning to permanently take Jim Gould out of my date-night lineup and replace it with Destihl. I just want to acknowledge that there is some room for improvement. I think with a tiny bit of tweaking, Destihl could easily be one of the top restaurants in C-U.",

You can also get growlers for like $20. Great deal. They generally have one of each type of brew and they're generally pretty solid brews. I got the Bela - Imperial Pilsner - which was great. Good, strong beer but very drinkable.This time I started with the Corn & Chicken chowder which has a bit of chipotle espresso BBQ sauce on top. Wonderful flavors, really was. Very delicate corn flavor mixed with the hint of bbq and given some weight from the just marginally creamy chowder. The soup was nothing short of phenomenal. Must Have.I then had the Farm & Field burger. Really interesting combination of flavors between the lamb and the bison within the patty and then it's topped with just a wonderful combination of delicious ingredients. Who would've thought that combining pesto, sun dried tomato aioli, havarti cheese, soy onions, etc on a burger would produce such an intriguing concoction of flavors!! My bun did come out quite burnt, but the rest of the burger made up for it.I'd get it again in a heartbeat.Only downside, no room for dessert.Can't wait to go back.",

The croquettes were run-of-the-mill, but good nonetheless.  The bacon was interesting, but certainly not a taste sensation.The main course were pretty variable.  My wife ordered the shrimp and grits - which was far too overpriced for such a meager portion.  Though, it was fairly tasty.  I ordered a Brewmaster's pizza which was very good.The main reason Destihl loses a star is the speed with which we received our drinks order.  It must have taken about 15 minutes after ordering for us to receive our drinks.  Eventually, we were informed of the backup at the bar.  I expect better though.Also, unrelated to my rating, there appeared to be a large number of employees standing around at the greeting station watching other employees working.  This could be training, then again, it could be the reason some of the food items are so expensive for the product!",

This place reminds me too much of the Jim Gould success failure story.  It's a tale of how a restaurant owner and chef become to sure of themselves and stop trying only to discover complete failure.  I pride myself in knowing good food and good restaurants.  I have studied cullinary technique and have a passion for fresh, quality ingredients that produces a meal that leaves you longing for more.  I write this review, having visited DESTIHL three times spread out over the course of a year.  I sent my food back two out of the three times.  The second time, I ordered the veggie burger which was hands down the WORST veggie burger I've ever sampled.  I did not send this back because it was not the way the burger was cooked, it was a pure and simple failure on the design.  My first experience I ordered swordfish.  It was overcooked, returned and cooked perfectly.  My husband ordered the Bison burger, medium rare and it came out well done.  While waiting for the food to return, the manager apologized and brought us free appetizers.  The meal ticket was reduced due to the error in the kitchen.  I was optimistic about this restaurant and the situation was handled perfectly.Last night, I returned for what I was hoping to be a perfect swordfish.  My husband's and I's order was the same.  Bison burger and swordfish.  First try at our order lended the same results.  Both dishes overcooked and returned.  Second try at our order, my husbands burger was cooked perfectly, my swordfish was raw.  Third try at the swordfish, still raw!  I changed my order to salmon at the waiter's recommendation.  Finally a manager appears and delivers the Salmon stating \"this is cooked to the chef's perfection.\"  The manager slither's off like a snake before I even touch the salmon.  Without cutting into the salmon, It was obvious that this fish was too raw.  My family had finished eating and after an hour and a half wait with no food, no appetizers, and a chef that I was now convinced can not cook at all, I ordered a Greek Salad.  This salad looked like someone threw the ingredients on my plate.  No order, presentation was horrible.  The dressing was red oil.  This dressing did not taste like greek dressing at all.  I ate the salad in disbelief that this place can not even prepare a good salad.  Our ticket was once again adjusted but this experience left a sour taste in my mouth.  I e-mailed the general manager and COO for the company and am awaiting a reply.  I would recommend no one go to this restaurant.  Seated across the street is Ko Fusion, an amazing restaurant.  This restaurant is too close for comfort for DESTIHL as this is where I will be seated watching DESTIHL's doors close for good if they do not find a chef that can cook the menu that was created.EDIT:  Less than 12 hours after my e-mail, I received a phone call from the general manager.  He was very kind and appologized.  More than this he listened.  He was kind and acknowledged that my concerns were valid.  He stated over and over again that there are no good excuses.  Humiliy allows for growth and I hope that this general managers humility induces change that produces solid growth.In March 2013, My husband and I used compensation cards to return.  The following is my email to the manager of destihl.I e-mailed back in October regarding a disappointing dinner and service that my family I experienced at Destihl Champaign.  We received compensation cards and returned tonight in order to assess if the service and food improved.  Our server was once again phenomenal, but the food was less than stellar.  My husband and I both ordered the swordfish, which were once again not cooked properly.  The swordfish were dry and over cooked, even upon reorder.  I guessed by the drying of the fish that a meat thermometer was used to assess if they were cooked properly, which in my opinion is an amateur error.  I then ordered a small portion Greek salad due to my hunger, my husband did not order one and we were charged for both.  I then ordered a gluten free Mediterranean pizza and my husband, a bone in ribeye.  My pizza could not possibly have been gluten free because within seconds, I felt sick and bloated and my husband's ribeye was cooked unevenly and dried out!  Most likely another piece of meat fallen victim to the meat thermometer.  With a history in restaurant service and cooking, I was appalled that we were charged for the salads and the pizza and were virtually comped nothing for the less than stellar food that we received.  Please do not send us any more compensation cards as we will not be returning, but I wanted to let you know that we are completely dissatisfied with ALL of our experiences at Destihl Champaign.",

I was also fond of the house drafts that I tried (including an apricot beer that's one of my favorite Belgians). The beers they brew onsite are all really good. The dessert menu is also fantastic- try the chocolate cake that's the size of your head if you're looking for diabetes. The Smores plate is also fun.All that said, the food here is a bit more expensive than it's worth. Burgers are cheaper (and better) at Farren's, Radio Maria has better Cubans for the price and the entrees are nothing too impressive- good, but not great. I've also found service to be a bit hit or miss- we've had waiters that have been remarkably friendly and courteous, but last time they substituted a more expensive glass of wine for one they apparently didn't have without telling us. I like going here, and it's a nice change of pace every once in a while, but rarely do I go \"Boy, we need to go to Desthil.\"",

For my main course, I ordered the Brewmaster's Pizza, which was served with chicken, andouille sausage, ale onions, and an espresso-chipotle barbecue sauce. The pizza was nothing to rave about, but it probably would have been quite a bit better if a) the pizza had been served hot instead of lukewarm and rapidly cooling, and b) the crust had been cooked all the way through. My brother's pizza was also apparently cold and undercooked, and reading through the other reviews, this seems to be common for diners at Destihl who order pizza. I think I've probably accumulated enough evidence at this point--Destihl is not worth the high prices. There are so many better restaurants in Champaign.",

I had their meatloaf dish, and I appreciate the idea of creating a blend of beef, bison, and lamb the loaf itself was over mixed and too dense.  The mashed potatoes seemed like they were made from a box, or they were over whipped, almost to a paste but there was enough butter to make them creamy.  The roasted vegetables were pretty good.

Easy going vibe, spacious bar, everything squeaky clean, good beers to sample and the good variety menu that goes along well with everything.  The sandwiches, soup and salads were excellent for lunch and there were plenty of people sampling the many items on the menu... which made it impossible for us to get a table the next night without waiting.  So next time when I go, I will make a reservation.",

It is one of those lovely little Midwestern university towns where one could spend a nice life far from the cut and thrust of city life. When in Champaign, one could do worse than to eat at Destihl. The place is modern brew pub of the sort that was popular in the late 90s in fleshpots like San Francisco. Get their flight, it is quite good. The Amber is sweet and floral. They serve nice gastro pub fare. I had the fish (of some sort) that was quite nice. Mid-west prices. Sit on the corner patio in front of Destihl, sipping their beer and watching the sunset on downtown Champagne. Good times.(Whew! So snobby!)",

Best part?  Small (4oz) tasting portions $1-2.  GREAT service.-Every time I visit my parents in good ol' Chambana they have a \"new restaurant in town\" that hubby and I MUST try.  Or five.  This time, Destihl was first on their list... and they are so crazy about it, they took us twice.  In ONE DAY.First, for lunch.  No beer this visit (hence the second), just lunch.  I had the Portabella Sandwich with Shoestring Fries, and it was 100% delish.  Also on the table:- Stuffed poblano pepper- Cuban sandwich- Salad with ahi tuna- Clam chowder I heard nothing but raves from the group.Late that evening we stopped in for post-dinner drinks \"and maybe a little to munch on.\"  We got three appetizers for the table:- Chorizo & Potato Flautas- Marinated Cucumbers (there's some BITE to those suckers!)- Brewmaster's Pizza (yuuuuuumm)... and all got a few 4oz tasting pours.  The beer was fantastic, some of the best I've had.  Our waiters both times were friendly and went out of their way to make sure we had a good time.One of my favorite things about this restaurant is the story my dad told (more than once) about his friend's first visit.  They were a big group, 12 I think, and stopping in before seeing a show in downtown.  They ordered food, drinks, then dessert.  There was a delay in the kitchen and they were kept waiting on their dessert for quite while... they were now running short on time, so one of the guys flagged down their waiter and told him, maybe a touch rudely, that they \"needed either dessert or the check, because we gotta get out of here.\"  The manager came back a couple of minutes later, apologized profusely, and served their dessert.  Dessert or check, and Destihl chose dessert.  Their meal and drinks for 12 were on the house.It's those kinds of stories that spread your business' name in the best possible way - you chose wisely, Destihl.  The guy's been sending over everyone he knows, always prompting with \"you gotta hear how amazingly this restaurant treated me!\"",

I was mentally writing my review all throughout dinner, and it was a solid 4 stars--until the bill came. Don't get me wrong, I am happy to pay for amazing food, but it's gotta be spot-on. Our dinner for 2 was $120, after tip. We had 2 drinks each, an appetizer, two entrees, and a dessert. I've definitely paid this much before for a comparable amount of food, but that was at some of my favorite restaurants that make sure every detail is perfect. And everything at Destihl was good, but not perfect.Here's what we had:--Stuffed dates - These had a great sweet/salty/spicy balance, but the barbecue sauce was a bit too much and a little detracting.--Mustard-glazed chicken - The chicken itself was delicious, but there was too much mustard sauce. The fingerling potatoes and green beans were both good, but not well-seasoned. The dish also didn't come out super hot.--Espresso-rubbed steak - The steak was huge and cooked well, and it had great flavor. Not my favorite steak, but still good. --Bruleed banana pudding - They made this gluten-free for me by not having pie crust, and it was phenomenal. It was the star of the show! I am still dreaming of this.The interior of Destihl is very nice--what you'd expect at an upscale gastropub. Our server was also very nice, but he was a bit new and didn't quite know the menu well yet.While I'm not head over heals for this place, I do think it's a great addition to the downtown Champaign scene! I would definitely come back the next time I'm in the city... especially for that banana pudding.",

I finally came back a year or so later and the food has definitely gotten better.This time I went for lunch and had the swordfish tacos with rice and beans on the side.   This was pretty good.  Maybe just a bit heavy on the sauce which masked a lot of the fish but the chimichurri sauce itself was good.  My wife had the chimichurri shrimp pizza and hers was excellent!  I also have to mention the last time I was here I had the beer-brined double bone in pork chop and that was easily the best dish I had here.After a few early lackluster visits this place is slowly becoming one of the better restaurants in the area.",

The bacon wasn't crispy so it was tough to chew. The sauce was so spicy we were practically crying. Salmon sandwich special was not as good as anticipated, and the bacon on the bacon cheeseburger was also not crispy. The service was so-so. While our waiter at the beginning was friendly, he repeatedly forgot things so we would spend time sitting there staring at our food because we didn't have plates or silverware. They also ran out of wine glasses so we were left sitting through our entrees without drinks that were ordered before entrees arrived, and he didn't tell us until we were finished eating.Overall, it'd be worth a shot to visit again but if the 2nd experience was similar or worse, I wouldn't try a 3rd time.",

Because of the variety, I think this is a great place to bring a group or a date if you're not sure what type of food they prefer.  The beer is all brewed at Destihl and is decent, but I've never been blown away by any of their brews.  I have been here several times and my favorite dish so far was the Cedar Plank Salmon. On my most recent trip I ordered the Kobe Burger and when I ran out of sauce, the server asked if I would like more.   I am not a dessert person, but I LOVE their dessert menu.  So, do yourself a favor and save room for dessert!Be warned, if you sit in the bar area be prepared to wait. I have actually left a few times when I haven't been given water or a menu 15 minutes after arriving.  If you sit in the main dining room however, the service is superb.",

I have to say that I found it very amusing that the priciest restaurant I went to on this trip was also the worst meal of the trip by far.I ordered the goat-cheese pesto pizza, shared the battered asparagus appetizer, and had pint of the brown ale. The battered asparagus was alright but EXTREMELY greasy, the pizza was soggy and surprisingly didn't really taste like basil or goat cheese, and the brown ale was flat out bad (trust me, I drink a lot of microbrew beer, I know what good beer tastes like). Plus, most other people at my table agreed that their food and drinks were also mediocre. Needless to say, since this is an pricier restaurant, I doubt I'd be willing to give Destihl another shot.",

The soup and sandwiches were top notch.   I know there are a lot of restaurants in the C/U area, but you can't go wrong here.

She did not steer me wrong.  It was so tasty that I wanted to eat another entree of it.  Every dish they brought to the table look so tempting.  Definitely a wide variety and everyone enjoyed a nice beer and atmosphere.  Glad we made reservations because the place filled up quick for a Friday night.

I drove through Illinois on a day trip and passed the Destihl sister location in Normal early in the morning before they had opened, so I decided to stay overnight in Champaign to visit the other Destihl location. I ordered the Red Chili Pork entree and it was, quite simply, remarkable. [note: I posted a tryptich Instagram photo of my dining experience here on Yelp] I also sampled several of their beer offerings, conveniently (and affordably) sold in 4 oz. taster glasses. All were more than satisfactory as compared to other microbreweries, of which I have been to many. The interior is also pleasant, being situated in a newly constructed building. There is outdoor seating, which was in high demand on the warm early evening I was here in late June. As one who travels a lot for work, I can strongly recommend this restaurant.",

Also sampled 3 of the beers...really enjoy the 4 oz options so I can try a few different varieties.We were satisfied with our entrees...a pork tenderloin special and the flat iron steak. Great flavors and cooked the way we ordered.Best part is probably dessert. The smores are a fun, gooey mess and the cherry bread pudding was tasty.We dined on a Saturday night, which was also prom night in the area and a busy sports night (we were seated in the bar area), so it was a bit noisy.

Nowhere near medium! On top of that, it was smothered with caramelized onions, which were very strong and took away from the taste of the steak! The service was average. Nothing great. Overall, I would never consider going back. I can find a better steak sandwich for a lot less at a number of different area restaurants. Coincidentally, I spoke to a friend about my experience weeks later when Destihl came up in conversation, only to find out that she had the exact situation happen to her when she visited Destihl. Her steak sandwich was extremely undercooked as well. Must be a common trend with this place. Just another common chain restaurant, as far as I'm concerned!",

Their in house brewery interested me too.I haven't been to a restaurant where they offered 4oz sample sizes of beers. I got the \"Matt and the Giant Juicy Juicy Mango IPA.\" I'm not the biggest fan of beer, but this wasn't that bad to me and also it was nice to have just a sample size so I don't waste any beer.My friend and I started out with the appetizer, chorizo stuffed dates. I have never tried these and I thought that These were amazing. The perfect blend of spicy, savory and sweet. I got the Weissenheimer Chicken. I have to compliment the chef on how juicy the chicken was. It was a big piece of chicken and not one bit dry. I thought the green beans weren't cooked as long, but the mashed potatoes were really good.My friend got the Brewmaster's pizza. I liked that it was a personal pizza and they also offer gluten free bread. It's nice that this restaurant is conscious about that.The service was awesome too. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and attentive.I felt like some foods had a spicy twist on them which I think is a nice flavor to pair with IPAs.I didn't get to try any desserts because the kitchen closed. I know so sad because I went there wanting the dessert the most, but at least my appetizer and entree was good.",

I've tried the seared scallops over curried mashed potatoes and the thai half chicken. The scallops were hardly seared and the potatoes were waaaaay over salted. The chicken on the other hand was far under spiced and seasoned. I will say their beer battered jalepeno bacon is delicious but deep fried food is pretty hard to screw up. Overall the prospect of having a modern american restaurant with an eclectic menu in the CU area is a great one, but a bit more attention to detail would greatly help Destihl.",

The decor is surprisingly upscale - really cool use of natural stone and wood. HUGE shame they didn't open with their patio ready to go, but when I inquired they said it was in the plans to open the patio soon.The beers (I tried 5, yup 5) were decent - not world-class, but decent. My favorite purely for summer drinkability was the Champaign Blonde, but I am admittedly not into dark beers at all, and there are PLENTY of dark ones and heavier Begian-style ales which I didn't try.The menu looked surprisingly interesting, (I was expecting burgers and pretzels), and between us we tried the pickled cucumber salad, the tuna carpaccio, the strawberry salad and the warm salmon and potato salad. All four dishes were winners, although the small plates ARE really small (which is exactly what we wanted). The entrees are MASSIVE for the price, and look like they are high quality meals, but I'm glad we saw how big they were before we ordered one!Service was excellent from beginning to end.The desserts also looks amazing, but I was too full to try. As a gay couple it was nice to feel comfortable and that there was a real mix of clientele - I was scared it was going to be exclusively Olive Garden-goers, but there were some hipsters, some queens, and some students as well as your typical 'casual-dining' crowd.Can't wait for the patio to open, but believe me, there will be a serious wait time on those tables - be prepared!",

I suggested we try Destihl after having a pretty good experience there with my family last time. This visit was equally as good!We opted to sit at the bar and watch the Bulls game due to the dining room wait being around 35 minutes which was much too long for two very hungry college kids.We started with a few 4oz beer samples which are very convenient and not too expensive, I dislike having to commit to a roughly $5 16oz beer not knowing much beforehand. I particularly enjoyed the oatmeal nitro but didn't much care for the Champaign blonde.The beer-battered bacon was a must-try for us since I didn't get it last time and it gets a lot of attention here on Yelp. We also opted for the cheese curds, both of these appetizers were so artery-cloggingly delicious.The Bulls started to seriously disappoint us and when our food arrived we were glad to have something else to focus on, rather than the demise of Chicago basketball this season. I ordered the meatloaf and my roommate got the rancher burger. He said his was really tasty, right up there with the burger we had at Farren's a few weaks earlier. I went with the meatloaf to try something different and when it came out I was initially a little taken aback, but after trying it that all changed. This was not your grandmother's meatloaf! It was rolled up and wrapped in prosciutto sitting on a mountain of mashed potatoes adorned with some thinly sliced vegetables all inside a cast iron skillet. The meatloaf itself was well seasoned and actually had a little spice to it. What really made this dish though was the prosciutto, it added that nice smoky pork flavor to the meatloaf. I highly recommend this dish!The service was a little different because we were at the bar. The bar staff was extremely busy due to having a packed dining room and fairly full bar as well. There were about two people taking care of us and they made sure we always had beer and were quick to clear our plates as well as check in frequently. Service: great!Overall, another great experience at Destihl. Though, like I mentioned last time, it comes a bit of a steeper price than some other potential options nearby. Either way, we really liked our food.",

Western civilization pivots on the ability to look down and see if there are feet under the door and thus realize that you have to wait a minute instead of jiggling the door handle like some pee-filled serial killer).  The service was equally uninspired -- my least favorite combination of ingratiatingly peppy and incompetent, and the food was mediocre when it got there. It took so long to appear at the table that I was sort of hoping that the cook had sent out for it from another restaurant, but no such luck.  And I only thought this might be the case because the menu says that the kitchen likes to get food from local sources. This might be technically true -- they might like it -- but there's not much evidence that they actually do it.  I think I can honestly say that the last time I experienced this kind of ambience I was in an airport restaurant.",

Two of my friends and I wandered in on a weekday night while looking for a place to eat at in downtown Champaign. The restaurant was relatively full for 7pm on Thursday, so I'd imagine there may be a wait on weekend nights. Beers = good. I think we tried 4? The strawberry blonde ale on tap was a clear favorite for us. Both their beer and dinner menus took awhile for us to look at. I was expecting traditional pub-style food, but their offerings far exceeded that.We started off with the deviled egg appetizer and the beer battered bacon appetizer. Both were very good- the beer battered bacon is a MUST. Jalapeno bacon in a tempura-like beer batter coating topped with a drizzle of maple chipotle glaze?! Yes please! When it came to our table, we slowly stopped talking and watched our plate of bacon descend in front of us. Like it came down straight from heaven. We didn't even realize we stopped talking and didn't remember what we were talking about until the bacon was gone..My friends got the jambalaya and the prosciutto-wrapped meatloaf. I really only tried part of the super tasty andouille sausage corn muffin that came with the jambalaya, as I was working on my full slab of beer-braised ribs (I gave one rib each to my friends to try though). They were perfect. Orders of magnitude better than Black Dog's ribs. I'm not sure whether or not that's a fair comparison since it's different cooking styles, but the texture of Destihl's ribs was absolutely perfect- tender, falling off the bone, but not annoyingly so.. The flavor was great also, as it tasted lovely by itself and did not need to be hidden behind sauce although the chipotle espresso bbq sauce it came with was also very tasty. My friends and I agreed that I \"won\" dinner since I ordered the best dish. My only qualm was that my shoestring fries were a little soggy and not as crispy as I would have preferred. But that's very minor.We were all pretty full, but could not pass up dessert. Like the rest of their menus, the dessert menu had a lot of tasty-sounding options. After some rock/paper/scissors, we ended up ordering the stout ice cream sandwiches which is more like four round brownie patties a la mode. But by all means, if you really wanted to, I guess you could try to eat it ice cream sandwich style. The alcohol in the chocolate stout ice cream wasn't very strong. Both the ice cream and the brownies were stellar. My friends especially loved the brownies. I was wondering what they did with the remaining brownie part after cutting out the rounds (to, you know, save waste if need be), and our waitress told us that the remainder is used for their chocolate martini? Maybe I'll check that out next time. Oh, and also, our waitress was very nice and friendly too. Overall, good service, clean place, nice decor.. everything was great. After tips, came out to ~$30/person, but actually filling up me + two guys  does require a bit of food and drink. I'm already trying to think of when I will return to try the kobe burger..",

                "review": "Hmm.  The problem with Destihl is that it's either GOOD or it's BAD.  That's kind of why the review is an in-between.  This place is off the charts when it comes to liquor.  Just don't buy booze here.  That's my honest feedback.  We had a party of 8, once, and only a few drinks were ordered (a couple waters, two ordered pop) and the bill was something astronomical (like $180!).  The other thing about Destihl is that it's a microbrewery (and,-cough-, gastropub) that's trying to be a microbrewery and a -cough- gastropub, if you catch my drift?  If not, here's the thing-- it's pretentious as all get out.  And for who knows what reason, really.  It's kind of a dimly lit restaurant/bar that's just as non-descript as any other.  It tries too hard to be what it thinks it is, and doesn't try hard enough to be a good restaurant.With that said, though, some of their food is just out-of-the-ballpark, OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD awesome.  All of their soups (3 cheese and ale, or the tomato basil).  The Havarti and Turkey is lovely, as is the Cuban style pork (tho, I did find a very unappetizing piece of fat in it the very last time I had it, so it kind of put me off it for a while).You can't go wrong with a burger. =)  But, then again, it's a burger, they're not reinventing the airplane.I say... if you want to spend a mint for the possibility of some good food, and then an outrageous bar tab, pick Destihl.  But if you're looking for beer and semi-comparable food, check out Hooters or Buffalo Wild Wings. The same in theory, just a different point-of-view.",

                "review": "Another fun new restaurant we tried in Champaign!  My daughter who lives there is moving to Spain so we are letting her choose whenever we go down for football games and she has been picking some winners.This is a sleek, clean, modern space.  There are beer vats as you enter which add a nice vibe of authenticity.  We were seated right away at a very comfortable table for the four of us.  We tried the deviled eggs app and some gingery egg rolls, we all split them and liked them.  Both had a bit of a kick, the egg roll sauce had the most kick and I found this out after I had drizzled it all over mine but I still enjoyed it immensely, I just drank some extra water.Everyone tried a cup of soup because hey, soup is good food.  I gobbled up every bit of my beer cheese soup, so light and flavorful.  I loved it!  With my swordfish tacos I had an amazing iced tea, it was just a lovely flavorful tea with an orange slice.  The swordfish tacos were divine but if you are a bit of a spice wimp (like me) you might want the guac on the side, that is where the heat was for sure!  I ended up just eating the fish out of the taco, it was just too picante for me!  I adored the rice, bean, corn side dish.  Just delicious!For dessert, we all split a sour cherry bread pudding and I really liked it.  It came with ice cream and it was just smooth, sweet and a bit of tangy with that nice cold creamy spot of the ice cream.  I am not a huge bread pudding fan but I think I could become one!This was a very enjoyable meal.  The team had played lousy, my daughter is moving, I needed a culinary hug and this was it!  I would definitely come back but sadly it won't be with my youngest!  Why don't you meet us so I won't miss her?",

                "review": "I was really excited to try Destihl, but unfortunately the experience fell a little flat. My friend and I arrived a little after 7 on a Friday night and was told the wait would be about 40 minutes since we didn't have reservations. No problem. After only about 20-25 minutes our pager buzzed, so score! So far so good. Our server was really nice and attentive, nothing negative to say about him. However, the food is another story.We started with the cheese curds for an appetizer. And these were awesome, plus they give you a lot. The only part of the meal that really stood out, sadly. I'd had my eye on the strawberry goat cheese salad, so I got that and split the pesto goat cheese pizza. The salad had a lot of potential with all the seemingly good ingredients, but was just off. The spinach tasted wrong and it would have been much better with mixed greens. The \"strawberry\" part of the salad consisted of maybe three tiny pieces and the goat cheese wasn't even very good. It mainly was made up of mandarin oranges and ill-tasting spinach.I'm not a huge fan of wood-fired pizza (I prefer almost any other type of crust). My friend and I split a pizza, but I saw plenty of people putting one away all by themselves. It is very thin. The toppings were ok, but I didn't like how the goat cheese was in big globs instead of spread over the whole pizza.We left without getting dessert, but I saw a few and they are possibly the biggest desserts I've ever seen anywhere. This isn't a good thing. Probably 3-4 people should be splitting on dessert, but I'm guessing that doesn't happen that often. So just be aware if you do order that piece of cake.Besides the service, the other positive is the price. Everything is fairly cheap. But that coincides with the quality, so just beware.",

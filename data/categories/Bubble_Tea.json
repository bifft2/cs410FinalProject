For those looking for real bubble tea that's not over sugary with a plethora of flavors, look no further!

I do enjoy the taro milk tea though! I also really like their cartoon animal cups and lid covers that sort of teach you Chinese fruit names. Depending on when you come, there may be a large crowd of people, which means your order will take some time to make as they make everything to order - nothing is premade. Also, they don't allow for customizations. You can only get what's offered on the menu - no fruit substitutions, etc. Unfortunately, there are only two tables to sit at, so you'll likely be standing around while waiting. I hope they'll get more chairs and tables because there's a lot more room in the shop.My one pet peeve is that some of the fruit syrup they use to flavor their milk teas tastes weirdly artificial. I got a strawberry milk tea and it tasted like I was drinking a liquid, watered down strawberry ring pop. I tried a friend's mango green tea and it was ridiculously sweet with a tang of mango. Otherwise, it's not very remarkable milk tea that would make me come back.I'd give them two and a half stars, but I bumped it to three because the service is really nice and the employees do try very hard to get the orders correct. Also, when I came on Friday as they were closing up and finishing the last orders, the owner lady gave me and my friends free drinks to try anyway, which was sweet of her. Everything on the menu is relatively inexpensive and under $5.",

I ended up getting a taro bubble tea and the gf got matcha milk tea.  Not sure if it's a promo or something but the tea was free!  Whoo hoo.
